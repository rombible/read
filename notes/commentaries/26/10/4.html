Here it is thought to designate, not the four living creatures of the vision, but the cherubim overshadowing the mercy-seat, and to indicate that the manifestation of the Divine presence now left the Holy of Holies, and went to the threshold of the door of the house, preparatory to leaving it altogether. The expression is obscure, since the place of the manifestation of the Divine presence in the most holy place is usually described as “between the cherubim” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-89.htm" title="And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking to him from off the mercy seat that was on the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spoke to him.">Numbers 7:89</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm" title="The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: he sits between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.">Psalm 99:1</a>, &c.). Of the main point, however, there can be no doubt—that the Divine presence is represented as in the act of leaving the Temple. “The house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord’s glory” as He departed, in striking contrast with the similar manifestations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/40-34.htm" title="Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,">1Kings 8:10-11</a>), when God accepted the tabernacle and the Temple as the peculiar place of His abode.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-4.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory....">Ezekiel 10:4-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub — </span>In token of his departure from the temple.

Or, "cherubim"; those that were upon the mercy seat, between which the Shechinah or glorious majesty of God dwelt, in the most holy place: this is a token and intimation of the Lord's leaving of the temple; and a little before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, to which this vision chiefly, if not together, refers, a voice was heard in the temple, <p>"let us go hence (b):'' <p>and stood over the threshold of the house; either of the holy of holies, from whence he was removing; or rather of the holy place, the court of the priests, the inward court, and so open to the outward court, and view of the people in it: <p>and the house was filled with the cloud; the temple, being forsaken of God, was filled with darkness; as an emblem of that blindness which is come upon the Jews, and will continue on them till the fulness of the Gentiles brought in: <p>and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory; either the inward court, as the glory of the Lord passed through it, from the holy of holies; or rather the outward court, of which mention is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a>; the glory of the Lord being on the threshold Of the house, which looked towards that, and so enlightened it. This outward court signifies the Gentiles; who, when the Lord removed from the Jewish nation and people, were favoured with the glorious light of the Gospel, and ordinances of Christ; whereby they were enlightened, and filled with the knowledge of the Lord; with the knowledge of him, who is the brightness of his father's glory, and the express image of his person; so through the fall of the Jews salvation came to the Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>. <p>(b) Josephus de Bello Judaeorum, l. 6. c. 5, sect. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then the glory of the LORD <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> went up from the cherub, <i>and stood</i> over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory.</span><p>(c) Meaning that the glory of God would depart from the temple.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">Then the glory went up</span>] This can hardly be rendered, and … <span class="ital">had gone up;</span> consequently the implication in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm" title="Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.">Ezekiel 10:1</a></span> that the glory had returned to the cherubim from the threshold is confirmed.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Angels which Smite Jerusalem<p>At the call of Jehovah, His servants appear to execute the judgment. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Ezekiel 9:1</a>.

This rendering does not suit the context, since it is not the punishments that are introduced, but the men who execute them; and it is not established by the usage of the language. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; is frequently used, no doubt, in the sense of visitation or chastisement (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>); but it is not met with in the plural in this sense. In the plural it only occurs in the sense of supervision or protectorate, in which sense it occurs not only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11</a>, but also (in the singular) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>, and as early as <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-38.htm">Numbers 3:38</a>, where it relates to the presidency of the priests, and very frequently in the Chronicles. Consequently &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; are those whom God has appointed to watch over the city, the city-guard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>), - not earthly, but heavenly watchmen, - who are now to inflict punishment upon the ungodly, as the authorities appointed by God. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is an imperative Piel, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21</a>, and must not be altered into &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; (Kal), as Hitzig proposes. The Piel is used in an intransitive sense, festinanter appropinquavit, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-8.htm">Ezekiel 36:8</a>. The persons called come by the way of the upper northern gate of the temple, to take their stand before Jehovah, whose glory had appeared in the inner court. The upper gate is the gate leading from the outer court to the inner, or upper court, which stood on higher ground, - the gate mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a>. In the midst of the six men furnished with smashing-tools there was one clothed in white byssus, with writing materials at his side. The dress and equipment, as well as the instructions which he afterwards receives and executes, show him to be the prince or leader of the others.<p>Kliefoth calls in question the opinion that these seven men are angels; but without any reason. Angels appearing in human form are frequently called &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, according to their external habitus. But the number seven neither presupposes the dogma of the seven archangels, nor is copied from the seven Parsic amschaspands. The dress worn by the high priest, when presenting the sin-offering on the great day of atonement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>), was made of &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, i.e., of white material woven from byssus thread (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>). It has been inferred from this, that the figure clothed in white linen was the angel of Jehovah, who appears as the heavenly high priest, to protect and care for his own. In support of this, the circumstance may be also adduced, that the man whom Daniel saw above the water of the Tigris, and whose appearance is described, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>, in the same manner as that of Jehovah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-27</a>, and that of the risen Christ in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-15</a>, appears clothed in &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6-7</a>).<p>(Note: &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is rendered by the lxx, in the passage before us, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#837;. It is in accordance with this that Christ is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a> as clothed with a &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, and not after <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>, as Hengstenberg supposes. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>, the Septuagint has &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd; or &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;. In other places, the Sept. rendering of &#1489;&#1468;&#1491; is &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (thus <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>, etc.); and hence the &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a> answers to the &#1489;&#1468;&#1491; made of &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and is really the same as the &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>.)<p>Nevertheless, we cannot regard this view as established. The shining white talar, which is evidently meant by the plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, occurring only here and in Daniel (ut. sup.), is not a dress peculiar to the angel of Jehovah or to Christ. The seven angels, with the vials of wrath, also appear in garments of shining white linen (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a>); and the shining white colour, as a symbolical representation of divine holiness and glory (see comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>), is the colour generally chosen for the clothing both of the heavenly spirits and of "just men made perfect" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). Moreover, the angel with the writing materials here is described in a totally different manner from the appearance of Jehovah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10</a>, or that of Christ in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>; and there is nothing whatever to indicate a being equal with God. Again, the distinction between him and the other six men leads to no other conclusion, than that he stood in the same relation to them as the high priest to the Levites, or the chancellor to the other officials. This position is indicated by the writing materials on his hips, i.e., in the girdle on his hips, in which scribes in the East are accustomed to carry their writing materials (vid., Rosenmller, A. u. N. Morgenland, IV. p. 323). He is provided with these for the execution of the commission given to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a>. In this way the description can be very simply explained, without the slightest necessity for our resorting to Babylonian representations of the god Nebo, i.e., Mercury, as the scribe of heaven. The seven men take their station by the altar of burnt-offering, because the glory of God, whose commands they were about to receive, had taken up its position there for the moment (Kliefoth); not because the apostate priesthood was stationed there (Hvernick). The glory of Jehovah, however, rose up from the cherub to the threshold of the house. The meaning of this is not that it removed from the interior of the sanctuary to the outer threshold of the temple-building (Hvernick), for it was already stationed, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, above the cherub, between the porch and the altar. It went back from thence to the threshold of the temple-porch, through which one entered the Holy Place, to give its orders there. The reason for leaving its place above the cherubim (the singular &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; is used collectively) to do this, was not that "God would have had to turn round in order to address the seven from the throne, since, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, He had gone from the north gate of the outer court into the inner court, and His servants had followed Him" (Hitzig); for the cherubim moved in all four directions, and therefore God, even from the throne, could turn without difficulty to every side. God left His throne, that He might issue His command for the judgment upon Israel from the threshold of the temple, and show Himself to be the judge who would forsake the throne which He had assumed in Israel. This command He issues from the temple court, because the temple was the place whence God attested Himself to His people, both by mercy and judgment. </body></html>
