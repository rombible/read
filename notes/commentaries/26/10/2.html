It is not without significance that now the same person is made the agent of judgment. As God’s love is turned to wrath by man’s impenitence, and as His blessings given to man become curses by their abuse, so those employed by Him as the instruments of His loving-kindness become the very executioners of his “fury.” The “coals of fire,” the symbols of Divine wrath, are represented as “between the cherubim.” In every possible way it is signified that the impending doom is not from man’s will, however men may be used as its instruments, or from any accident, but from God Himself.<p><span class= "bld">Scatter them over the city.</span>—For its destruction.

And He took me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and behold, at the entrance into the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, as it were five and twenty men,with their backs towards the temple of Jehovah and their faces towards the east; they were worshipping the sun towards the east. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>. And He said to me, Seest thou this, son of Man? Is it too little for the house of Judah to perform the abominations which they are performing here, that they also fill the land with violence, and provoke me to anger again and again? For behold they stretch out the vine-branch to their nose. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-18.htm">Ezekiel 8:18</a>. But I also will act in fury; my eye shall not look compassionately, and I will not spare; and if they cry with a loud voice in my ears, I will not hear them. - After Ezekiel has seen the idolatrous abominations in the outer court, or place for the people, he is taken back into the inner court, or court of the priests, to see still greater abominations there. Between the porch of the temple and the altar of burnt-offering, the most sacred spot therefore in the inner court, which the priests alone were permitted to tread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>), he sees as if twenty-five men, with their backs toward the temple, were worshipping the sun in the east. &#1499;&#1468; before &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is not a preposition, circa, about, but a particle of comparison (an appearance): as if twenty-five men; after the analogy of &#1499;&#1468; before an accusative (vid., Ewald, 282d). For the number here is not an approximative one; but twenty-five is the exact number, namely, the twenty-four leaders of the classes of priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-5.htm">Ezra 10:5</a>), with the high priest at the head (see Lightfoot's Chronol. of O.T., Opp. I. 124). As the whole nation was seen in the seventy elders, so is the entire priesthood represented here in the twenty-five leaders as deeply sunk in disgraceful idolatry. Their apostasy from the Lord is shown in the fact that they turn their back upon the temple, and therefore upon Jehovah, who was enthroned in the temple, and worship the sun, with their faces turned towards the east. The worship of the sun does not refer to the worship of Adonis, as Hvernick supposes, although Adonis was a sun-god; but generally to the worship of the heavenly bodies, against which Moses had warned the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>), and which found its way in the time of Manasseh into the courts of the temple, whence it was afterwards expelled by Josiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>). The form &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; must be a copyist's error for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;; as the supposition that it is an unusual form, with a play upon &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;,<p>(Note: "An extraordinary form, invented for the purpose of more effectually expressing their extraordinary abomination." - Lightfoot.)<p>is precluded by the fact that it would in that case be a 2nd per. plur. perf., and such a construction is rendered impossible by the &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; which immediately precedes it (cf. Ewald, 118a).<p>To these idolatrous abominations Judah has added other sins, as if these abominations were not bad enough in themselves. This is the meaning of the question in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>, '&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;: is it too little for the house of Judah, etc.? &#1504;&#1511;&#1500; with &#1502;&#1503;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. To indicate the fulness of the measure of guilt, reference is again briefly made to the moral corruption of Judah. &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; embraces all the injuries inflicted upon men; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, impiety towards God, i.e., idolatry. By violent deeds they provoke God repeatedly to anger (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, followed by an infinitive, expresses the repetition of an action). The last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a> ('&#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;) is very obscure. The usual explanation, which has been adopted by J. D. Michaelis and Gesenius: "they hold the twig to their nose," namely, the sacred twig Barsom, which the Parsees held in their hands when praying (vid., Hyde, de relig. vet. Pars. p. 350, ed. 2; and Kleuker, Zend-Avesta, III. p. 204), suits neither the context nor the words. According to the position of the clause in the context, we do not expect an allusion to a new idolatrous rite, but an explanation of the way in which Judah had excited the wrath of God by its violent deeds. Moreover, &#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; is not a suitable word to apply to the Barsom - Zemo&#772;ra&#770;h is a shoot or tendril of the vine (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23</a>). The Barsom, on the other hand, consisted of bunches of twigs of the tree Gez or Hom, or of branches of the pomegranate, the tamarisk, or the date (cf. Kleuker l.c., and Strabo, XV. 733), and was not held to the nose, but kept in front of the mouth as a magical mode of driving demons away (vid., Hyde, l.c.). Lastly, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1488;&#1500; does not mean to hold anything, but to stretch out towards, to prepare to strike, to use violence. Of the other explanations given, only two deserve any consideration - namely, first, the supposition that it is a proverbial expression, "to apply the twig to anger," in the sense of adding fuel to the fire, which Doederlein (ad Grotii adnott.) applies in this way, "by these things they supply food, as it were, to my wrath, which burns against themselves," i.e., they bring fuel to the fire of my wrath. Lightfoot gives a similar explanation in his Hor. hebr. ad <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>. The second is that of Hitzig: "they apply the sickle to their nose," i.e., by seeking to injure me, they injure themselves. In this case &#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; must be taken in the sense of &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, a sickle or pruning-knife, and pointed &#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;. The saying does appear to be a proverbial one, but the origin and meaning of the proverb have not yet been satisfactorily explained. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-18.htm">Ezekiel 8:18</a>. Therefore will the Lord punish unsparingly (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-9.htm">Ezekiel 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>). This judgment he shows to the prophet in the two following chapters. </body></html>
