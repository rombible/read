They were now just on the eve of going away, and the movement was a great one, so that the sound was “heard even to the outer court” Throughout this chapter the s in cherubims is quite unnecessary, since cherubim is already the Hebrew plural of cherub.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.">Ezekiel 10:6-7</a> are not subsequent in time to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm" title="And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.">Ezekiel 10:5</a>, but are simply a more particular account, given parenthetically, of what had already been briefly mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.">Ezekiel 10:2</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-8.htm" title="And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.">Ezekiel 10:8-17</a> are largely a repetition of the description of the vision in Ezekiel 1, but it is here given in parts, parenthetically, in connection with the progress of the narrative. The course of the narrative itself is as follows :—After the man in linen has gone out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-7.htm" title="And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.">Ezekiel 10:7</a>), a command is issued, “O wheel.” They were to set themselves in motion. Then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15</a>) they “were lifted up,” and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-18.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>) “the glory of the Lord departed” from the Temple, and “mounted up from the earth.” The repetition of the description of Ezekiel 1 is by no means accidental, but serves partly to connect the various particulars with the course of the symbolic narrative, and mainly to emphasize the identity of the glory departing from the Temple with the Divine glory before seen. There are, however, several variations from the former description. Particularly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-12.htm" title="And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.">Ezekiel 10:12</a> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>) there is mention of the abundance of eyes, a symbol of vigilance and activity, covering the whole body of the cherubim and the wheels. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-14.htm" title="And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 10:14</a>, after saying that “every one had four faces,” as in Ezekiel 1, the particular faces are described, but with this important variation :—the first is said to be “the face of a cherub,” instead of “the face of an ox,” as in Ezekiel 1; more exactly it is “the face of <span class= "ital">the </span>cherub,” since the Hebrew has the definite article. The reason of this variation and the meaning of “the face of the cherub” are both obscure. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-22.htm" title="And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.">Ezekiel 10:22</a> it is expressly said that their faces were the same as those seen by the Chebar; and again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15-20</a>, the whole vision is described as the “living creature” seen by the Chebar. It is plain, therefore, that the variation is only in the description, and not in the thing described. The most natural solution of the difficulty in the text as it stands is that a cherub was ordinarily represented with the face of an ox. But there is no evidence of this, and it is not impossible that a slight error may have been introduced into the text. The Greek version did not contain the verse in the time of St. Jerome, and in its Roman form does not now. It was introduced into the Alexandrian copies from the later version of Theodotion, and Theodoret does not recognise it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 The fire being taken from between the wheels, under the cherubim, ch. 1:13, seems to have signified the wrath of God to be executed upon Jerusalem.

The language of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-18.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:18</a></span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm" title="And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;">Ezekiel 9:3</a>) excludes the supposition that the cherubim as well as the glory moved towards the threshold (Ew.). Jehovah’s “speaking” is the thunder (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm" title="And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.">Ezekiel 1:24</a>), but the statement that the sound was heard in the outer court is strange, as the distance was not great. In Ezekiel’s day, however, the outer court had not the symmetry which he gives it in his final vision but extended to a considerable distance from the house, and may have been regarded as including the royal buildings (see the plans <span class="ital">Ency.

The hands of the "living creatures," now recognized as cherubim, had been mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a>, and it is one of those hands that gives the fire into the hands of the linen vested minister of wrath. The elemental forces of nature, of which the cherubim are, partly at least, the symbols, are working out the purposes of Jehovah. The two words translated <span class="cmt_word">wheels</span> are different in the Hebrew. The first is singular and collective (<span class="accented">galgal</span>, the "whirling thing," used of the wheel of a war chariot, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-24.htm">Ezekiel 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>), and might well be translated "chariot" here. The second, that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15, 16</a>, also in the singular, is applied to the single wheel of the four by which the angel, ministers stood. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Angels which Smite Jerusalem<p>At the call of Jehovah, His servants appear to execute the judgment. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Ezekiel 9:1</a>.

This rendering does not suit the context, since it is not the punishments that are introduced, but the men who execute them; and it is not established by the usage of the language. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; is frequently used, no doubt, in the sense of visitation or chastisement (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>); but it is not met with in the plural in this sense. In the plural it only occurs in the sense of supervision or protectorate, in which sense it occurs not only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11</a>, but also (in the singular) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>, and as early as <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-38.htm">Numbers 3:38</a>, where it relates to the presidency of the priests, and very frequently in the Chronicles. Consequently &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; are those whom God has appointed to watch over the city, the city-guard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>), - not earthly, but heavenly watchmen, - who are now to inflict punishment upon the ungodly, as the authorities appointed by God. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is an imperative Piel, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21</a>, and must not be altered into &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; (Kal), as Hitzig proposes. The Piel is used in an intransitive sense, festinanter appropinquavit, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-8.htm">Ezekiel 36:8</a>. The persons called come by the way of the upper northern gate of the temple, to take their stand before Jehovah, whose glory had appeared in the inner court. The upper gate is the gate leading from the outer court to the inner, or upper court, which stood on higher ground, - the gate mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a>. In the midst of the six men furnished with smashing-tools there was one clothed in white byssus, with writing materials at his side. The dress and equipment, as well as the instructions which he afterwards receives and executes, show him to be the prince or leader of the others.<p>Kliefoth calls in question the opinion that these seven men are angels; but without any reason. Angels appearing in human form are frequently called &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, according to their external habitus. But the number seven neither presupposes the dogma of the seven archangels, nor is copied from the seven Parsic amschaspands. The dress worn by the high priest, when presenting the sin-offering on the great day of atonement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>), was made of &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, i.e., of white material woven from byssus thread (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>). It has been inferred from this, that the figure clothed in white linen was the angel of Jehovah, who appears as the heavenly high priest, to protect and care for his own. In support of this, the circumstance may be also adduced, that the man whom Daniel saw above the water of the Tigris, and whose appearance is described, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>, in the same manner as that of Jehovah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-27</a>, and that of the risen Christ in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-15</a>, appears clothed in &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6-7</a>).<p>(Note: &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is rendered by the lxx, in the passage before us, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#837;. It is in accordance with this that Christ is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a> as clothed with a &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, and not after <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>, as Hengstenberg supposes. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>, the Septuagint has &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd; or &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;. In other places, the Sept. rendering of &#1489;&#1468;&#1491; is &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (thus <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>, etc.); and hence the &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a> answers to the &#1489;&#1468;&#1491; made of &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and is really the same as the &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>.)<p>Nevertheless, we cannot regard this view as established. The shining white talar, which is evidently meant by the plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, occurring only here and in Daniel (ut. sup.), is not a dress peculiar to the angel of Jehovah or to Christ. The seven angels, with the vials of wrath, also appear in garments of shining white linen (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a>); and the shining white colour, as a symbolical representation of divine holiness and glory (see comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>), is the colour generally chosen for the clothing both of the heavenly spirits and of "just men made perfect" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). Moreover, the angel with the writing materials here is described in a totally different manner from the appearance of Jehovah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10</a>, or that of Christ in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>; and there is nothing whatever to indicate a being equal with God. Again, the distinction between him and the other six men leads to no other conclusion, than that he stood in the same relation to them as the high priest to the Levites, or the chancellor to the other officials. This position is indicated by the writing materials on his hips, i.e., in the girdle on his hips, in which scribes in the East are accustomed to carry their writing materials (vid., Rosenmller, A. u. N. Morgenland, IV. p. 323). He is provided with these for the execution of the commission given to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a>. In this way the description can be very simply explained, without the slightest necessity for our resorting to Babylonian representations of the god Nebo, i.e., Mercury, as the scribe of heaven. The seven men take their station by the altar of burnt-offering, because the glory of God, whose commands they were about to receive, had taken up its position there for the moment (Kliefoth); not because the apostate priesthood was stationed there (Hvernick). The glory of Jehovah, however, rose up from the cherub to the threshold of the house. The meaning of this is not that it removed from the interior of the sanctuary to the outer threshold of the temple-building (Hvernick), for it was already stationed, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, above the cherub, between the porch and the altar. It went back from thence to the threshold of the temple-porch, through which one entered the Holy Place, to give its orders there. The reason for leaving its place above the cherubim (the singular &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; is used collectively) to do this, was not that "God would have had to turn round in order to address the seven from the throne, since, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, He had gone from the north gate of the outer court into the inner court, and His servants had followed Him" (Hitzig); for the cherubim moved in all four directions, and therefore God, even from the throne, could turn without difficulty to every side. God left His throne, that He might issue His command for the judgment upon Israel from the threshold of the temple, and show Himself to be the judge who would forsake the throne which He had assumed in Israel. This command He issues from the temple court, because the temple was the place whence God attested Himself to His people, both by mercy and judgment. </body></html>
