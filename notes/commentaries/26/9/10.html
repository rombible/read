He who was appointed to protect, reported the matter. Christ is faithful to the trust reposed in him. Is he commanded by his Father to secure eternal life to the chosen remnant? He says, Of all that thou hast given me, I have lost none. If others perish, and we are saved, we must ascribe the difference wholly to the mercy of our God, for we too have deserved wrath. Let us still continue to plead in behalf of others. But where the Lord shows no mercy he does no injustice; he only recompenses men's ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Left - The prophet was left alone, all who had been around him were slain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. mine eye&#8212;to show them their mistake in saying, "The Lord seeth not."<p>recompense their way upon their head&#8212;(Pr 1:31).

And He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah, which is towards the north, and behold there sat the women, weeping for Thammuz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-15.htm">Ezekiel 8:15</a>. And He said to me, Dost thou see it, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see still greater abominations than these. - The prophet is taken from the entrance into the court to the entrance of the gate of the temple, to see the women sitting there weeping for Thammuz. The article in &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is used generically. Whilst the men of the nation, represented by the seventy elders, were secretly carrying on their idolatrous worship, the women were sitting at the temple gate, and indulging in public lamentation for Thammuz. Under the weeping for Thammuz, Jerome (with Melito of Sardis and all the Greek Fathers) has correctly recognised the worship of Adonis. "&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b6; or &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;," says Jerome, "whom we have interpreted as Adonis, is called Thamuz both in Hebrew and Syriac; and because, according to the heathen legend, this lover of Venus and most beautiful youth is said to have been slain in the month of June and then restored to life again, they call this month of June by the same name, and keep an annual festival in his honour, at which he is lamented by women as though he were dead, and then afterwards celebrated in songs as having come to life again." This view has not been shaken even by the objections raised by Chwolson in his Ssaabins (II. 27. 202ff.), his relics of early Babylonian literature (p. 101), and his Tammuz and human-worship among the ancient Babylonians. For the myth of Thammuz, mentioned in the Nabataean writings as a man who was put to death by the king of Babylon, whom he had commanded to introduce the worship of the seven planets and the twelve signs of the zodiac, and who was exalted to a god after his death, and honoured with a mourning festival, is nothing more than a refined interpretation of the very ancient nature-worship which spread over the whole of Hither Asia, and in which the power of the sun over the vegetation of the year was celebrated. The etymology of the word Tammuz is doubtful. It is probably a contraction of &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, from &#1502;&#1494;&#1494;  equals  &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, so that it denotes the decay of the force of nature, and corresponds to the Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  &#787;&#x391;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (see Hvernick in loc.). </body></html>
