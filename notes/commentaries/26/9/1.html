His nature is sufficiently shown by the prophet’s address to Him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your fury on Jerusalem?">Ezekiel 9:8</a> : “Ah, Lord God!” The “loud voice” was to give emphasis to what is said; it is the natural expression of the fierceness of the Divine indignation and wrath.<p><span class= "bld">Them that have charge over the city.</span>—Not earthly officers, but those to whom God has especially entrusted the execution of His will concerning Jerusalem. The word is, no doubt, used often enough of human officers, but such sense is necessarily excluded here by the whole circumstances of the vision. Nor does the phrase “every man” at all indicate that they were human beings, the same expression being constantly used of angels (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/18-1.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;">Genesis 18:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-11.htm" title="And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man that spoke to the woman?

They appear only in the light of the administrators of vengeance, the description of them being that each had “his destroying weapon in his hand.” This is repeated in the following verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/9-1.htm" title="He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand....">Ezekiel 9:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">He cried also in mine ears — </span>Namely, the man whom he had seen upon the throne; <span class="ital">with a loud voice — </span>This denoted the terribleness of the judgments which were going to be inflicted. <span class="ital">Cause them that have charge, </span>&c. — That is, says Lowth, “the angels who had the charge of executing God’s judgments upon the city.” Or it may be intended of the Chaldean army, or of its principal leaders, who had a charge or commission against Jerusalem, to avenge the divine justice of it, because of its heinous provocations. The passage is prophetical of the slaughter which should be made of its inhabitants. <span class="ital">And behold, </span>&c. — No sooner was the command given, than these ministers of God’s displeasure appear ready to execute it. <span class="ital">Six men — </span>In the vision they appeared as men, and the prophet terms them according to their appearance. <span class="ital">From the way of the higher gate — </span>See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-14.htm" title="Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.">Ezekiel 8:14</a>. <span class="ital">Which lieth toward the north — </span>The Babylonians made their inroads into Palestine, as has been more than once observed, from the north, and by this gate it seems, the Chaldeans first entered into the city. <span class="ital">And every man a slaughter-weapon in his hand — </span>Prepared for the work to which they were called. <span class="ital">And one among them was clothed with linen — </span>A garment proper to the priesthood; and the habit in which the angels often appeared, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/12-6.htm" title="And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?...">Daniel 12:6-7</a>.

Thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-2.htm" title="And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,">Revelation 7:2</a>, St. John in a vision saw an angel with the seal of the living God, and therewith the servants of God were sealed in their foreheads; “in allusion,” says Bishop Newton, “to the ancient custom of marking servants in their foreheads, to distinguish what they were, and to whom they belonged.” The position of the inkhorn, by the side of this writer, may appear strange to a European reader, but according to Olearius, Dr. Shaw, and others, the custom of placing it by the side continues in the East to this day. <span class="ital">And they went in and stood beside the brazen altar — </span>To denote that the men ordained to destruction were offered up as so many sacrifices to God’s justice. The destruction of the wicked is elsewhere expressed by the name of a sacrifice: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm" title="And, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD; Speak to every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh, and drink blood.">Ezekiel 39:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-2.htm" title="Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be to me as Ariel.">Isaiah 29:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm" title="The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.">Isaiah 34:6</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-4 It is a great comfort to believers, that in the midst of destroyers and destructions, there is a Mediator, a great High Priest, who has an interest in heaven, and in whom saints on earth have an interest. The representation of the Divine glory from above the ark, removed to the threshold, denoted that the Lord was about to leave his mercy-seat, and to pronounce judgment on the people. The distinguishing character of this remnant that is to be saved, is such as sigh and cry to God in prayer, because of the abominations in Jerusalem. Those who keep pure in times of general wickedness, God will keep safe in times of general trouble and distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Them that have charge - The angels who have charge to execute God's sentence.<p>Every man - "angels," not "men." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Eze 9:1-11.

That is, the glory of the Lord God of Israel, whom the prophet saw in the temple, and who directed him from place to place, and showed him all the abominations committed there: this loud voice of the Lord was not so much to excite the attention of the prophet, as to call together the ministers of his vengeance; and to show the greatness of his indignation, and the vehemence of his wrath, which was stirred up by the sins of the people: <p>saying, cause them that have the charge over the city to draw near; or, <p>"who were appointed over the city,'' <p>as the Targum; that is, the city of Jerusalem; by whom are meant either the ministering angels, who had been the guardians of it, but now were to be employed another way; or the princes of the Chaldean army, who had a charge against the city to destroy it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>. The Syriac version is, "draw near, ye avengers of the city"; and the Septuagint and Arabic versions are "the vengeance of the city draws nigh": <p>even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand; weapons of war, as bows and arrows, sword and spear; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> the city to draw near, even every man <i>with</i> his destroying weapon in his hand.</span><p>(a) The time to take vengeance.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">that have charge over the city</span>] Lit. either the “oversights” (overseers), or the “visitations” (visitants) of the city. The latter is most natural, “visitations” being said for “those who visit,” that is, the executioners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm" title="Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.">Jeremiah 52:11</a>). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-17.htm" title="For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make your officers peace, and your exactors righteousness.">Isaiah 60:17</a> (officers). The verb may be rendered as A.V. Bring near, or Draw near (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-8.htm" title="But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.">Ezekiel 36:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-37.htm" title="I would declare to him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near to him.">Job 31:37</a>). The <span class="ital">perf</span>., the executioners are at hand, is less suitable to the loud cry, and the immediate appearance of the seven men seems in response to the summons.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cried,</span> etc. The voice comes, as before, from the human form, seen as a theophany, in the midst of the Divine glory. <span class="cmt_word">Cause them that have charge over the city.</span> The noun is an abstract plural, commonly rendered "visitation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-23.htm">Jeremiah 11:23</a>, and elsewhere). Here, however, it clearly stands for persons (just as we use "the watch" for "the watchmen"), and is so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11</a>). The persons addressed are called "men," but they are clearly thought of as superhuman; like the angels who came to Sodom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>); like the angel with the drawn sword in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">His destroying weapon.</span> The word clearly implies something different from a sword, but corresponds in its vagueness to the Hebrew. In ver. 2 the Hebrew for "slaughter weapon" implies an instrument for crashing into fragments, probably an axe or mace. A cognate word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a> is translated "battle axe," and the LXX. gives that meaning here, as also does the margin of the Revised Version. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>First Abomination-Picture<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now towards the north. And I lifted up my eyes towards the north, and, behold, to the north of the gate of the altar was this image of jealousy at the entrance. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? great abominations, which the house of Israel doeth here, that I may go far away from my sanctuary; and thou shalt yet again see greater abominations still. - As Ezekiel had taken his stand in the inner court at the entrance of the north gate, and when looking thence towards the north saw the image of jealousy to the north of the altar gate, the image must have stood on the outer side of the entrance, so that the prophet saw it as he looked through the open doorway. The altar gate is the same as the northern gate of the inner court mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3.htm">Ezekiel 3</a>. But it is impossible to state with certainty how it came to be called the altar gate. Possibly from the circumstance that the sacrificial animals were taken through this gate to the altar, to be slaughtered on the northern side of the altar, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11</a>, etc. &#1502;&#1492;&#1501;, contracted from &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1492;&#1501;, like &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; from &#1502;&#1492; &#1494;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2</a>. The words "what they are doing here" do not force us to assume that at that very time they were worshipping the idol. They simply describe what was generally practised there. The setting up of the image involved the worship of it. The subject to &#1500;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1492; is not the house of Israel, but Jehovah. They perform great abominations, so that Jehovah is compelled to go to a distance from His sanctuary, i.e., to forsake it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>), because they make it an idol-temple. </body></html>
