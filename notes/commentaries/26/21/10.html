There is, however, serious difficulty as to the construction and meaning of the clause. The ancient versions and many commentators have more or less changed the text without improvement. The original is obscure in its extreme brevity, and allows “the rod of my son” to be either the object (as it is taken in the text) or the subject (as in the margin). The true sense is probably that which makes the clause into an objection offered <span class= "ital">by </span>the Jew to the prophet’s denunciation: “But ‘the rod of my son’ despiseth every tree;” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Divine promise of old to Judah is sure, and his sceptre must remain whatever power arises against it. The objection was in a certain sense true, but the objectors had little idea of the means by which its truth should be established, and vainly imagined that it gave a temporal security to the kingdom of Judah, whatever might be its sins. The prophet does not notice the objection further than to go on with his prediction of the approaching desolation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-17 Here is an explanation of the parable in the last chapter. It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord.

To cut easily, and wound deeply, and make a slaughter of men, like beasts for sacrifice; a sacrifice to the justice of God for their sins, and so acceptable to him; and it is he indeed that sharpens it, or prepares the instruments of his vengeance, whether Chaldeans, or Romans, or both; and gives them might and courage to execute his will with great keenness of wrath and fury: <p>it is furbished that it may glitter; and so strike terror on those against whom it is drawn, and for whom it is prepared, as glittering armour does: <p>should we then make mirth? sing, and dance, and feast, and indulge ourselves in all kind of mirth and jollity, when this is the case, a drawn, sharp, glittering sword hangs over our heads? no, surely! there is good reason for you to lament and sigh, as I do; you ask me the reason of it, this is it; is there not a cause? there is; it is not a season for mirth; but for weeping and lamentation. The words may be rendered, "or let us rejoice" (r); that is, if we can, ironically spoken. <p>It contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree; thus says the Lord God, this sword so sharpened and brightened despises the rod or sceptre (for so the word signifies) of Israel my son, my firstborn, and makes no more of it than a common stick, and cuts it to pieces, and destroys it; signifying hereby the easy destruction of the sceptre and kingdom of Judah by the sword of the Chaldeans or Romans. Some understand it of Christ the Son of God. The words may be rendered, "it is the rod of my son, it despiseth every tree" (s); this sword, prepared, is no other than the rod of iron, which the Son of God makes use of to rule his enemies with, and break them in pieces; and no tree, high and low, can stand before it; it cuts down all, and destroys them, be they what they will; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>.

These words with the rest to the end of the verse appear to have little meaning in the connexion. R V. renders the whole: “shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree.” This is a literal rendering, the last words meaning probably that the rod (the sword of Babylon) with which Jehovah now chastises his son (the prince, or, people) contemneth (exceeds in severity) every tree, or, all wood, i.e. all rods of chastisement which are mere wood, for it is glittering steel. Some ingenuity is needed to extract the meaning, which, however, when extracted is difficult to harmonise with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-13.htm" title="Because it is a trial, and what if the sword scorn even the rod? it shall be no more, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 21:13</a></span>. The words “shall we then make mirth?” still appear meaningless. For “or” or “then” Frd. Del. would find some cohortative particle after the Assyr.,—ha! let us make mirth! the words being those of God (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-17.htm" title="I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.">Ezekiel 21:17</a></span>), and the following words “contemneth every tree” meaning that in comparison with the rod he now uses all other rods of chastisement are only despicable, and useless for their purpose (<span class="ital">Zeit. f. Keilschritftforschung</span>, ii. 4 p. 385). The text appears to be in disorder, and though many emendations have been proposed none of them is satisfactory. Ges., … “glitter, against the prince of the tribe of my son (Judah), which despiseth all wood”—<span class="ital">prince</span> for “should we rejoice” (nasi’ for nasis), and the idea being expressed that as Judah has hitherto despised all ordinary chastisements with the rod of wood the sword shall now be drawn against the prince. Ew., “no weak rod of my son, the softest of all wood”—the words “rod of my son” being a phrase from the mouth of fathers and meaning a gentle rod. Apart from the unnatural constructions and the strong Aramaisms assumed, the sense is feeble and improbable. Smend, “woe O prince! thou hast despised the rod, contemned every tree (all wood)”—rod and wood being used of chastening as before. LXX. reads: “ready (= furbished) for paralysing (enfeebling); slay, despise, set at nought every tree”! The imperatives are addressed to the sword. The words “for paralysing” may be a rendering of present Heb. read with Aramean sense; but “for” is read for “or.” It is by no means certain that LXX. <span class="ital">found</span> imperatives, because it renders <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-9.htm" title="Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus said the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:">Ezekiel 21:9</a></span> also in the imperative. Partly following Sep. Corn., “for men who slay and plunder (lit. men of slaughter and plundering) who despise every stronghold”—viz. the Chaldeans, into whose hand the sword of the Lord is to be given. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm" title="The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases: he has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he regards no man.">Isaiah 33:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-10.htm" title="And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.">Habakkuk 1:10</a>.) This really gives a meaning, though it is gained at considerable cost, for some of the words assumed do not occur, the constructions are far from probable, and the changes of the text are serious. Further, in all the passage it is the sword itself that is dwelt upon and those whom it shall slay; those who are to wield it are only alluded to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Scholars almost unanimously assume that there is ref. in the clause to former chastisement, hence “rod” and “all wood” are read in that sense. But such an idea seems little in place in the connexion; and the word rendered “rod” may mean sceptre or almost ruler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-11.htm" title="And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.">Ezekiel 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm" title="And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which has devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.">Ezekiel 19:14</a>), and “every tree” may be taken of other sceptres. The assumption that “contemneth every tree” (all wood) means: exceeds in severity of punishment every rod, or looks down on every other chastening rod, feeling its own superiority as an instrument of punishment, is a very far-fetched one. It is certainly possible that the word “prince” (princes) lurks in the strange “shall we then rejoice?” (Ges. Sm.). The prince and royal house are alluded to repeatedly in the chapter, e.g. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-14.htm" title="You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite your hands together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which enters into their privy chambers.">Ezekiel 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/21-25.htm" title="And you, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,...">Ezekiel 21:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-29.htm" title="Whiles they see vanity to you, whiles they divine a lie to you, to bring you on the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.">Ezekiel 21:29</a></span>. The rendering: “against the prince (princes), the sceptre of my son (that) despiseth all wood” (i.e. other sceptres, or royal powers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-11.htm" title="And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.">Ezekiel 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm" title="And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which has devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.">Ezekiel 19:14</a>), is not very natural. The expression “my son,” whether applied to the king or the people, has something unexpected about it in Ezek., though “my people” is used in the passage also (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-12.htm" title="Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be on my people, it shall be on all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be on my people: smite therefore on your thigh.">Ezekiel 21:12</a></span>), and an undertone of pity, or at least a deep feeling of the terribleness of the coming calamity, runs through the passage. The words “shall we then make mirth?” can hardly stand in any case, even in this form: “or shall we make mirth (saying), The sceptre of my son contemneth all wood!” i.e. defies every other sceptre or royal power (<span class="ital">La Bible Annotéc</span>). Any reference in the passage to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm" title="Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?">Genesis 49:9</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm" title="I will be his father, and he shall be my son.

They need not dread the sword, they say, because the sceptre of the house of David, whom Jehovah recognizes as his son, despises all wood, looks on every other rod that is the symbol of sovereignty, with scorn. It is urged, in favour of this interpretation, that ver. 27 contains an unmistakable refer, nee to the prophetic words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald: <span class="accented">It is no weak rod of my son, the softest of all wood</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sword of Jehovah is no weak weapon such as might be used for the chastisement of a child (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hengstenberg: <span class="accented">Shall we rejoice over the rod of my son, despising every tree?</span> There is no cause for anything but the reverse of joy in the rod, the punishment which God appoints for Israel as his son, and which surpasses all others in its severity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The Authorized Version and Revised Version (margin) make the "sword" the nominative, and the words are those of Jehovah: <span class="accented">It contemneth the rod</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sceptre) <span class="accented">of my son, as it contemns every other tree</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-4.htm">Ezekiel 20:4</a>), <span class="accented">every other national sovereignty</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The Revised.

And I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! they say of me, Does he not speak in parables? - The prophet is to turn his face toward the south, and prophesy concerning the forest of the field there. &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507; is used for prophesying, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-16.htm">Amos 7:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>. The distinction between the three epithets applied to the south is the following: &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503; is literally that which lies on the right hand, hence the south is a particular quarter of the heavens; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, which only occurs in Ezekiel and Ecclesiastes, with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-17.htm">Job 37:17</a>, is derived from &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, to shine or emit streams of light, and probably signifies the brilliant quarter; &#1504;&#1490;&#1489;, the dry, parched land, is a standing epithet for the southern district of Palestine and the land of Judah (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>). - The forest of the field in the south is a figure denoting the kingdom of Judah (&#1504;&#1490;&#1489; is in apposition to &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, and is appended to it as a more precise definition). &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; is not used here for a field, as distinguished from a city or a garden; but for the fields in the sense of country or territory, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a>, &#1497;&#1506;&#1512; , forest of the south land, is the expression applied to the same object (&#1492;&#1504;&#1490;&#1489;, with the article, is a geographical term for the southern portion of Palestine). The forest is a figure signifying the population, or the mass of people. Individual men are trees. The green tree is a figurative representation of the righteous man, and the dry tree of the ungodly (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-31.htm">Luke 23:31</a>). The fire which Jehovah kindles is the fire of war. The combination of the synonyms &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;, flame of the flaming brightness, serves to strengthen the expression, and is equivalent to the strongest possible flame, the blazing fire. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, all faces are not human faces or persons, in which case the prophet would have dropped the figure; but pa&#770;nim denotes generally the outside of things, which is the first to feel the force of the flame. "All the faces" of the forest are every single thing in the forest, which is caught at once by the flame. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-4.htm">Ezekiel 21:4</a>, ko&#774;l-pa&#770;nim (all faces) is interpreted by ko&#774;l&#775;-ba&#770;sar (all flesh). From south to north, i.e., through the whole length of the land. From the terrible fierceness of the fire, which cannot be extinguished, every one will know that God has kindled it, that it has been sent in judgment. The words of the prophet himself, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>, presuppose that he has uttered these parabolic words in the hearing of the people, and that they have ridiculed them as obscure (ma&#770;sha&#770;l is used here in the sense of obscure language, words difficult to understand, as &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; also is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10</a>).
