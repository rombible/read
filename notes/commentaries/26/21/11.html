It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is in earnest in pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree - The rod is the scepter of dominion, assigned to Judah <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. The destroying sword of Babylon despises the scepter of Judah; it despises every tree. Others render the verse, "Shall we make mirth" (saying), "the rod of my son," (the rod which corrects my people) "contemneth" (treats with scorn, utterly confounds) "every tree" (every other nation); or, the scepter of my people "contemneth" (proudly despises) every other nation.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-46.htm">Ezekiel 20:46</a>. Son of man, direct thy face toward the south, and trickle down towards the south, and prophesy concerning the forest of the field in the south land; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a>. And say to the forest of the south land, Hear the word of Jehovah; Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I kindle a fire in thee, which will consume in thee every green tree, and every dry tree: the blazing flame will not be extinguished, and all faces from the south to the north will be burned thereby. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-48.htm">Ezekiel 20:48</a>. And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it: it shall not be extinguished. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>. And I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! they say of me, Does he not speak in parables? - The prophet is to turn his face toward the south, and prophesy concerning the forest of the field there. &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507; is used for prophesying, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-16.htm">Amos 7:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>. The distinction between the three epithets applied to the south is the following: &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503; is literally that which lies on the right hand, hence the south is a particular quarter of the heavens; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, which only occurs in Ezekiel and Ecclesiastes, with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-17.htm">Job 37:17</a>, is derived from &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, to shine or emit streams of light, and probably signifies the brilliant quarter; &#1504;&#1490;&#1489;, the dry, parched land, is a standing epithet for the southern district of Palestine and the land of Judah (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>). - The forest of the field in the south is a figure denoting the kingdom of Judah (&#1504;&#1490;&#1489; is in apposition to &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, and is appended to it as a more precise definition). &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; is not used here for a field, as distinguished from a city or a garden; but for the fields in the sense of country or territory, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a>, &#1497;&#1506;&#1512; , forest of the south land, is the expression applied to the same object (&#1492;&#1504;&#1490;&#1489;, with the article, is a geographical term for the southern portion of Palestine). The forest is a figure signifying the population, or the mass of people. Individual men are trees. The green tree is a figurative representation of the righteous man, and the dry tree of the ungodly (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-31.htm">Luke 23:31</a>). The fire which Jehovah kindles is the fire of war. The combination of the synonyms &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;, flame of the flaming brightness, serves to strengthen the expression, and is equivalent to the strongest possible flame, the blazing fire. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, all faces are not human faces or persons, in which case the prophet would have dropped the figure; but pa&#770;nim denotes generally the outside of things, which is the first to feel the force of the flame. "All the faces" of the forest are every single thing in the forest, which is caught at once by the flame. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-4.htm">Ezekiel 21:4</a>, ko&#774;l-pa&#770;nim (all faces) is interpreted by ko&#774;l&#775;-ba&#770;sar (all flesh). From south to north, i.e., through the whole length of the land. From the terrible fierceness of the fire, which cannot be extinguished, every one will know that God has kindled it, that it has been sent in judgment. The words of the prophet himself, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>, presuppose that he has uttered these parabolic words in the hearing of the people, and that they have ridiculed them as obscure (ma&#770;sha&#770;l is used here in the sense of obscure language, words difficult to understand, as &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; also is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10</a>). At the same time, it contains within itself request that they may be explained. This request is granted; and the simile is first of all interpreted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1-7</a>, and then still further expanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-8.htm">Ezekiel 21:8</a>. </body></html>
