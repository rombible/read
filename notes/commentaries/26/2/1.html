It is not said who it was that spoke, but the “He” in connection with the vision before him could be none other than the Most High, whose glory that vision was given to reveal. The phrase “son of man” is common enough throughout the Scriptures, as meaning simply <span class= "ital">man, </span>but is never used in an address to a prophet, except to Ezekiel and Daniel. To Daniel it is used only once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a>), while to Ezekiel it is used above ninety times. The reason is, doubtless, that since he was the prophet of the captivity he was addressed in the common terms of the language where he lived. “Son of man” for “man” is so common in the Aramaic languages that it is even used of Adam himself in the Syriac version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1Corinthians 15:45-47</a>. The address to Ezekiel here as “man,” just as under similar circumstances to Daniel when he had fallen upon his face through awe of the supernatural presence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a>), is doubtless in compassion to his weakness. And then comes the strengthening command, “Stand upon thy feet,” that he may be able to receive the communication God is about to make to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/2-1.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you....">Ezekiel 2:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he — </span>Who sat upon the throne, the Son of God, whose messenger Ezekiel is here appointed to be to the Jewish captives now in Chaldea; <span class="ital">said unto me, Son of man — </span>A title ninety-five times, at least, given to Ezekiel, in this prophecy, in order, as most commentators suppose, to put him in mind of his frailty and mortality, and to keep him humble, amidst so many divine visions and revelations vouchsafed him from God: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm" title="What is man, that you are mindful of him? and the son of man, that you visit him?">Psalm 8:4</a>. <span class="ital">Stand upon thy feet — </span>Arise, fear not, and put thyself into a posture of attending to what I shall say to thee.

As Christ usually called himself the Son of man, it was also an honourable distinction. Ezekiel's posture showed reverence, but his standing up would be a posture of greater readiness and fitness for business. God will speak to us, when we stand ready to do what he commands us. As Ezekiel had not strength of his own, the Spirit entered into him. God is graciously pleased to work in us whatever he requires of us. The Holy Spirit sets us upon our feet, by inclining our wills to our duty. Thus, when the Lord calls upon the sinner to awake, and attend to the concerns of his soul, the Spirit of life and grace comes with the call. Ezekiel is sent with a message to the children of Israel. Many might treat his message with contempt, yet they should know by the event that a prophet had been sent to them. God will be glorified, and his word made honourable, whether it be a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Son of man - This phrase (which occurs elsewhere in Scripture) is applied especially to Ezekiel and Daniel, the prophets of the captivity. Ezekiel is thus reminded of his humanity, at the time when he is especially permitted to have contact with God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Eze 2:1-10. Ezekiel's Commission.<p>1. Son of man&#8212;often applied to Ezekiel; once only to Daniel (Da 8:17), and not to any other prophet. The phrase was no doubt taken from Chaldean usage during the sojourn of Daniel and Ezekiel in Chaldea. But the spirit who sanctioned the words of the prophet implied by it the lowliness and frailty of the prophet as man "lower than the angels," though now admitted to the vision of angels and of God Himself, "lest he should be exalted through the abundance of the revelations" (2Co 12:7). He is appropriately so called as being type of the divine "Son of man" here revealed as "man" (see on [1018]Eze 1:26). That title, as applied to Messiah, implies at once His lowliness and His exaltation, in His manifestations as the Representative man, at His first and second comings respectively (Ps 8:4-8; Mt 16:13; 20:18; and on the other hand, Da 7:13, 14; Mt 26:64; Joh 5:27).Ezekiel’s commission, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/2-1.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you....">Ezekiel 2:1-5</a></span>; his instructions, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house....">Ezekiel 2:6-8</a></span>.

The glorious Person who sat upon the throne, whose appearance is described in the latter part of the preceding chapter: <p>son of man; as he was to be that spake unto him; and so it may denote relation, affection, and familiarity; or otherwise it is expressive of humiliation; of the frail, mean, and low estate of man, through the fall, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>; wherefore some think Ezekiel is thus addressed, lest he should be lifted up, and think himself as one of the angels, because he had seen so great a vision; just as the Apostle Paul was humbled, lest he should be exalted above measure, through the visions and revelations he had, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>. Kimchi mentions this, but assigns another reason; that because he saw the face of a man in the above vision, he let him know that he was right and good in the eye of God; and was the son of man, and not the son of a lion, &amp;c. which is exceeding weak and trifling. Abendana, besides these, mentions some other reasons given; as that because he saw the "mercavah" or chariot, and ascended to the dignity of the angels on high, it is as if it was said, there is none born of a woman, as this; or because he was carried out of the holy land, as Adam was drove out of Eden; and therefore called the son of the first Adam, being drove out of Jerusalem, and out of the temple, where he was a priest. It may be observed, that this is a name which our Lord frequently took to himself in his state of humiliation; and that none but Ezekiel, excepting once the Prophet Daniel, is called by this name; and no doubt the reason of it is, because he was an eminent type of Christ; and particularly in his mission and commission, as a prophet, to the rebellious house of Israel: <p>stand upon thy feet; for he was fallen upon his face, at the sight of the vision, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>; when a divine Person speaks, men ought to stand and hear, and be in a readiness to do his pleasure: <p>and I will speak unto thee; which is said for his encouragement, being spoken by him who has the words of truth and grace, and of eternal life. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> he said to me, <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.</span><p>(a) That is, the Lord.<p>(b) Meaning, man who is but earth and ashes, which was to humble him, and cause him to consider his own state, and God's grace.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1–7</span>.

This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). He is bidden stand on his feet. Not paralysis before him is desired by God, but reasonable service. The prophet’s falling down was natural, yet a condition unfit for God’s purposes, and not desired by him to continue. Those whom he calls to his service are his fellow-workers, who may look upon his face. It is man erect, man in his manhood, with whom God will have fellowship and with whom he will speak—stand upon thy feet “that I may speak with thee.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Son of man,</span> etc. It is noticeable that the phrase (<span class="accented">ben adam</span>), as addressed to a prophet, occurs only in Ezekiel, in whom we find it not less than eighty times, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>. As used elsewhere, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>, and in Ezekiel's use of it, it is probably connected with the history of Adam, as created from the ground (<span class="accented">adamah</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>. The prophet is reminded, in the very moment of his highest inspiration, of his Adam nature with all its infirmity and limitations. In the use of a like phrase (<span class="accented">bar enosh</span>, instead of <span class="accented">ben adam</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> we have the same truth implied. There one like unto man in all things is called to share the sovereignty of the "Ancient of Days," the Eternal One. Here the prophet, nothing in himself, is called to be the messenger of God to other sons of men. It is in many ways suggestive that our Lord should have chosen the same formula for constant use when speaking of himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, and <span class="accented">passim</span> in the Gospels). <span class="cmt_word">Stand upon thy feet.</span> The attitude of adoration is changed, by the Divine command, into that of expectant service, that of awe and dread for the courage of a soldier of the Lord of hosts (compare the parallels of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>). </body></html>
