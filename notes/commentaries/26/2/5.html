God’s word remains the same whatever reception man may accord to it; it cannot return unto Him void, but must accomplish that which He pleases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm" title="So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.">Isaiah 55:11</a>); just as the Apostles remained “unto God a sweet savour of Christ” alike “in them that are saved and in them that perish” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/2-15.htm" title="For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:">2Corinthians 2:15-16</a>). But while the mighty power of the Divine word must thus produce its effect, the character of the effect depends upon those to whom it comes; “to the one we are a savour of death unto death, and to the other the savour of life unto life.” So it would be among the captives by the Chebar: some would be brought back to their allegiance to their God, and would constitute the remnant through whom He would bless His people and the world; and some, resisting the offered grace, would be thus made more obdurate than ever. In either case, they could not remain as before. Whether for gain or for loss, they should “know that there hath been a prophet among them,” by the change his ministrations should produce among them. The offer of grace, imposing the responsibility of accepting or rejecting it, ever becomes thus “a great and terrible day of the Lord.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-31.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.">Joel 2:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-12.htm" title="But I say to you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they listed.

As Christ usually called himself the Son of man, it was also an honourable distinction. Ezekiel's posture showed reverence, but his standing up would be a posture of greater readiness and fitness for business. God will speak to us, when we stand ready to do what he commands us. As Ezekiel had not strength of his own, the Spirit entered into him. God is graciously pleased to work in us whatever he requires of us. The Holy Spirit sets us upon our feet, by inclining our wills to our duty. Thus, when the Lord calls upon the sinner to awake, and attend to the concerns of his soul, the Spirit of life and grace comes with the call. Ezekiel is sent with a message to the children of Israel. Many might treat his message with contempt, yet they should know by the event that a prophet had been sent to them. God will be glorified, and his word made honourable, whether it be a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A rebellious house - A phrase employed continually by Ezekiel in bitter irony, in the place of house of Israel, as much as to say, "House no longer of Israel, but of rebellion."

Or "cease" (y); that is, from hearing, as Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it; or from sinning, as the Targum. The sense is, whether they would hear the word of the Lord, as spoken by the prophet, attend unto it, receive it, and obey it; or whether they would reject it, turn their backs on it, and discontinue hearing it; or whether they would so hear as to leave their sinful course of life, or not: this the prophet could not know beforehand, nor should he be concerned about it, or be discouraged if his ministry should be fruitless; since he could not expect much from them: <p>(for they are a rebellious house); or, "a house of rebellion" (z); a most rebellious one; hard of heart, face, and neck: <p>yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them; so that they were left without excuse, which was the end of the prophet's being sent unto them; there was little or no hope of reclaiming them; but, however, by such a step taken, they could not say that they had no prophet sent to reprove them for their sins, and warn them of their danger; had they, they would have listened to him, and so have escaped the evils that came upon them, <p>(y) "cessaverint", Pagninas, Montanus, Starckius; "desistent", Calvin, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

The future shall bring this home to them. They shall see the prophet’s words come to pass, and shall know that a true messenger from the Lord spoke to them. The true prophet, the man who has anything to announce from God, may assure himself that, however he be received when he speaks, in the long run he shall receive his due and be recognized for what he was.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,</span> etc. The latter word is used in the sense of "cease" or "desist," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>. The same formula meets us in ver. 7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11, 27</a>. The prophet is warned beforehand of the (at least) probable failure of his mission, wholly or in part. We note the parallelism of thought, though not language, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15, 16</a>. Such, at all times, has been the condition of the prophet's work. The expectation is grounded upon the antecedent fact of their being a "rebellious people." There is the consolation that in the end, partly through the fulfilment of his words, partly, it may be, through the witness of their own conscience, they shall know that there has been a prophet among them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-9.htm">Jeremiah 28:9</a>). We note that it is the first time that Ezekiel claims that name for himself. </body></html>
