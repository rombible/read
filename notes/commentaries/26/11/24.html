It was from the Mount of Olives that the vision went up, typifying the ascension of Christ to heaven from that very mountain.

The rabbis commenting on this passage said the Shechinah retired to this Mount, and there for three years called in vain to the people with human voice that they should repent. On that mountain, Christ stood, when He wept over the fair city so soon to be utterly destroyed. From that mountain he descended, amid loud Hosannas, to enter the city and temple as a Judge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. brought me in a vision&#8212;not in actual fact, but in ecstatic vision.

It was a vision from heaven, all that was represented to the prophet was as it were let down from heaven, and he having fully viewed it, it is taken up again to heaven. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Afterwards the spirit took me up,.... From the east gate of the temple, whither he had brought him; when he had been shown, and everything had been told him, necessary for the reproof of the Jews in Jerusalem, and for the comfort of the captives: <p>and brought me in vision by the spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity; all this was done in vision; so it appeared to the prophet, under the influence of the divine Spirit of God, as if he was carried to Jerusalem, and there saw and heard all he did, and then was brought back again to Chaldea; whereas this was only mental, not corporeal; he was all the while in Chaldea, though things were so represented to his mind as if he had been removed from place to place: <p>so the vision that I had seen went up from me; he returned to himself, and became as another man, or as he was before; and found himself in his own house, and among the elders of Judah This shows that the vision was from heaven, and therefore it is said to go up from him; and that prophecy was not of the will of men, but of God; and that the prophets were not always under the influence of a prophetic spirit; but this came and went, and was only with them at certain times. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.

Ye have increased your slain in this city, and filled its streets with slain. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm">Ezekiel 11:7</a>.

And ye shall learn that I am Jehovah, in whose statutes ye have not walked, and my judgments ye have not done, but have acted according to the judgments of the heathen who are round about you. - For &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; , compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>. Instead of the "hand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>), the Spirit of Jehovah is mentioned here; because what follows is simply a divine inspiration, and there is no action connected with it. The words of God are directed against the "house of Israel,' whose words and thoughts are discerned by God, because the twenty-five men are the leaders and counsellors of the nation. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, thoughts, suggestions of the mind, may be explained from the phrase &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1489;, to come into the mind. Their actions furnish the proof of the evil suggestions of their heart. They have filled the city with slain; not "turned the streets of the city into a battle-field," however, by bringing about the capture of Jerusalem in the time of Jeconiah, as Hitzig would explain it. The words are to be understood in a much more general sense, as signifying murder, in both the coarser and the more refined signification of the word.<p>(Note: Calvin has given the correct explanation, thus: "He does not mean that men had been openly assassinated in the streets of Jerusalem; but under this form of speech he embraces all kinds of injustice. For we know that all who oppressed the poor, deprived men of their possessions, or shed innocent blood, were regarded as murderers in the sight of God.")<p>&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; is a copyist's error for &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;. Those who have been murdered by you are the flesh in the caldron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm">Ezekiel 11:7</a>). Ezekiel gives them back their own words, as words which contain an undoubted truth, but in a different sense from that in which they have used them. By their bloodshed they have made the city into a pot in which the flesh of the slain is pickled. Only in this sense is Jerusalem a pot for them; not a pot to protect the flesh from burning while cooking, but a pot into which the flesh of the slaughtered is thrown. Yet even in this sense will Jerusalem not serve as a pot to these worthless counsellors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-11.htm">Ezekiel 11:11</a>). They will lead you out of the city (&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm">Ezekiel 11:7</a>, is the 3rd pers. sing. with an indefinite subject). The sword which ye fear, and from which this city is to protect you, will come upon you, and cut you down - not in Jerusalem, but on the frontier of Israel. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-10.htm">Ezekiel 11:10</a>, cannot be taken in the sense of "away over the frontier," as Kliefoth proposes; if only because of the synonym &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-11.htm">Ezekiel 11:11</a>. This threat was literally fulfilled in the bloody scenes at Riblah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24-27</a>). It is not therefore a vaticinium ex eventu, but contains the general thought, that the wicked who boasted of security in Jerusalem or in the land of Israel as a whole, but were to be led out of the land, and judged outside. This threat intensifies the punishment, as Calvin has already shown.<p>(Note: "He threatens a double punishment; first, that God will cast them out of Jerusalem, in which they delight, and where they say that they will still make their abode for a long time to come, so that exile may be the first punishment. He then adds, secondly, that He will not be content with exile, but will send a severer punishment, after they have been cast out, and both home and land have spued them out as a stench which they could not bear. I will judge you at the frontier of Israel, i.e., outside the holy land, so that when one curse shall have become manifest in exile, a severer and more formidable punishment shall still await you.")<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-11.htm">Ezekiel 11:11</a> the negation (&#1500;&#1488;) of the first clause is to be supplied in the second, as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-12.htm">Ezekiel 11:12</a>, compare the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-7.htm">Ezekiel 5:7</a>. The truth and the power of this word are demonstrated at once by what is related in the following verse. </body></html>
