It has never been promised that all men shall be brought to a true sense of their relations to God, for human responsibility, and consequently power of choice, is not removed; but God’s grace is never in vain, and if it does not lead to blessing through its acceptance, must result in greater condemnation through its rejection.

It is promised, that God will give them one heart; a heart firmly fixed for God, and not wavering. All who are made holy have a new spirit, a new temper and dispositions; they act from new principles, walk by new rules, and aim at new ends. A new name, or a new face, will not serve without a new spirit. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. The carnal heart, like a stone, cannot be made to feel. Men live among the dead and dying, and are neither concerned nor humbled. He will make their hearts tender and fit to receive impressions: this is God's work, it is his gift by promise; and a wonderful and happy change is wrought by it, from death to life. Their practices shall be agreeable to those principles. These two must and will go together. When the sinner feels his need of these blessings, let him present the promises as prayers in the name of Christ, they will be performed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>.

For those who did this, whether in Jerusalem or among the exiles, there was the prospect of a righteous retribution. The words close the message which Ezekiel heard in the courts of the temple in his visions, but which he was to deliver (ver. 25) to them of the Captivity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and said to me: Say, Thus saith Jehovah, So ye say, O house of Israel, and what riseth up in your spirit, that I know. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-6.htm">Ezekiel 11:6</a>.

It shall not be as a pot to you, so that you should be flesh therein: on the frontier of Israel shall I judge. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-12.htm">Ezekiel 11:12</a>. And ye shall learn that I am Jehovah, in whose statutes ye have not walked, and my judgments ye have not done, but have acted according to the judgments of the heathen who are round about you. - For &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; , compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>. Instead of the "hand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>), the Spirit of Jehovah is mentioned here; because what follows is simply a divine inspiration, and there is no action connected with it. The words of God are directed against the "house of Israel,' whose words and thoughts are discerned by God, because the twenty-five men are the leaders and counsellors of the nation. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, thoughts, suggestions of the mind, may be explained from the phrase &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1489;, to come into the mind. Their actions furnish the proof of the evil suggestions of their heart. They have filled the city with slain; not "turned the streets of the city into a battle-field," however, by bringing about the capture of Jerusalem in the time of Jeconiah, as Hitzig would explain it. The words are to be understood in a much more general sense, as signifying murder, in both the coarser and the more refined signification of the word.<p>(Note: Calvin has given the correct explanation, thus: "He does not mean that men had been openly assassinated in the streets of Jerusalem; but under this form of speech he embraces all kinds of injustice. For we know that all who oppressed the poor, deprived men of their possessions, or shed innocent blood, were regarded as murderers in the sight of God.")<p>&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; is a copyist's error for &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;. Those who have been murdered by you are the flesh in the caldron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm">Ezekiel 11:7</a>). Ezekiel gives them back their own words, as words which contain an undoubted truth, but in a different sense from that in which they have used them. By their bloodshed they have made the city into a pot in which the flesh of the slain is pickled. Only in this sense is Jerusalem a pot for them; not a pot to protect the flesh from burning while cooking, but a pot into which the flesh of the slaughtered is thrown. Yet even in this sense will Jerusalem not serve as a pot to these worthless counsellors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-11.htm">Ezekiel 11:11</a>). They will lead you out of the city (&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm">Ezekiel 11:7</a>, is the 3rd pers. sing. with an indefinite subject). The sword which ye fear, and from which this city is to protect you, will come upon you, and cut you down - not in Jerusalem, but on the frontier of Israel. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-10.htm">Ezekiel 11:10</a>, cannot be taken in the sense of "away over the frontier," as Kliefoth proposes; if only because of the synonym &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-11.htm">Ezekiel 11:11</a>. This threat was literally fulfilled in the bloody scenes at Riblah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24-27</a>). It is not therefore a vaticinium ex eventu, but contains the general thought, that the wicked who boasted of security in Jerusalem or in the land of Israel as a whole, but were to be led out of the land, and judged outside. This threat intensifies the punishment, as Calvin has already shown.<p>(Note: "He threatens a double punishment; first, that God will cast them out of Jerusalem, in which they delight, and where they say that they will still make their abode for a long time to come, so that exile may be the first punishment. He then adds, secondly, that He will not be content with exile, but will send a severer punishment, after they have been cast out, and both home and land have spued them out as a stench which they could not bear. I will judge you at the frontier of Israel, i.e., outside the holy land, so that when one curse shall have become manifest in exile, a severer and more formidable punishment shall still await you.")<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-11.htm">Ezekiel 11:11</a> the negation (&#1500;&#1488;) of the first clause is to be supplied in the second, as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-12.htm">Ezekiel 11:12</a>, compare the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-7.htm">Ezekiel 5:7</a>. The truth and the power of this word are demonstrated at once by what is related in the following verse. </body></html>
