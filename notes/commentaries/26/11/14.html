It is promised, that God will give them one heart; a heart firmly fixed for God, and not wavering. All who are made holy have a new spirit, a new temper and dispositions; they act from new principles, walk by new rules, and aim at new ends. A new name, or a new face, will not serve without a new spirit. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. The carnal heart, like a stone, cannot be made to feel. Men live among the dead and dying, and are neither concerned nor humbled. He will make their hearts tender and fit to receive impressions: this is God's work, it is his gift by promise; and a wonderful and happy change is wrought by it, from death to life. Their practices shall be agreeable to those principles. These two must and will go together. When the sinner feels his need of these blessings, let him present the promises as prayers in the name of Christ, they will be performed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The death of Pelatiah was communicated in this vision, which represented ideally the idolatry in which Pelatiah had actually been foremost. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

And a wind lifted me up, and took me to the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah, which faces towards the east; and behold, at the entrance of the gate were five and twenty men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the chiefs of the nation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-2.htm">Ezekiel 11:2</a>. And he said to me: Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and counsel evil counsel in this city; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>. Who say, It is not near to build houses; it is the pot, and we are the flesh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-4.htm">Ezekiel 11:4</a>. Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man. - Ezekiel is once more transported from the inner court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>) to the outer entrance of the eastern gate of the temple (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>), to which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>, the vision of God had removed. There he sees twenty-five men, and among them two of the princes of the nation, whose names are given. These twenty-five men are not identical with the twenty-five priests mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, as Hvernick supposes. This is evident, not only from the difference in the locality, the priests standing between the porch and the altar, whereas the men referred to here stood at the outer eastern entrance to the court of the temple, but from the fact that the two who are mentioned by name are called &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; (princes of the people), so that we may probably infer from this that all the twenty-five were secular chiefs. Hvernick's opinion, that &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; is a term that may also be applied to princes among the priests, is as erroneous as his assertion that the priest-princes are called "princes" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-20.htm">Ezra 8:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-1.htm">Nehemiah 10:1</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>, whereas it is only to national princes that these passages refer. Hvernick is equally incorrect in supposing that these twenty-five men take the place of the seventy mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a>; for those seventy represented the whole of the nation, whereas these twenty-five (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-2.htm">Ezekiel 11:2</a>) were simply the counsellors of the city - not, however, the twenty-four duces of twenty-four divisions of the city, with a prince of the house of Judah, as Prado maintains, on the strength of certain Rabbinical assertions; or twenty-four members of a Sanhedrim, with their president (Rosenmller); but the twelve tribe-princes (princes of the nation) and the twelve royal officers, or military commanders (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27.htm">1 Chronicles 27</a>), with the king himself, or possibly with the commander-in-chief of the army; so that these twenty-five men represent the civil government of Israel, just as the twenty-four priest-princes, together with the high priest, represent the spiritual authorities of the covenant nation. The reason why two are specially mentioned by name is involved in obscurity, as nothing further is known of either of these persons. The words of God to the prophet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-2.htm">Ezekiel 11:2</a> concerning them are perfectly applicable to representatives of the civil authorities or temporal rulers, namely, that they devise and give unwholesome and evil counsel. This counsel is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a> by the words placed in their mouths: "house-building is not near; it (the city) is the caldron, we are the flesh."<p>These words are difficult, and different interpretations have consequently been given. The rendering, "it (the judgment) is not near, let us build houses," is incorrect; for the infinitive construct &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; cannot stand for the imperative or the infinitive absolute, but must be the subject of the sentence. It is inadmissible also to take the sentence as a question, "Is not house-building near?" in the sense of "it is certainly near," as Ewald does, after some of the ancient versions. For even if an interrogation is sometimes indicated simply by the tone in an energetic address, as, for example, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a>, this cannot be extended to cases in which the words of another are quoted. Still less can &#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; mean non est tempus, it is not yet time, as Maurer supposes. The only way in which the words can be made to yield a sense in harmony with the context, is by taking them as a tacit allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-5.htm">Jeremiah 29:5</a>. Jeremiah had called upon those in exile to build themselves houses in their banishment, and prepare for a lengthened stay in Babylon, and not to allow themselves to be deceived by the words of false prophets, who predicted a speedy return; for severe judgments had yet to fall upon those who had remained behind in the land. This word of Jeremiah the authorities in Jerusalem ridiculed, saying "house-building is not near," i.e., the house-building in exile is still a long way off; it will not come to this, that Jerusalem should fall either permanently or entirely into the hands of the king of Babylon. On the contrary, Jerusalem is the pot, and we, its inhabitants, are the flesh. The point of comparison is this: as the pot protects the flesh from burning, so does the city of Jerusalem protect us from destruction.<p>(Note: "This city is a pot, our receptacle and defence, and we are the flesh enclosed therein; as flesh is preserved in its caldron till it is perfectly boiled, so shall we continue here till an extreme old age." - Hlsemann in CaloV. Bibl. Illustr.)<p>On the other hand, there is no foundation for the assumption that the words also contain an allusion to other sayings of Jeremiah, namely, to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13</a>, where the judgment about to burst in from the north is represented under the figure of a smoking pot; or to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-1.htm">Jeremiah 19:1-15</a>, where Jerusalem is depicted as a pot about to be broken in pieces by God; for the reference in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-1.htm">Jeremiah 19:1-15</a> is simply to an earthen pitcher, not to a meat-caldron; and the words in the verse before us have nothing at all in common with the figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13</a>. The correctness of our explanation is evident both from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-6.htm">Ezekiel 24:6</a>, where the figure of pot and flesh is met with again, though differently applied, and from the reply which Ezekiel makes to the saying of these men in the verses that follow (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm">Ezekiel 11:7-11</a>). This saying expresses not only false confidence in the strength of Jerusalem, but also contempt and scorn of the predictions of the prophets sent by God. Ezekiel is therefore to prophesy, as he does in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-5.htm">Ezekiel 11:5-12</a>, against this pernicious counsel, which is confirming the people in their sins. </body></html>
