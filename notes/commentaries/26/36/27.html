But no water can do more than take away the filth of the flesh. Water seems in general the sacramental sign of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Ghost; yet this is always connected with the atoning blood of Christ. When the latter is applied by faith to the conscience, to cleanse it from evil works, the former is always applied to the powers of the soul, to purify it from the pollution of sin. All that have an interest in the new covenant, have a new heart and a new spirit, in order to their walking in newness of life. God would give a heart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, complying with his holy will. Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul, as the turning a dead stone into living flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as a Teacher, Guide, and Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit us for our duty, should quicken our constant care and endeavour to do our duty. These are promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to, all true believers in every age.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ezekiel the priest has in view the purifying rites prescribed by the Law, the symbolic purport of which is exhibited in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>. As the Levites were consecrated with sprinkling of water, so should the approved rite "sprinkling of water" thus prescribed by the Law and explained by the prophets, give occasion to the use of water at the admission of proselytes in later days, and so to its adoption by John in his baptism unto repentance. It was hallowed by our Lord when in His discourse with Nicodemus, referring, no doubt, to such passages as these, He showed their application to the Church of which He was about to be the Founder; and when He appointed Baptism as the sacrament of admission into that Church. In this sacrament the spiritual import of the legal ordinance is displayed - the second birth by water and the Spirit. As Israel throughout the prophecy of Ezekiel prefigures the visible Church of Christ, needing from time to time trim or purification - so does the renovated Israel represent Christ's mystical Church <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>. The spiritual character of the renovation presumes a personal application of the prophet's words, which is more thoroughly brought out under the new covenant (e. g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>). Thus the prophecy of Ezekiel furnishes a medium through which we pass from the congregation to the individual, from the letter to the spirit, from the Law to the Gospel, from Moses to Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. my spirit&#8212;(Eze 11:19; Jer 32:39).

In Isaiah 11 the Messianic king has the spirit of Jehovah in all the manifoldness of his operation, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-15.htm" title="When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 32:15</a> the hope is expressed that “the spirit shall be poured on us from on high” (though the passage is held by some to be later than Is.); but it is in exile and post-exile times that the idea is first expressed with great certainty, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-27.htm" title="And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you shall keep my judgments, and do them.">Ezekiel 36:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-14.htm" title="And shall put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall you know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, said the LORD.">Ezekiel 37:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-10.htm" title="Say you to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.">Ezekiel 12:10</a>). Jeremiah does not use the expression, though his promise that Jehovah will write his law on men’s hearts seems to have much the same sense, or at least it expresses the “new spirit” of Ezek., and in the New Testament this new spirit is the spirit of God. There always attaches to “spirit” the idea of power in operation, the spirit of God is God exerting power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to walk in my statutes</span>] Being endowed with the spirit of God they will walk in his statutes, for these are expressions of his spirit. The spirit of God will appear both as an inward impulse to fulfil God’s will, and as a power to do it. In the Old Testament the spirit of God, even the prophetic spirit, is usually a dynamic influence, an elevation of the natural human faculties. The “statutes and judgments” are not the mere external enactments of the law; they embrace all the moral laws to which Ezek. so often refers (e.g. ch. 18, 22, 33), and it is doubtful if the prophet refers specially to written laws at all.</body></html>
