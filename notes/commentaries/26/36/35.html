But no water can do more than take away the filth of the flesh. Water seems in general the sacramental sign of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Ghost; yet this is always connected with the atoning blood of Christ. When the latter is applied by faith to the conscience, to cleanse it from evil works, the former is always applied to the powers of the soul, to purify it from the pollution of sin. All that have an interest in the new covenant, have a new heart and a new spirit, in order to their walking in newness of life. God would give a heart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, complying with his holy will. Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul, as the turning a dead stone into living flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as a Teacher, Guide, and Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit us for our duty, should quicken our constant care and endeavour to do our duty. These are promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to, all true believers in every age.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye shall be my people - (Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>. The writers of the New Testament appropriated these and similar phrases of the Old Testament to the Church of Christ. Between the restoration of the Jews (the first step) there are many steps toward the end - the spread of Christ's Church throughout the world, the conversion of the Gentiles, and the acknowledgment of the true God - which justify men in looking forward to a time when the Gospel shall be preached in all the world, and the earth become the kingdom of God in a fuller sense than it has ever yet been. But all these are "steps." Our prophecies look beyond all this to a new heaven to a new earth, and to a new Jerusalem <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. they shall say&#8212;The heathen, who once made Israel's desolation a ground of reproach against the name of Jehovah Himself (Eze 36:20, 21); but now He so vindicates its sanctity (Eze 36:22, 23) that these same heathen are constrained to acknowledge Israel's more than renewed blessedness to be God's own work, and a ground for glorifying His name (Eze 36:36).<p>Eden&#8212;as Tyre (the type of the world powers in general: so Assyria, a cedar "in the garden of God, Eden," Eze 31:8, 9), in original advantages, had been compared to "Eden, the garden of God" (Eze 28:13), from which she had fallen irrecoverably; so Israel, once desolate, is to be as "the garden of Eden" (Isa 51:3), and is to be so unchangeably.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They shall say; </span> strangers or foreigners, who had heard or seen the sad wastes, and now either hear or see the replanting of it, and how it succeedeth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Like the garden of Eden; </span> see the phrase <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm" title="You have been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that you were created.">Ezekiel 28:13</a></span>; most fruitful, pleasant, and desirable.

The thought of the first Paradise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), in the historicity of which clearly Ezekiel believed, was one on which his mind often dwelt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a>) as an ideal of earthly beauty and fertility which should recur in the closing age of the world - a hope which appears to have been shared by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>), and taken up by John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1-3</a>).
