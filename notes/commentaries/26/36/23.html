The same with his holy name; for his greatness lies in his holiness; which name he sanctifies when he clears it from all charges and imputations; when he makes it appear to be holy and himself to be glorious in holiness; when he vindicates the honour of his name, not in a way of punishment, as he justly might, but in a way of grace and mercy; he sanctifies his name when he proclaims it, a God gracious and merciful; for it was in this way and manner he determined to make himself illustrious and glorious, and do honour to his name: <p>which was profaned among the Heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; this is repeated again and again, to show the heinousness of this sin, how ill he took it at their hands, and what a concern it gave him: <p>and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes; when the Lord shall fulfil his promises, and deliver his people; when he shall sanctify, justify, and save them; and he shall be sanctified, served, and worshipped by them, and among them: it will be taken notice of by infidels themselves; and they shall hereby know, and be obliged to acknowledge, that the God of Israel is the only Lord God; that he is true and faithful to his word, righteous and holy, in his ways, the Lord God omniscient and omnipotent. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">sanctify my great name</span>] To sanctify is the opposite of to profane. As the latter term means to detract from the power, majesty or purity of Jehovah, or from any of those attributes which belong to his godhead, to sanctify is to manifest or make these attributes conspicuous. Hence the effect of Jehovah’s sanctifying his name is that the heathen know him to be Jehovah—God alone and all that which he is who is God alone. In <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm" title="Therefore say to the house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the heathen, where you went.">Ezekiel 36:22</a></span> “holy name,” here “great name”; “greatness” is an element in “holiness.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be sanctified in you</span>] Or reflexive: shew myself holy—where “holy” embraces the attributes of Deity as a whole. Israel is the subject <span class="ital">through</span> which Jehovah shews himself to be God, i.e. by his operations in Israel in the sight of the nations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">24</span> <span class="ital">seq</span>. These operations are his restoration and regeneration of Israel. It is certainly possible that the more internal operations of Jehovah on Israel (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25</a></span> <span class="ital">seq</span>.)—his washing them with clean water and putting a new spirit within them that they shall walk in his statutes, are considered part of Jehovah’s sanctifying of himself in the sight of the nations. They do express better what Jehovah is than a mere exhibition of power, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/39-23.htm" title="And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword....">Ezekiel 39:23-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm" title="To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.">Isaiah 61:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-2.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory: and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.">Isaiah 62:2</a>. At the same time this more general idea seems to pass from the prophet’s mind in the delight with which he dwells on Israel’s religious regeneration. The wider idea is at any rate returned to in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-33.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.">Ezekiel 36:33</a></span> <span class="ital">seq</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will sanctify my great Name</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the name of my holiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>). As Israel's dispersion had caused that Name to be profaned, so Israel's restoration would secure that it should be magnified among the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>), who should learn from this event that their previous ideas of Jehovah, as a feeble and local divinity, had been wrong. The question whether your eyes, as in the Hebrew text, or "their eyes," as in many ancient versions, should be read is debated. The latter reading appears to be demanded by the <span class="accented">usus</span> <span class="accented">loquendi</span> of Ezekiel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-27.htm">Ezekiel 39:27</a>), and is adopted by both English versions as well as by interpreters of eminence; but other expositors of equal name adhere to the former reading on the ground that the sanctifying of Jehovah's Name in the eyes of Israel was an indispensable preliminary to its sanctification in the eyes of the heathen. Havernick regards "their eyes" as "an obvious emendation to relieve a difficulty," to which in no case should criticism accord the preference; while Keil gives it the preference, though admitting that "your eyes" can be justified. </body></html>
