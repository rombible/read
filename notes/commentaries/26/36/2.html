Israel Avenged of Her Foes, and Restored, First to Inward Holiness, Then to Outward Prosperity.<p>The distinction between Israel and the heathen (as Edom) is: Israel has a covenant relation to God ensuring restoration after chastisement, so that the heathen's hope of getting possession of the elect people's inheritance must fail, and they themselves be made desolate (Eze 36:1-15). The reason for the chastisement of Israel was Israel's sin and profanation of God's name (Eze 36:16-21). God has good in store for Israel, for His own name's sake, to revive His people; first, by a spiritual renewal of their hearts, and, next, by an external restoration to prosperity (Eze 36:22-33). The result is that the heathen shall be impressed with the power and goodness of God manifested so palpably towards the restored people (Eze 36:34-38).<p>1, 2. mountains of Israel&#8212;in contrast to "Mount Seir" of the previous prophecy. They are here personified; Israel's elevation is moral, not merely physical, as Edom's. Her hills are "the everlasting hills" of Jacob's prophecy (Ge 49:26). "The enemy" (Edom, the singled-out representative of all God's foes), with a shout of exultation, "Aha!" had claimed, as the nearest kinsman of Israel (the brother of their father Esau), his vacated inheritance; as much as to say, the so-called "everlasting" inheritance of Israel and of the "hills," which typified the unmoved perpetuity of it (Ps 125:1, 2), has come to an end, in spite of the promise of God, and has become "ours" (compare De 32:13; 33:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Many were the enemies of God’s people, but they so conspired in one design, with one consent, and were so one in their humours, and enmity, and carriage, that the prophet speaks of them as one, and particularly of Edom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Aha; </span> rejoicingly and with insulting pride, as Ammon did, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-3.htm" title="And say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus said the Lord GOD; Because you said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;">Ezekiel 25:3</a></span>, and Tyre did, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-2.htm" title="Son of man, because that Tyrus has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned to me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:">Ezekiel 26:2</a></span>, which see. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The ancient high places; </span> the everlasting hills; but this is common with other hills, whose foundations, as these of Israel, are from the beginning, and shall be to the end.

The fuller explanation is given in the verses which follow, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a> onwards. Observe here that biqeer is substituted for &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;, to seek and examine minutely, involves the idea of taking affectionate charge. What the Lord does for His people is compared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a> to the care which a shepherd who deserves the name manifests towards sheep when they are scattered (&#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; without the article is connected with &#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493; in the form of apposition); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a> it is still more particularly explained. In the first place, He will gather them from all the places to which they have been scattered. &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; implies that in their dispersion they have fallen into a state of oppression and bondage among the nations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;  belongs to the relative clause: whither they have been scattered. The circumstance that these words are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a> does not compel us to take them in connection with the principal clause, as Hitzig and Kliefoth propose, and to understand them as relating to the time when God will hold His judgment of the heathen world. The notion that the words in Joel signify "God's day of judgment upon all the heathen" (Kliefoth), is quite erroneous; and even Hitzig does not derive this meaning from <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>, but from the combination of our verse with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-3.htm">Ezekiel 30:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>. The deliverance of the sheep out of the places to which they have been scattered, consists in the gathering together of Israel out of the nations, and their restoration to their own land, and their feeding upon the mountains and all the dwelling-places of the land (&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, a place suitable for settlement), and that in good and fat pasture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14</a>); and lastly, in the fact that Jehovah bestows the necessary care upon the sheep, strengthens and heals the weak and sick (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-15.htm">Ezekiel 34:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Ezekiel 34:16</a>) - that is to say, does just what the bad shepherds have omitted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>) - and destroys the fat and strong. In this last clause another side is shown of the pastoral fidelity of Jehovah. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; has been changed by the lxx, Syr., and Vulg. into  ,&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;; and Luther has followed them in his rendering, "I will watch over them." But this is evidently a mistake, as it fails to harmonize with &#1488;&#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;. The fat and strong sheep are characterized in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-18.htm">Ezekiel 34:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-19.htm">Ezekiel 34:19</a> as those which spoil the food and water of the others. The allusion, therefore, is to the rich and strong ones of the nation, who oppress the humble and poor, and treat them with severity. The destruction of these oppressors shows that the loving care of the Lord is associated with righteousness - that He feeds the flock &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;.<p>This thought is carried out still further in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17-21</a>, the sheep themselves being directly addressed, and the Lord assuring them that He will judge between sheep and sheep, and put an end to the oppressive conduct of the fat sheep and the strong. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;: between the one sheep and the other. &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is extended in the apposition, "the rams and he-goats," which must not be rendered, "with regard to the rams and he-goats," as it has been by Kliefoth. The thought is not that Jehovah will divide the rams and he-goats from the sheep, as some have explained it, from an inappropriate comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>; but the division is to be effected in such a manner that sheep will be separated from sheep, the fat sheep being placed on one side with the rams and he-goats, and kept apart from the lean (&#1512;&#1494;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-20.htm">Ezekiel 34:20</a>) and the sickly sheep (&#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>). It is to the last-named sheep, rams, and he-goats that <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-18.htm">Matthew 25:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-19.htm">Matthew 25:19</a> are addressed. With regard to the charge brought against them, that they eat up the pasture and tread down the remainder with their feet, etc., Bochart has already correctly observed, that "if the words are not quite applicable to actual sheep, they are perfectly appropriate to the mystical sheep intended here, i.e., to the Israelites, among whom many of the rich, after enjoying an abundant harvest and vintage, grudged the poor their gleaning in either one or the other." &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1506;, a substantive formation, like &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1505;, literally, precipitation of the water, i.e., the water purified by precipitation; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1506;, to sink, is the opposite of &#1512;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;, to stir up or render muddy by treading with the feet (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-14.htm">Ezekiel 32:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-20.htm">Ezekiel 34:20</a>  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-22.htm">Ezekiel 34:22</a> brings to a close the description of the manner in which God will deliver His flock, and feed it with righteousness. &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; points back to &#1493;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a>, and &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; to &#1488;&#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Ezekiel 34:16</a>. - To this there is appended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>. a new train of thought, describing how God will still further display to His people His pastoral fidelity. </body></html>
