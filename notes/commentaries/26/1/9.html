This applies to the cherubim only when in motion; when they stood, the wings were let down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm" title="And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.">Ezekiel 1:24</a>). The joining of the extremities of the outstretched wings of the cherubim recalls the arrangement in Solomon’s Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-27.htm" title="And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house.">1Kings 6:27</a>), in which the wings of the larger cherubim touched one another above the mercy-seat.<p><span class= "bld">They turned not when they went.</span>—Whichever way they wished to go, they could still go “straight forward,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the direction towards which they looked, since they looked in all directions, and their round feet made it equally easy to move in any way. It would at first seem that as two of the wings of each cherub were used to cover their bodies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm" title="Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.">Ezekiel 1:11</a>), the wings would have required their turning when they changed their course; but if we conceive of the four cherubim as arranged to form a square, and with their wings moving as one creature, this difficulty disappears.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voice of God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit. These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind with great and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In ver. 4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all his messengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision would impress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure, yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with a glory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creatures came out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and power from God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lion excels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence and patience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagle excels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and the angels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances. The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, they lose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had not only wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick, who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; they have wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them, they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whatever service they went about, they went every one straight forward. When we go straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, we perform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not from their business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever the Spirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these living creatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burning coals of fire; they are seraphim, or burners; denoting the ardour of their love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learn profitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into or understand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peace and duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone they belong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two of the wings were in the act of flying, so stretched out that the extremity of each touched a wing of a neighboring living creature, similarly stretched out. This was only when they were in motion. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>.<p>They went every one straight forward - The four together formed a square, and never altered their relative position. From each side two faces looked straight out, one at each corner - and so all moved together toward any of the four quarters, toward which each one had one of its four faces directed; in whatsoever direction the whole moved the four might be said all to go "straight forward." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. they&#8212;had no occasion to turn themselves round when changing their direction, for they had a face (Eze 1:6) looking to each of the four quarters of heaven. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not be gone over again. Their wings were joined above in pairs (see Eze 1:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their wings were joined one to another; </span> the wings of the living creatures, when stretched out to fly, were joined together; so the wings of those two cherubims which went foremost, and the wings of the two hindermost, were joined together when they moved.

It signifies, however, the equal and uniform readiness of angels, their concord and union with constancy to do the will of God, and it shows us the exact harmony that is between the works of God. These wings, and their being joined, is expressed, Heb. by the union of loving sisters with each other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They turned not when they went; </span> they lost no time in a difficult or tedious turning, as we see in other chariots, for which way soever they were to go, thither they had faces directed, and so readily moved forward on their way, whether east or west, north or south, and held on till they had finished their course, but then were ready for further action, and returned as quick to their station, where they might receive new commands, as lightning does; so this and that <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-14.htm" title="And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.">Ezekiel 1:14</a></span>, there they did return, here they did not, are reconciled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They went every one straight forward:</span> this explains the former, and confirms it to us, assuring us that every one of those living creatures are ready, faithful, and unwearied in doing the pleasure of their Creator, in his government of the world.

Time and place of the same. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>. Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth (month), on the fifth (day) of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a>. On the fifth day of the month, it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>. The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Busi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.<p>Regarding &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; at the beginning of a book, as e.g., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>, cf. the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>. The two notices of the year in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a> are closely connected with the twofold introduction of the theophany. This is described in verse first, according to its form or phenomenal nature, and then in verses second and third, according to its intended purpose, and its effect upon the prophet. The phenomenon consisted in this, that the heavens were opened, and Ezekiel saw visions of God. The heaven opens not merely when to our eye a glimpse is disclosed of the heavenly glory of God (Calvin), but also when God manifests His glory in a manner perceptible to human sight. The latter was the case here. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, "visions of God," are not "visiones praestantissimae," but visions which have divine or heavenly things for their object; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>. Here it is the manifestation of Jehovah's glory described in the following verses. This was beheld by Ezekiel in the thirtieth year, which, according to verse second, was in the fifth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin. The real identity of these two dates is placed beyond doubt by the mention of the same day of the month, "on the fifth day of the month" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>). The fifth year from the commencement of Jehoiachin's captivity is the year 595 b.c.; the thirtieth year, consequently, is the year 625 b.c. But the era, in accordance with which this date is reckoned, is matter of dispute, and can no longer be ascertained with certainty. To suppose, with Hengstenberg, that the reference is to the year of the prophet's own life, is forbidden by the addition "in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month," which points to an era generally recognised. In the year 625 b.c., Nabopolassar became king of Babylon, and therefore many of the older expositors have supposed that Ezekiel means the thirtieth year of the era of Nabopolassar. Nothing, however, is know of any such era. Others, as the Chaldee paraphrast and Jerome, and in modern times also Ideler, are of opinion that the thirtieth year is reckoned from the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah, because in that year the book of the law was discovered, and the regeneration of public worship completed by a solemn celebration of the Passover. No trace, however, can elsewhere be pointed out of the existence of a chronology dating from these events. The Rabbins in Seder Olam assume a chronology according to the periods of the years of jubilee, and so also Hitzig; but for this supposition too all reliable proofs are wanting. At the time mentioned, Ezekiel found himself &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, "in the midst of the exiles," i.e., within the circuit of their settlements, not, in their society; for it is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a> that he was alone when the theophany was imparted to him, and did not repair till afterwards to the residences of the settlers. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>. By the river Chebar, in the land of the Chaldees, i.e., in Babylon or Mesopotamia. The river &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, to be distinguished from &#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, the river of Gosan, which flows into the Tigris, see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>, is the Mesopotamian Chabioras,   &#787;&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (Strabo, xvi. 748), or &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (Ptolem. v. 18, 3), Arab. cha equals bu equals r (Edrisi Clim. iv. p. 6, ii. p. 150, ed. Jaubert and Abulf. Mesopot. in the N. Repertor. III. p. xxiv.), which according to Edrisi takes its rise from "nearly three hundred springs," near the city Ras-el-'Ain, at the foot of the mountain range of Masius, flows through Upper Mesopotamia in a direction parallel with its two principal streams, and then, turning westward, discharges itself into the Euphrates near Kirkesion. There the hand of Jehovah came upon Ezekiel.
