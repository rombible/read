Sometimes one spoke of the wheel is uppermost, sometimes another; but the motion of the wheel on its own axletree is regular and steady. We need not despond in adversity; the wheels are turning round and will raise us in due time, while those who presume in prosperity know not how soon they may be cast down. The wheel is near the living creatures; the angels are employed as ministers of God's providence. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels; the same wisdom, power, and holiness of God, that guide and govern the angels, by them order all events in this lower world. The wheel had four faces, denoting that the providence of God exerts itself in all parts. Look every way upon the wheel of providence, it has a face toward you. Their appearance and work were as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. The disposals of Providence seem to us dark, perplexed, and unaccountable, yet are all wisely ordered for the best. The motion of these wheels was steady, regular, and constant. They went as the Spirit directed, therefore returned not. We should not have to undo that by repentance which we have done amiss, if we followed the guidance of the Spirit. The rings, or rims of the wheels were so vast, that when put in motion the prophet was afraid to look upon them. The consideration of the height and depth of God's counsel should awe us. They were full of eyes round about. The motions of Providence are all directed by infinite Wisdom. All events are determined by the eyes of the Lord, which are in every place beholding the evil and the good; for there is no such thing as chance or fortune. The firmament above was a crystal, glorious, but terribly so. That which we take to be a dark cloud, is to God clear as crystal, through which he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth. When the angels had roused a careless world, they let down their wings, that God's voice might be plainly heard. The voice of Providence is to open men's ears to the voice of the word. Sounds on earth should awaken our attention to the voice from heaven; for how shall we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaks from thence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rings - The felloes (circumference) of the wheels: they were both high and terrible. The "eyes" may have been no more than dazzling spots adding to their brilliancy. But it seems more likely that they had a symbolic meaning expressing either the universal fulfillment of God's will through His creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>), or the constant and unceasing praise which His works are ever rendering to Him <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>. The power of nature is no blind force. it is employed in the service of God's Providence, and the stamp of reason is impressed all over it. It is this very thing that makes the power of nature terrible to him who is at enmity with God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. went by them&#8212;went beside them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When the living creatures went, the wheels went by them; </span> the wheels’ motion or standing depended on the motion and assistance of some higher agent which excited and guided them, when therefore the living creatures, the angels, ministers of God’s will, moved, then did those affairs expressed by wheels move also.

The movement of the wheels corresponded with that of the living creatures. They were animated by the same spirit as the creatures, and were part of the whole living phenomenon. In the Book of Enoch “wheels” (Ophannim) are a class of angels, named along with Seraphim and Cherubim, ch. lxi. 10; lxx. 7.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wheels went by them;</span> better, with Revised Version, <span class="accented">beside them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> moving in parallel lines with them. <span class="cmt_word">And when the living creatures went,</span> etc. The truth embodied in the coincident movements of the "living creatures" and the "wheels," is the harmony of the forces and laws of nature with its outward manifestations of might.

And out of its midst there prominently appeared a figure, consisting of four creatures, and this was their appearance: they had the figure of a man. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-6.htm">Ezekiel 1:6</a>. And each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>. And their feet were upright-standing feet; and the soles of their feet like the soles of a calf, and sparkling like the appearance of shining brass. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a>. And the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and all four had faces and wings. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9</a>. Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not as they went; they went each one in the direction of his face. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>. And the form of their faces was that of a man; and on the right all four had a lion's face; and on the left all four had the face of an ox; and all four had an eagle's face. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm">Ezekiel 1:11</a>. And their faces and their wings were divided above, two of each uniting with one another, and two covering their bodies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-12.htm">Ezekiel 1:12</a>. And they went each in the direction of his face; whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not as they went. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13</a>. And the likeness of the creatures resembled burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: it (the fire) went hither and thither amongst the beings; and the fire was brilliant, and from the fire came forth lightning. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-14.htm">Ezekiel 1:14</a>. And the beings ran hither and thither in a zig-zag manner.<p>From out of the fiery centre of the cloud there shows itself the form (tw%md@;, properly "resemblance," "picture") of four &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, animantia, "living creatures;" &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>; not &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, "wild beasts," as Luther has incorrectly rendered it, after the animalia of the Vulgate. These four creatures had &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, "the figure of a man." Agreeably to this notice, placed at the head of the description, these creatures are to be conceived as presenting the appearance of a human body in all points not otherwise specified in the following narrative. Each of them had four faces and four wings (&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; without the article stands as a distributive, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; are "pinions," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>, not "pairs of wings"). Their feet were &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492;, "a straight foot;" the singular stands generically, stating only the nature of the feet, without reference to their number. We have accordingly to assume in each of the four creatures two legs, as in a man. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; .nam a , "straight," i.e., standing upright, not bent, as when sitting or kneeling. &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; is the whole leg, including the knee and thigh, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;, "sole of the foot," or the under part of the leg, with which we tread on the ground. This part, not the whole leg, resembled the calf's foot, which is firmly planted on the ground. The legs sparkled like the appearance of &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;. The subject of &#1504;&#1510;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; is not "the &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, which are understood to be intended under the &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; in verse fifth" (Hitzig), for this subject is too far distant, but &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, which is here construed as masculine, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>. In this sense are these words apprehended in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>, and &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;  there translated by &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. On this word see Hengstenberg and Dsterdieck on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>. &#1504;&#1495;' &#1511;&#1500;&#1500; probably signifies "light," i.e., "bright, shining brass," as the old translators have rendered it. The Septuagint has &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;; the Vulgate, aes candens; and the Chaldee paraphrase, aes flammans. The signification "smoothed, polished brass" (Bochart), rests upon uncertain combinations; cf. Gesen. Thes. p. 1217, and is appropriate neither here nor in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>, where these words precede, "His face had the appearance of lightning, and his eyes were as a flame of fire." Under the four wings were four hands on the four sides of each cherub, formed like the hands of a man. The wings accordingly rested upon the shoulders, from which the hands came forth. The Chetib &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; may certainly be defended if with Kimchi and others we punctuate &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, and take the suffix distributively and &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; elliptically, "his (i.e., each of the four creatures) hands were (the hands of) a man;" cf. for such an ellipsis as this, passages like that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>, &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, "my feet as the (feet) of hinds;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-2.htm">Job 35:2</a>, &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;, "before the righteousness of God." It is extremely probable, however, that &#1493; is only the error of an old copyist for &#1497;, and that the Keri &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; is the correct reading, as the taking of &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; elliptically is not in keeping with the broad style of Ezekiel, which in its verbosity verges on tautology. The second half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a> is neither, with Hvernick, to be referred to the following ninth verse, where the faces are no more spoken of, nor, with Hitzig, to be arbitrarily mutilated; but is to be taken as it stands, comprising all that has hitherto been said regarding the faces and wings, in order to append thereto in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9</a>. the description of the use and nature of these members. The definite statement, that "the wings were joined one to another," is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm">Ezekiel 1:11</a> limited to the two upper wings, according to which we have so to conceive the matter, that the top or the upper right wing of each cherub came in contact with the top of the left wing of the neighbouring cherub. This junction presented to the eye of the seer the unity and coherence of all the four creatures as a complete whole - a  &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, and implied, as a consequence, the harmonious action in common of the four creatures. They did not turn as they went along, but proceeded each in the direction of his face. &#1488;&#1500;, "over against his face." The meaning is thus rightly given by Kliefoth: "As they had four faces, they needed not to turn as they went, but went on as (i.e., in the direction in which) they were going, always after the face."<p>In the closer description of the faces in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>, the face of the man is first mentioned as that which was turned towards the seer, that of the lion to the right side, the ox to the left, and that of the eagle (behind). In naming these three, it is remarked that all the four creatures had these faces: in naming the man's face, this remark is omitted, because the word &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (referring to all the four) immediately precedes. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm">Ezekiel 1:11</a>, it is next remarked of the faces and wings, that they were divided above (&#1502;&#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "from above," "upward"); then the direction of the wings is more precisely stated. The word &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is neither to be referred to the preceding, "and it was their faces," nor, with Hitzig, to be expunged as a gloss; but is quite in order as a statement that not only the wings but also the faces were divided above, consequently were not like Janus' faces upon one head, but the four faces were planted upon four heads and necks. In the description that follows, &#1495;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is not quite distinct, and #y)i is manifestly to be taken as an abbreviation of &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9</a> : on each were two wings joining one another, i.e., touching with their tops the tips of the wings of the cherub beside them, in accordance with which we have to conceive the wings as expanded. Two were covering their bodies, i.e., each cherub covered his body with the pair of wings that folded downwards; not, as Kliefoth supposes, that the lower wings of the one cherub covered the body of the other cherub beside him, which also is not the meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-23.htm">Ezekiel 1:23</a>; see note on that verse. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-12.htm">Ezekiel 1:12</a>, what is to be said about their movements is brought to a conclusion, while both statements are repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9</a>, and completed by the addition of the principium movens. In whatever direction the &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; "was to go, in that direction they went;" i.e., not according to the action of their own will, but wherever the &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; impelled them. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, however, signifies not "impulse," nor, in this place, even "the wind," as the vehicle of the power of the spiritual life palpable to the senses, which produced and guided their movements, (Kliefoth), but spirit. For, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a>, the movement of the wheels, which was in harmony with the movements of the cherubim, was not caused by the wind, but proceeded from the &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., from the spirit dwelling in the creature. On the contrary, there is not in the whole description, with the exception of the general statement that a tempestuous wind drove from the north the great cloud in which the theophany was enwrapped, any allusion to a means of motion palpable to the senses. In the 13th and 14th verses is described the entire impression produced by the movement of the whole appearance. &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; precedes, and is taken absolutely "as regards the form of the creatures," and corresponds to the &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;  &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5</a>, with which the description of the individual figures which appeared in the brightness of the fire was introduced. Their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; refers to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; as the principal conception. Fire, like the fire of burning coals and torches, went, moved hither and thither amongst the four creatures. This fire presented a bright appearance, and out of it came forth lightnings. The creatures, moreover, were in constant motion. &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1488;, from &#1512;&#1510;&#1488;, an Aramaising form for the Hebrew &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, to run. The infin. absol. stands instead of the finite verb. The conjecture of &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1488;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-7.htm">Genesis 8:7</a> (Hitzig), is inappropriate, because here we have not to think of "coming out," and no reason exists for the striking out of the words, as Hitzig proposes. The continued motion of the creatures is not in contradiction with their perpetually moving on straight before them. "They went hither and thither, and yet always in the direction of their countenances; because they had a countenance looking in the direction of every side" (Kliefoth). &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1511; signifies not "lightning" ( equals &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;), but comes from &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1511;; in Syriac, "to be split," and denotes "the splitting," i.e., the zigzag course of the lightning (Kliefoth).</body></html>
