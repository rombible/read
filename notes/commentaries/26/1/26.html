The constant repetition of the words “likeness” and “appearance” is very striking throughout this vision. They occur five times in this verse, and four times in each of the two following. The prophet thus labours to make it plain that what he saw was not the realities of existing things, but certain symbolic representations given for the purpose of producing their fitting impression upon the mind. It is especially important to remember this in connection with “the <span class= "ital">likeness </span>as the <span class= "ital">appearance </span>of a man” “upon the <span class= "ital">likeness </span>of the throne.” It was not the Divine Being Himself whom Ezekiel saw, but certain appearances to impress upon him the character and attributes of Him whom “no man hath seen, nor can see.”<p><span class= "bld">The appearance of a man</span>—As in the case of the cherubim the form of a man, as the highest known in nature, was made the groundwork to which all their peculiarities were attached, so here, in rising to something still higher, the same basis must be retained in the impossibility of anything better; only that which is added is more vague, as being incapable of any definite description, Yet possibly there may be even her a hint at the great truth of the incarnation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it....">Ezekiel 1:26-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">Above the firmament was the likeness of a throne — </span>Namely, the throne of God. God having given his prophet emblems of his attendants and ministers, while he was coming forth in the chariot of his power and justice, to execute judgment, and of the mysterious dispensations of his providence toward his church and the world, he now proceeds to discover to him some glimpses of his divine glory. The prophet does not say that he saw a real throne, but only the <span class="ital">likeness of a throne, </span>emblematical, doubtless, of God’s sovereign power and dominion over all creatures, whether in heaven or on earth. God is described in Scripture as <span class="ital">dwelling in light, </span>and <span class="ital">clothing himself with it. </span>So the throne of God is here described as made up of light resembling the colours and brightness of <span class="ital">a sapphire-stone.

But in this vision the form and shape of a man are directly represented to Ezekiel, as a prelude or figure of the incarnation.” This, indeed, was doubtless the ever- blessed and only-begotten Son of God, who was in due time to assume human nature, and in that nature to be the visible image and representative of his invisible Father, whom no man hath seen, or can see, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting.

The first thing observed was a throne. It is a throne of glory, a throne of grace, a throne of triumph, a throne of government, a throne of judgment. It is good news to men, that the throne above the firmament is filled with One who appears, even there, in the likeness of a man. The throne is surrounded with a rainbow, the well-known emblem of the covenant, representing God's mercy and covenanted love to his people. The fire of God's wrath was breaking out against Jerusalem, but bounds should be set to it; he would look upon the bow, and remember the covenant. All the prophet saw was only to prepare him for what he was to hear. When he fell on his face, he heard the voice of One that spake. God delights to teach the humble. Let sinners, then, humble themselves before him. And let believers think upon his glory, that they may be gradually changed into his image by the Spirit of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sapphire - Clear heavenly blue.<p>The appearance of a man - Deeply significant is the form of this manifestation. Here is no angel conveying God's message to man, but the glory of the Lord Himself. We recognize in this vision the prophetic annunciation of the Holy Incarnation. We are told little of the extent to which the human form was made evident to the prophet. For the vision was rather to the mind than to the bodily eye, and even inspired language was inadequate to convey to the hearer the glory which eye hath not seen or ear heard, and which only by special revelation it hath entered into the heart of man to conceive. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. The Godhead appears in the likeness of enthroned humanity, as in Ex 24:10. Besides the "paved work of a sapphire stone, as it were the body of heaven in clearness," there, we have here the "throne," and God "as a man," with the "appearance of fire round about." This last was a prelude of the incarnation of Messiah, but in His character as Saviour and as Judge (Re 19:11-16). The azure sapphire answers to the color of the sky. As others are called "sons of God," but He "the Son of God," so others are called "sons of man" (Eze 2:1, 3), but He "the Son of man" (Mt 16:13), being the embodied representative of humanity and the whole human race; as, on the other hand, He is the representative of "the fulness of the Godhead" (Col 2:9). While the cherubim are movable, the throne above, and Jehovah who moves them, are firmly fixed. It is good news to man, that the throne above is filled by One who even there appears as "a man."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Above the firmament; </span> the crystalline firmament which appeared in the vision, not the vast expanse or firmament in which are sun, moon, and stars. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That was over their heads; </span> heads of the living creatures which moved the wheels, and stood by the chariot. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; </span> in view appeared a sapphire stone, like or in likeness of a throne; so the Hebrew, though we transpose the words somewhat in our version: the sapphire speaks splendour and preciousness; the throne speaks the authority and power of him who sitteth thereon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As the appearance of a man; </span> Christ, God-man, who here appears as King and Judge to vindicate his own honour, to punish rebels, and to give warning by his prophet ere he execute his just but severe indignation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And above the firmament that was over their heads,....

The rendering of LXX. makes the sapphire stone different from the throne, the former being the ground on which the throne was placed.

High above the azure expanse was the <span class="accented">likeness</span> of a throne (we note the constant recurrence of the word "likeness," nine times in this one chapter, as indicating Ezekiel's consciousness of the vision character of what he saw). The idea of the throne of the great King first appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>, is frequent in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>), notably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>. In the visions of St John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, and <span class="accented">passim</span>) it is the dominant, central object throughout. <span class="cmt_word">As the appearance of a sapphire stone.</span> The intense blue of the sapphire has made it in all ages the natural symbol of a heavenly purity. Ezekiel's vision reproduces that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>. It appears among the gems of the high priest's breastplate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-18.htm">Exodus 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-11.htm">Exodus 39:11</a>) and in the "foundations" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>. The description of the sapphire given by Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:9), as "never transparent, and refulgent with spots of gold," suggests lapis lazuli. As used in the Old Testament, however, the word probably means the sapphire of modern jewellery (Braun, 'De Vest. Sacerd.,' p. 630, edit. 1680). <span class="cmt_word">A likeness as of the appearance of a man.</span> The throne, the symbol of the sovereignty of God over the "living creatures" and the "wheels," over the forces and the laws which they represented, is not empty. There was "a likeness as of the appearance" (we note again the accumulation of words intended to guard against the thought that what was seen was more than an approximate symbolism) "of a man." In that likeness there was the witness that we can only think of God by reasoning upward from all that is highest in our conceptions of human greatness and goodness, and thinking of them as free from their present limitations. Man's highest thought of God is that it is "a face like his face that receives him." He finds a humanity in the Godhead. It is noticeable that this preluding anticipation of the thought of the Incarnation, not recognized in the vision of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>) or Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1), appears prominently in the two prophets of the exile - here and in the memorable Messianic vision of "One like unto the ['a,' Revised Version] Son of man" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. What might have been perilously anthropomorphic in the early stages of the growth of Israel, when men tended to identify the symbol with the thing symbolized, was now made subservient to the truth which underlies even  anthropomorphic thought (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>). Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' 4:20. 10), it may be noted, dwells on the fact that Ezekiel uses the words, "'haec visio similitudmis gloriae Domini,' ne quis putaret forte eum in his proprie vidisse Deum." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The four wheels beside the cherubim. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15</a>. And I saw the creatures, and, lo, there was a wheel upon the earth beside the creatures, towards their four fronts. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16</a>. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the appearance of the chrysolite; and all four had one kind of figure: and their appearance and their work was as if one wheel were within the other. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-17.htm">Ezekiel 1:17</a>. Towards their four sides they went when they moved: they turned not as they went. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>. And their felloes, they were high and terrible; and their felloes were full of eyes round about in all the four. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19</a>. And when the creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the creatures raised themselves up from the earth, the wheels also raised themselves. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a>. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went in the direction in which the spirit was to go; and the wheels raised themselves beside them: for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>. When the former moved, the latter moved also; when the former stood, the latter stood; and when the former raised themselves from the ground, the wheels raised themselves beside them: for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. - The words, "and I saw the creatures," prepare the way for the transition to the new object which presented itself in these creatures to the eye of the seer. By the side of these creatures upon the ground he sees a wheel, and that at the four fronts, or front faces of the creatures. The singular suffix in &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; can neither be referred, with Rosenmller, to the chariot, which is not mentioned at all, nor, with Hitzig, to the preposition &#1488;&#1510;&#1500;, nor, with Hvernick, Maurer, and Kliefoth, to &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503;, and so be understood as if every wheel looked towards four sides, because a second wheel was inserted in it at right angles. This meaning is not to be found in the words. The suffix refers ad sensum to &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (Ewald), or, to express it more correctly, to the figure of the cherubim with its four faces turned to the front, conceived as a unity - as one creature (&#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>). Accordingly, we have so to represent the matter, that by the side of the four cherubim, namely, beside his front face, a wheel was to be seen upon the earth. Ezekiel then saw four wheels, one on each front of a cherub, and therefore immediately speaks in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16</a> of wheels (in the plural). In this verse &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is adspectus, and &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; "work;" i.e., both statements employing the term "construction," although in the first hemistich only the appearance, in the second only the construction, of the wheels is described. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is a chrysolite of the ancients, the topaz of the moderns, - a stone having the lustre of gold. The construction of the wheels was as if one wheel were within a wheel, i.e., as if in the wheel a second were inserted at right angles, so that without being turned it could go towards all the four sides. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>, stands absolutely. "As regards their felloes," they possessed height and terribleness-the latter because they were full of eyes all round. Hitzig arbitrarily understands &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; of the upper sides; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, after the Arabic, of the under side, or that which lies towards the back. The movement of the wheels completely followed the movement of the creatures (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19-21</a>), because the spirit of the creature was in the wheels. &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>, is not the "principle of life" (Hvernick), but the cherubic creatures conceived as a unity, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>, where the meaning is undoubted. The sense is: the wheels were, in their motion and rest, completely bound by the movements and rest of the creatures, because the spirit which ruled in them was also in the wheels, and regulated their going, standing, and rising upwards. By the  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; the wheels are bound in one with the cherub-figures, but not by means of a chariot, to or upon which the cherubim were attached. </body></html>
