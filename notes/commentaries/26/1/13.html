This might also be intended as a symbolical declaration, that after the long patience of God, all things now tended to vengeance, and the executing of his judgments upon the Jews; for executing which he would use these angels as ministers. <span class="ital">And like the appearance of lamps — </span>This probably signified, that the uprightness of the divine justice should shine forth, or be made manifest in these judgments. <span class="ital">It went up and down among the living creatures — </span>That is, the fire moved itself up and down. Milton’s expression, (<span class="ital">Paradise Lost, </span>6:756,) is, “And careening fires between.” That is, fires which ran swiftly, and, as it were, tilted at each other: emblematical of the terrible effects of the ministry of these living creatures on the objects of divine vengeance. <span class="ital">Out of the fire went forth lightning — </span>Significative of the irresistible force of the divine judgments, and the terrible and sudden destruction to be produced by them. <span class="ital">And the living creatures ran and returned as a flash of lightning — </span>With inexpressible velocity: the swiftness of their motions every way resembled flashes of lightning. “They ran to do their work, and execute their orders,” says Henry, “and then returned to give an account of what they had done, and receive new instructions. They ran into the lower world, to do what was to be done there: and when they had done, <span class="ital">returned as a flash of lightning, </span>to the upper world, to the vision of God. Thus we should be in the affairs of this world: though we run into them, we must not repose in them, but our souls must presently return like lightning to God, their rest and centre.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voice of God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit. These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind with great and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In ver. 4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all his messengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision would impress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure, yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with a glory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creatures came out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and power from God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lion excels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence and patience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagle excels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and the angels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances. The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, they lose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had not only wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick, who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; they have wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them, they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whatever service they went about, they went every one straight forward. When we go straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, we perform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not from their business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever the Spirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these living creatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burning coals of fire; they are seraphim, or burners; denoting the ardour of their love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learn profitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into or understand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peace and duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone they belong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lamps - "like the appearance of" flames.

That is, of their bodies; for their faces, feet, hands, and wings are described before: <p>their appearance was like burning coals of fire: because of their ministerial gifts; the gifts of the Spirit are compared to fire, and like coals of fire are to be stirred up, and not covered or quenched; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>; and because of their clear shining light in the truths of the Gospel; and because of their ardent love to Christ, and the souls of men; the coals whereof give a most vehement flame, which all the waters of reproach and persecution cannot quench, Sol 8:6; and because of their burning zeal for the glory of God, and the interest of the Redeemer; hence they are called "seraphim", fiery or burning <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>; <p>and like the appearance of lamps: so the ministers of the Gospel are compared to lamps, which hold forth the light of the Gospel to the sons of men; they are the lights or lamps of the world, and some of them are bright burning and shining ones, as John was, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>; <p>it went up and down among the living creatures; that is, fire went up and down among them; so the Targum, <p>"and fire inflamed was among the creatures;'' <p>by which may be meant the word of God, comparable to fire, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>; common to all the ministers of the Gospel, by which their minds are enlightened, and their hearts are warmed and filled with zeal, and by which they are the means of enlightening and warming others: <p>and the fire was bright; and clear, as the word of God is: <p>and out of the fire went forth lightning; by means of the ministry of the word, the kingdom and interest of Christ spread like lightning in the world, from east to west; so the coming of the son of man in his kingdom and power is compared to lightning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>; it denotes the quick, penetrating, and enlightening power and efficacy of the word. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. A slight correction of the text after LXX. is necessary in this verse, which should read as R.V. marg., <span class="bld">and in the midst of the living creatures was an appearance like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches.</span> The description of the living creatures themselves was finished in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-12.htm" title="And they went every one straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.">Ezekiel 1:12</a></span>; in this verse the prophet refers to the fire that was between them (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.

The whole phenomenon represents not only a chariot on which Jehovah rides, but also a throne on which he sits and a place where he abides. Hence as in Isaiah 6 there is an altar with fire. With the idea of Isaiah, however, the prophet has combined the other that coals of fire accompany the manifestation of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-13.htm" title="The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.">Psalm 18:13</a>), and the altar fire gives out flashes like the lightning.

It may not be amiss to note the fact that the phrase throughout the Bible denotes incandescent wood. The nearest approach to its  use by Ezekiel is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-9.htm">2 Samuel 22:9, 13</a>. For "lamps," read, with the Revised Version, "torches." Here the vision of Ezekiel, in which the living creatures were thus incandescent, bathed, as it were, in the fire that played around them, yet not consumed, followed in the path of previous symbols - of the burning bush (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>), of the pillar of fire by night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-22.htm">Exodus 13:22</a>), of the fire on Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), of the "fire of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>), and the "fire of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-12.htm">2 Kings 1:12</a>). Speaking generally, "fire," as distinct from "light," seems to be the symbol of the power of God as manifested against evil. "Our God is a consuming Fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).

These four creatures had &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, "the figure of a man." Agreeably to this notice, placed at the head of the description, these creatures are to be conceived as presenting the appearance of a human body in all points not otherwise specified in the following narrative. Each of them had four faces and four wings (&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; without the article stands as a distributive, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; are "pinions," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>, not "pairs of wings"). Their feet were &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492;, "a straight foot;" the singular stands generically, stating only the nature of the feet, without reference to their number. We have accordingly to assume in each of the four creatures two legs, as in a man. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; .nam a , "straight," i.e., standing upright, not bent, as when sitting or kneeling. &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; is the whole leg, including the knee and thigh, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;, "sole of the foot," or the under part of the leg, with which we tread on the ground. This part, not the whole leg, resembled the calf's foot, which is firmly planted on the ground. The legs sparkled like the appearance of &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;. The subject of &#1504;&#1510;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; is not "the &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, which are understood to be intended under the &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; in verse fifth" (Hitzig), for this subject is too far distant, but &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, which is here construed as masculine, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>.

Under the four wings were four hands on the four sides of each cherub, formed like the hands of a man. The wings accordingly rested upon the shoulders, from which the hands came forth. The Chetib &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; may certainly be defended if with Kimchi and others we punctuate &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, and take the suffix distributively and &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; elliptically, "his (i.e., each of the four creatures) hands were (the hands of) a man;" cf. for such an ellipsis as this, passages like that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>, &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, "my feet as the (feet) of hinds;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-2.htm">Job 35:2</a>, &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;, "before the righteousness of God." It is extremely probable, however, that &#1493; is only the error of an old copyist for &#1497;, and that the Keri &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; is the correct reading, as the taking of &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; elliptically is not in keeping with the broad style of Ezekiel, which in its verbosity verges on tautology. The second half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a> is neither, with Hvernick, to be referred to the following ninth verse, where the faces are no more spoken of, nor, with Hitzig, to be arbitrarily mutilated; but is to be taken as it stands, comprising all that has hitherto been said regarding the faces and wings, in order to append thereto in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9</a>. the description of the use and nature of these members. The definite statement, that "the wings were joined one to another," is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm">Ezekiel 1:11</a> limited to the two upper wings, according to which we have so to conceive the matter, that the top or the upper right wing of each cherub came in contact with the top of the left wing of the neighbouring cherub. This junction presented to the eye of the seer the unity and coherence of all the four creatures as a complete whole - a  &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, and implied, as a consequence, the harmonious action in common of the four creatures. They did not turn as they went along, but proceeded each in the direction of his face. &#1488;&#1500;, "over against his face." The meaning is thus rightly given by Kliefoth: "As they had four faces, they needed not to turn as they went, but went on as (i.e., in the direction in which) they were going, always after the face."<p>In the closer description of the faces in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>, the face of the man is first mentioned as that which was turned towards the seer, that of the lion to the right side, the ox to the left, and that of the eagle (behind). In naming these three, it is remarked that all the four creatures had these faces: in naming the man's face, this remark is omitted, because the word &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (referring to all the four) immediately precedes. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm">Ezekiel 1:11</a>, it is next remarked of the faces and wings, that they were divided above (&#1502;&#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "from above," "upward"); then the direction of the wings is more precisely stated. The word &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is neither to be referred to the preceding, "and it was their faces," nor, with Hitzig, to be expunged as a gloss; but is quite in order as a statement that not only the wings but also the faces were divided above, consequently were not like Janus' faces upon one head, but the four faces were planted upon four heads and necks. In the description that follows, &#1495;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is not quite distinct, and #y)i is manifestly to be taken as an abbreviation of &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9</a> : on each were two wings joining one another, i.e., touching with their tops the tips of the wings of the cherub beside them, in accordance with which we have to conceive the wings as expanded. Two were covering their bodies, i.e., each cherub covered his body with the pair of wings that folded downwards; not, as Kliefoth supposes, that the lower wings of the one cherub covered the body of the other cherub beside him, which also is not the meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-23.htm">Ezekiel 1:23</a>; see note on that verse. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-12.htm">Ezekiel 1:12</a>, what is to be said about their movements is brought to a conclusion, while both statements are repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9</a>, and completed by the addition of the principium movens. In whatever direction the &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; "was to go, in that direction they went;" i.e., not according to the action of their own will, but wherever the &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; impelled them. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, however, signifies not "impulse," nor, in this place, even "the wind," as the vehicle of the power of the spiritual life palpable to the senses, which produced and guided their movements, (Kliefoth), but spirit. For, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a>, the movement of the wheels, which was in harmony with the movements of the cherubim, was not caused by the wind, but proceeded from the &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., from the spirit dwelling in the creature. On the contrary, there is not in the whole description, with the exception of the general statement that a tempestuous wind drove from the north the great cloud in which the theophany was enwrapped, any allusion to a means of motion palpable to the senses. In the 13th and 14th verses is described the entire impression produced by the movement of the whole appearance. &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; precedes, and is taken absolutely "as regards the form of the creatures," and corresponds to the &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;  &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5</a>, with which the description of the individual figures which appeared in the brightness of the fire was introduced. Their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; refers to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; as the principal conception. Fire, like the fire of burning coals and torches, went, moved hither and thither amongst the four creatures. This fire presented a bright appearance, and out of it came forth lightnings. The creatures, moreover, were in constant motion. &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1488;, from &#1512;&#1510;&#1488;, an Aramaising form for the Hebrew &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, to run. The infin. absol. stands instead of the finite verb. The conjecture of &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1488;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-7.htm">Genesis 8:7</a> (Hitzig), is inappropriate, because here we have not to think of "coming out," and no reason exists for the striking out of the words, as Hitzig proposes. The continued motion of the creatures is not in contradiction with their perpetually moving on straight before them. "They went hither and thither, and yet always in the direction of their countenances; because they had a countenance looking in the direction of every side" (Kliefoth). &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1511; signifies not "lightning" ( equals &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;), but comes from &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1511;; in Syriac, "to be split," and denotes "the splitting," i.e., the zigzag course of the lightning (Kliefoth).</body></html>
