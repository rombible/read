And the building at the front of the separate place was seventy cubits broad on the side turned toward the west, and the wall of the building five cubits broad round about, and its length ninety cubits. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a>. And he measured the (temple) house: the length a hundred cubits; and the separate place, and its building, and its walls: the length a hundred cubits. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-14.htm">Ezekiel 41:14</a>. And the breadth of the face of the (temple) house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits. - The explanation of these verses depends upon the meaning of the word &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;. According to its derivation from &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, to cut, to separate, &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; means that which is cut off, or separated. Thus &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is the land cut off, the desert, which is not connected by roads with the inhabited country. In the passage before us, &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; signifies a place on the western side of the temple, i.e., behind the temple, which was separated from the sanctuary (Plate I J), and on which a building stood, but concerning the purpose of which nothing more definite is stated than we are able to gather, partly from the name and situation of the place in question, and partly from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>, according to which, even in Solomon's temple, there was a similar space at the back of the temple house with buildings upon it, which had a separate way out, the gate &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;, namely, that "this space,with its buildings, was to be used for the reception of all refuse, sweepings, all kinds of rubbish, - in brief, of everything that was separated or rejected when the holy service was performed in the temple, - and that this was the reason why it received the name of the separate place" (Kliefoth). The building upon this space was situated &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, in the front of the gizrah (that is to say, as one approached it from the temple); and that &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, on the side of the way to the sea, i.e., on the western side, sc. of the temple, and had a breadth of seventy cubits (from north to south), with a wall round about, which was five cubits broad (thick), and a length of ninety cubits. As the thickness of the wall is specially mentioned in connection with the breadth, we must add it both to the breadth and to the length of the building as given here; so that, when looked at from the outside, the building was eighty cubits broad and a hundred cubits long. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a> this length is expressly attributed to the separate place, and (i.e., along with) its building, and the walls thereof. But the length of the temple house has also been previously stated as a hundred cubits. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-14.htm">Ezekiel 41:14</a> the breadth of both is also stated to have been a hundred cubits - namely, the breadth of the outer front, or front face of the temple, was a hundred cubits; and the breadth of the separate place &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; toward the east, i.e., the breadth which it showed to the person measuring on the eastern side, was the same. If, them, the building on the separate place was only eighty cubits broad, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>, including the walls, whilst the separate place itself was a hundred cubits broad, there remains a space of twenty cubits in breadth not covered by the building; that is to say, as we need not hesitate to put the building in the centre, open spaces of ten cubits each on the northern and southern sides were left as approaches to the building on both sides (K), whereas the entire length of the separate place (from east to west) was covered by the building. - All these measurements are in perfect harmony. As the inner court formed a square of a hundred cubits in length (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>), the temple house, which joined it on the west, extended with its appurtenances to a similar length; and the separate place behind the temple also covered a space of equal size. These three squares, therefore, had a length from east to west of three hundred cubits. If we add to this the length of the buildings of the east gates of the inner and outer courts, namely fifty cubits for each (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-15.htm">Ezekiel 40:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-29.htm">Ezekiel 40:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-33.htm">Ezekiel 40:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-36.htm">Ezekiel 40:36</a>), and the length of the outer court from gate to gate a hundred cubits (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>), we obtain for the whole of the temple building the length of five hundred cubits. If, again, we add to the breadth of the inner court or temple house, which was one hundred cubits, the breadths of the outer court, with the outer and inner gate-buildings, viz., two hundred cubits on both the north and south sides, we obtain a total breadth of 100 + 200 + 200  equals  500 (say five hundred) cubits; so that the whole building covered a space of five hundred cubits square, in harmony with the calculation already made (at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-24.htm">Ezekiel 40:24-27</a>) of the size of the surrounding wall. </body></html>
