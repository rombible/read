The sacrifices at this feast are to be the same as at the Passover, and are to be repeated for each day of the feast. There is in this an entire change from the peculiar ordinances of the Mosaic law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/29-12.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days:">Numbers 29:12-24</a>), and on the whole a great diminution in the number of sacrifices, with a simplification of the ritual, and an omission of the eighth day, added to the feast by the Mosaic law.<p>Ezekiel here omits altogether the Feast of Pentecost, the Day of Atonement, and the Day of Trumpets (the first of the seventh month); for these he substitutes a special sin offering for the first and seventh days of the first month, and for the first day of the Paschal feast; he, moreover, largely modifies the ritual of the two feasts which he retains. All this essentially transforms the ideas which form the basis of the cycle of the Mosaic feasts. No attempt was ever made by the Jews of the restoration to carry out the scheme here set forth; and it appears to have been regarded by the prophet’s contemporaries and successors as purely ideal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/45.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-25.htm" title="In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.">Ezekiel 45:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">In the seventh month — </span>According to their ecclesiastical account, which is <span class="ital">Tisri, </span>and answers to part of our August and September. <span class="ital">In the fifteenth day, &c., shall he do the like — </span>Namely, the prince. On that day the feast of tabernacles began, and continued seven days. Here we see the deficiency of the legal sacrifices for sin; they were often repeated, not only every year, but every feast, and every day of the feast, because <span class="ital">they could not make the comers thereunto perfect. </span>Hence we may also learn the necessity of frequently repeating the same religious exercises. Indeed, the sacrifice of atonement was offered once for all; but the sacrifice of acknowledgment, that of a broken heart, that of a thankful heart, must be offered every day. And these spiritual sacrifices are always acceptable to God through Christ Jesus. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Feast of tabernacles (compare the marginal references).

As a new solemnity, the feast of consecration is to prepare for the passover; so the passover itself is to have different sacrifices from those of the Mosaic law. Instead of one ram and seven lambs for the daily burnt offering, there are to be seven bullocks and seven rams. So also whereas the feast of tabernacles had its own offerings, which diminished as the days of the feast advanced, here the same are appointed as on the passover. Thus it is implied that the letter of the law is to give place to its spirit, those outward rites of Judaism having no intrinsic efficacy, but symbolizing the spiritual truths of Messiah's kingdom, as for instance the perfect holiness which is to characterize it. Compare 1Co 5:7, 8, as to our spiritual "passover," wherein, at the Lord's supper, we feed on Christ by faith, accompanied with "the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth." Literal ordinances, though not slavishly bound to the letter of the law, will set forth the catholic and eternal verities of Messiah's kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The seventh month, </span> according to their ecclesiastical account, Tisri, which answers to part of our August and September. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The fifteenth day; </span> on that day the feast of tabernacles began, and it continued seven days. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall he, </span> the prince, as before, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-24.htm" title="And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.">Ezekiel 45:24</a></span>, do the like, in every respect, for sacrifices, and all that belonged to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to the sin offering, </span>& c.: as was required at the passover, so at this feast also, and therefore you are referred to the particulars of that feast. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/45.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month,....

That is, the same sacrifices should be offered daily throughout the seven days of this feast as had been offered during the seven days of the former feast. That this feast was designed to represent the ancient Feast of Tabernacles can scarcely be doubted, though the practice of living in booths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40-43</a>) is not adverted to. Possibly this may have been omitted, as Keil remarks, "because the practice of living in booths would be dropped in the time to come" (see, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14-17</a>), or, as Kliefoth observes, "because, when Ezekiel's Torah should come into operation, the people of God would be dwelling in the eternal tabernacles of which the booths of the Mosaic Torah were but the types." Nor are the deviations of Ezekiel's Torah from that of Moses, in respect of the daily offerings prescribed for this feast, fewer or of less importance than those which have been noted in connection with the Passover. Ezekiel's Torah prescribes for a burnt offering seven bullocks and seven rams daily, for a sin offering a he-goat daily, for a meat offering an ephah of flour with a hin of oil for each bullock and each ram daily; the Mosaic Torah, while retaining the he goat for a sin offering, required - for a burnt offering on the first day thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs, and so on, diminishing by one bullock each day, till the seventh, when seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs should be sacrificed; and for a meal offering three-tenths of an ephah of flour for every bullock, and two-tenths of an ephah for every ram, and one-tenth of an ephah for each lamb, according to the number of bullocks, rams, and lambs for each day. In addition, the Mosaic celebration concluded with a solemn assembly with special sacrifices on the eighth day (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-39</a>), of which no mention is made in Ezekiel. Nor should it be overlooked that Ezekiel's Torah omits all reference to the other great festival that figures in the Mosaic Torah, viz. that of Pentecost, or the Feast of Weeks, as well as to the Feast of Trumpets and the great Day of Atonement (see on ver. 21), although Hengstenberg is of opinion that Ezekiel, having instanced the Passover and Tabernacles, the beginning and end of the feast-cycle already known to the Jews, designed that all the feasts which lay between should be included. Be this, however, as it may, to infer from the deviations in Ezekiel's Torah from that of Moses, as George, Vatke, Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, Robertson Smith, Cornill, and Driver have done, that the latter had no existence in the time of Ezekiel is, as Havernick observes, not only to render Ezekiel's representations completely unintelligible, but to beg the entire question between the newer criticism and the old faith. "How will one generally explain," asks Cornill ('Einleitung in das Alte Testament,' p. 64), "that a Jerusalem priest sets up a Torah for the future, which completely ignores the priest code (?), in all points remains far behind its requirements (?), and in a groping manner lays hold of the future, instead of appropriating to himself the finished system (i.e. of the, so-called priest code, supposing it to have then existed)? Why does Ezekiel require, in the cultus (which he sets up) so much less than <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>, and 29.? Where, in Ezekiel is the high priest, who for the priest code is the center of the theocracy? Where is the great Day of Atonement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.?" and so on. The answer to these interrogations is that Ezekiel did not intend to republish the Mosaic Torah, but to modify it so as to meet the requirements of the new era, or (perhaps better) to express more adequately the new conceptions of religion and worship he had been commissioned to set before his fellow-exiles; and that Ezekiel had a perfect right to deal in this way even with the Mosaic Torah, inasmuch as he distinctly claimed, in committing to writing the details of his temple- vision, to be acting under special Divine guidance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5</a>). Canon Driver ('An Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament,' p. 133) admits that the argument from Ezekiel's deviations from the so-called priest-code in favor of the later origin of the latter, if "taken by itself, would not, perhaps, be a decisive one," and even adds that, "however doubtful it may be whether Ezekiel presupposes the <span class="accented">completed</span> priests' code, it is difficult not to conclude that he presupposes <span class="accented">parts</span> of it" ibid., p. 138). But if none of it existed before Ezekiel, then a counter-question to that of Cornill may be put, "How is it to be explained that the unknown author of the priests' code should have allowed himself to deviate so far from the arrangements which Ezekiel, a prophet acting under Jehovah's guidance, had established?" The natural reply is that when the priests' code was composed, Ezekiel's Torah did not exist. If the newer criticism believes that Ezekiel would not have deviated so largely as he has done from the rites prescribed in the priests' code had these been in operation and invested with authority (see 'Drivel', 'An Introduction,' etc., p. 133), the newer criticism should explain how the priests' code came to deviate from the Torah of Ezekiel, which, if it was not then in actual operation, was at least invested with Divine authority. Is it not every way as logical to infer, from the deviations of the priests' code (supposing it to be post-exilic) from the Torah of Ezekiel, that the author of the priests' code could not have known of the existence of Ezekiel's Torah, and therefore that it could not then have been in existence, as <span class="accented">vice versa</span> that Ezekiel had no acquaintance with the priests' code, and that therefore it had not in his day been composed? The impartial reasoner, with no theory to uphold, will recognize that the two arguments run exactly purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Altar of Burnt-Offering in the holy place (see Plate III n). "The abrupt style of writing is still continued." The altar wood for the altar was of wood three cubits high; its length, i.e., the expanse of the wall from one corner to the other, was two cubits; the breadth (thickness), which is not expressly mentioned, was the same, because the square form is presupposed from the shape of this altar in the tabernacle and Solomon's temple. Under the term &#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, its corner-pieces, the horns projecting at the corners, or the horn-shaped points, are probably included, as the simple mention of the corners appears superfluous, and the horns, which were symbolically significant features in the altar, would certainly not have been wanting. There is something strange in the occurrence of &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; before and along with &#1511;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, as the length is already included in the walls, and it would not be appropriately said of the length that it was of wood. &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; is therefore certainly a copyist's error for &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (lxx), its stand or pedestal. The angel describes this altar as the "table which stands before Jehovah" - in perfect harmony with the epithet already applied to the sacrifices in the Pentateuch, the "bread (&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;) of God," though not "because the altar table was intended to combine the old table of shewbread and the altar of incense" (Bttcher). The table of shewbread is not mentioned any more than the candlestick and other portions of the temple furniture. - The altar of burnt-offering stood before Jehovah, i.e., before the entrance into the holy of holies. This leads in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a>. to the notice of the doors of the sanctuary, the character of which is also described as simply openings (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;), since the doorway had been mentioned before. delet &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; signifies a moveable door, and the plural &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;, doors, whether they consist of one leaf or two, i.e., whether they are single or folding doors. Here the &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-24.htm">Ezekiel 41:24</a> (&#1500;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;) are folding doors; on the other hand, the first &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-24.htm">Ezekiel 41:24</a> and &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; ibid. are used for the wings of the door, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; for the swinging portions (leaves) of the separate wings. The meaning is this: the holy place (&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;) and the holy of holies (&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;) had two folding doors (i.e., each of these rooms had one). These doors had two wings, and each of these wings, in the one door and in the other, had two reversible door-leaves, so that when going in and out there was no necessity to throw open on every occasion the whole of the wing, which was at least three or four cubits broad. There is no foundation for the objection raised by Kliefoth to the interpretation of &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; &#1493;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; as signifying the holy place and the holy of holies; since he cannot deny that the two words are so used, &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-17.htm">1 Kings 6:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-33.htm">1 Kings 6:33</a>, and &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-3</a>, etc. And the artificial explanation, "to the temple space, and indeed to the holy place," not only passes without notice the agreement between our verses and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31-34</a>, but gains nothing further than a side door, which does violence to the dignity of the sanctuary, a passage from the side chambers into the holy place, with which Bttcher has presented Solomon's temple. - These doors were ornamented, like the walls, with figures of cherubim and palms. - Other remarks are added in vv. 25b and 26 concerning the porch in front of the holy place. The first is, that on the front of the porch outside there was &#1506;&#1489; &#1488;&#1509;. The only other passage in which the word &#1506;&#1489; occurs in a similar connection is <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>, where it refers to wood-work in front of the Ulam of Solomon's porch of pillars; and it cannot be determined whether it signifies threshold, or moulding, or threshold-mouldings. On the shoulders, i.e., on the right and left side walls of the front porch, there were closed windows and figures of palms. The cherubim were omitted here. - The last words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-26.htm">Ezekiel 41:26</a> are very obscure. &#1493;&#1510;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468; may be taken in connection with the preceding clause, "and on the side-rooms of the temple," as there is no necessity to repeat the preposition in the case of closely continuous clauses (vid., Ewald, 351a); and the side-rooms not only must have had windows, but might also be ornamented with figures of palms. But if the words be taken in this sense, the &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; must also signify something which presented, like the walls of the porch and of the side chambers, a considerable extent of surface capable of receiving a similar decoration; although nothing definite has hitherto been ascertained with regard to the meaning of the word, and our rendering "beams" makes no pretension to correctness. </body></html>
