For which reason St. Jerome, upon the place, supposes the following words to express the proportion the people ought to pay the Levites out of the increase of their ground; which by their rabbins was determined to amount to at least a sixtieth part: after which separation a tenth part was to be paid out of the remainder. The portions allotted to the priests and Levites were not intended only for their own maintenance; but likewise to make a constant provision for those sacrifices, both ordinary and extraordinary, which were appointed by the law: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-10.htm" title="Bring you all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house, and prove me now herewith, said the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.">Malachi 3:10</a>. <span class="ital">And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred — </span>This offering is enjoined, besides the setting apart the firstborn for the use of the priests and Levites, for making provision for the daily burnt-offering, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm" title="And you shall say to them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.">Numbers 28:3</a>, and for burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, or sacrifices of thanksgiving, that were to be made upon proper occasions. <span class="ital">Out of the fat pastures of Israel — </span>This implies that these lambs were to be the best and fattest of their kind, as all other tithes and things dedicated to God were to be. <span class="ital">To make reconciliation for them</span> — This effect is ascribed to burnt-offerings, as well as to those which were properly sacrificed for sin. <span class="ital">All the people, &c., shall give this oblation for the prince </span>— Or, <span class="ital">with the prince; </span>that is, the people shall join with the prince in making these oblations; whereas those that follow in the next verse are to be at the sole charge of the prince.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The offerings. to be made by the people through the prince for the service of the sanctuary.

These oblations should be made for the maintenance of the necessary sacrificial worship in the new temple, for the meal, burnt, and peace or thank offerings that should there be presented to make reconciliation or atonement for the house of Israel. Compared with the offerings prescribed by the Law of Moses, these discover important variations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Of flour, the Law demanded one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour with a lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>), with a ram two-tenths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-6.htm">Numbers 15:6</a>), with a bullock three-tenths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-9.htm">Numbers 15:9</a>); of wheat and of barley Ezekiel's <span class="accented">Torah re</span>quires one-sixteenth of an ephah for each, i.e. one-third in all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Of oil, the Mosaic ordinance was, with a lamb should be presented one-fourth of a bin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one-twenty-fourth of a bath; with a ram, one-third of a bin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one-eighteenth of a bath; with a bullock one-half of a hin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one-twelfth of a bath.

Thus the demands of Ezekiel's Torah surpass those of the earlier or Mosaic Torah in quantity as well as quality. That these demands are definitely specified does not prove they should partake rather of the nature of a tax than of a free-will offering. That they were not to be regarded as taxes is shown by the absence of any allusion to penalties for neglect of payment; that they were designed to be looked upon as free-will offerings is plain from the circumstance that Jehovah never supposes for a moment that these generous offerings will be withheld; and perhaps all that is really signified by them is that the liberality of Jehovah's people in the future age should greatly exceed that which had been practiced at any former time. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Separate Place, and the External Dimensions of the Temple<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>. And the building at the front of the separate place was seventy cubits broad on the side turned toward the west, and the wall of the building five cubits broad round about, and its length ninety cubits. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a>. And he measured the (temple) house: the length a hundred cubits; and the separate place, and its building, and its walls: the length a hundred cubits. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-14.htm">Ezekiel 41:14</a>. And the breadth of the face of the (temple) house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits. - The explanation of these verses depends upon the meaning of the word &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;. According to its derivation from &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, to cut, to separate, &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; means that which is cut off, or separated. Thus &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is the land cut off, the desert, which is not connected by roads with the inhabited country. In the passage before us, &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; signifies a place on the western side of the temple, i.e., behind the temple, which was separated from the sanctuary (Plate I J), and on which a building stood, but concerning the purpose of which nothing more definite is stated than we are able to gather, partly from the name and situation of the place in question, and partly from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>, according to which, even in Solomon's temple, there was a similar space at the back of the temple house with buildings upon it, which had a separate way out, the gate &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;, namely, that "this space,with its buildings, was to be used for the reception of all refuse, sweepings, all kinds of rubbish, - in brief, of everything that was separated or rejected when the holy service was performed in the temple, - and that this was the reason why it received the name of the separate place" (Kliefoth). The building upon this space was situated &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, in the front of the gizrah (that is to say, as one approached it from the temple); and that &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, on the side of the way to the sea, i.e., on the western side, sc. of the temple, and had a breadth of seventy cubits (from north to south), with a wall round about, which was five cubits broad (thick), and a length of ninety cubits. As the thickness of the wall is specially mentioned in connection with the breadth, we must add it both to the breadth and to the length of the building as given here; so that, when looked at from the outside, the building was eighty cubits broad and a hundred cubits long. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a> this length is expressly attributed to the separate place, and (i.e., along with) its building, and the walls thereof. But the length of the temple house has also been previously stated as a hundred cubits. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-14.htm">Ezekiel 41:14</a> the breadth of both is also stated to have been a hundred cubits - namely, the breadth of the outer front, or front face of the temple, was a hundred cubits; and the breadth of the separate place &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; toward the east, i.e., the breadth which it showed to the person measuring on the eastern side, was the same. If, them, the building on the separate place was only eighty cubits broad, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>, including the walls, whilst the separate place itself was a hundred cubits broad, there remains a space of twenty cubits in breadth not covered by the building; that is to say, as we need not hesitate to put the building in the centre, open spaces of ten cubits each on the northern and southern sides were left as approaches to the building on both sides (K), whereas the entire length of the separate place (from east to west) was covered by the building. - All these measurements are in perfect harmony. As the inner court formed a square of a hundred cubits in length (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>), the temple house, which joined it on the west, extended with its appurtenances to a similar length; and the separate place behind the temple also covered a space of equal size. These three squares, therefore, had a length from east to west of three hundred cubits. If we add to this the length of the buildings of the east gates of the inner and outer courts, namely fifty cubits for each (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-15.htm">Ezekiel 40:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-29.htm">Ezekiel 40:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-33.htm">Ezekiel 40:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-36.htm">Ezekiel 40:36</a>), and the length of the outer court from gate to gate a hundred cubits (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>), we obtain for the whole of the temple building the length of five hundred cubits. If, again, we add to the breadth of the inner court or temple house, which was one hundred cubits, the breadths of the outer court, with the outer and inner gate-buildings, viz., two hundred cubits on both the north and south sides, we obtain a total breadth of 100 + 200 + 200  equals  500 (say five hundred) cubits; so that the whole building covered a space of five hundred cubits square, in harmony with the calculation already made (at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-24.htm">Ezekiel 40:24-27</a>) of the size of the surrounding wall. </body></html>
