The words are, literally, <span class= "ital">I saw for the house a height </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> an elevation) <span class= "ital">round about,</span> and the meaning of this is explained in what follows. The Temple, as has been already said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm" title="The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.">Ezekiel 40:49</a>), was entered by a flight of steps leading up to the porch, and was therefore on a higher level than the court. We are now told that the side chambers had a foundation of six cubits. Whether this “foundation” of the Temple and the side chambers was built of masonry, or, as is more probable, was a sort of basement to contain cisterns and storage rooms, we are not told; but it probably extended, under the name of “the place that was left” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-9.htm" title="The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.">Ezekiel 41:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-11.htm" title="And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.">Ezekiel 41:11</a>), five cubits beyond the outer wall of the chambers, forming a platform from which they were entered.<p><span class= "bld">Six great cubits.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">six cubits to the joint,</span> or <span class= "ital">to the armpit,</span> for the word has both significations. It is plain that a cubit of a different length, measured to the armpit, cannot be intended, both because no such cubit is known to have been in use at any time, and because Ezekiel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm" title="And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.">Ezekiel 40:5</a> has already fixed the length of the cubit he uses. The sense of <span class= "ital">joint</span> is therefore to be taken, and this applied architecturally can only mean the point at which one part of the building joins another; here, the point where the superstructure meets the foundation, or, as we should say, “six cubits to the water-table.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/41.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>41:1-26 After the prophet had observed the courts, he was brought to the temple.

"Tern. pel Salerno"), <span class="cmt_word">upon a height</span> - or, <span class="accented">raised basement</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">round about</span>, which agrees with the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a> that the temple was approached by means of a stair. In consequence of this, the foundations of the side chambers were <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">full reed of six great cubits</span>; or, <span class="accented">of six cubits to the joining</span> (Revised Version); "six cubits to the story" (Ewald); literally, <span class="accented">six cubits to the armpit</span>. This can hardly mean six cubits each equal to the distance from the elbow to the wrist, which would be a new definition of the length of the reed; but as Havernick and Kliefoth propose, must be taken as an architectural term indicative of the point where one portion of the building joined on to another. Accordingly, by most interpreters the six cubits are considered to be a statement of the height of the ceiling above the floor in each story, which would give an elevation of eighteen cubits for the three stories; but probably they mark only the height of the temple and side chamber basis above the ground. Kliefoth includes both views, and obtains an altitude of twenty-four cubits from the ground to the temple roof. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Account of the motive by which Gog was induced to undertake his warlike expedition, and incurred guilt, notwithstanding the fact that he was led by God, and in consequence of which he brought upon himself the judgment of destruction that was about to fall upon him. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-10.htm">Ezekiel 38:10</a>.

Gog resolves to fall upon Israel, now living in peace and security, and dwelling in open unfortified places, and to rob and plunder it. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; , literally, land of plains, i.e., a land which has no fortified towns, but only places lying quite exposed (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>); because its inhabitants are living in undisturbed peace and safe repose, and therefore dwell in places that have no walls with gates and bars (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>). This description of Israel's mode of life also points beyond the times succeeding the Babylonian captivity to the Messianic days, when the Lord will have destroyed the horses and war-chariots and fortresses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), and Jerusalem will be inhabited as an open country because of the multitude of the men and cattle, and the Lord will be a wall of fire round about her (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8-9</a>). For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>. &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; is not dependent upon &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, like the preceding infinitives, but is subordinate to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;: "thou sayest, I will go up...to turn thy hand." &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to bring back, is to be explained from the fact that the heathen had already at an earlier period turned their hand against the towns of Israel, and plundered their possessions and goods. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; in this connection are desolate places which are inhabited again, and therefore have been rebuilt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19</a>). &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; are synonyms; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; does not mean flocks or herds, but gain, possession (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-6.htm">Genesis 36:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-18.htm">Genesis 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-23.htm">Genesis 34:23</a>). One motive of Gog for making the attack was to be found in the possessions of Israel; a second is given in the words: who dwell upon the navel of the earth. This figurative expression is to be explained from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-5.htm">Ezekiel 5:5</a> : "Jerusalem in the midst of the nations." This navel is not a figure denoting the high land, but signifies the land situated in the middle of the earth, and therefore the land most glorious and most richly blessed; so that they who dwell there occupy the most exalted position among the nations. A covetous desire for the possessions of the people of God, and envy at his exalted position in the centre of the world, are therefore the motives by which Gog is impelled to enter upon his predatory expedition against the people living in the depth of peace. This covetousness is so great, that even the rich trading populations of Sabaea, Dedan, and Tarshish (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>) perceive it, and declare that it is this alone which has determined Gog to undertake his expedition. The words of these peoples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-13.htm">Ezekiel 38:13</a>) are not to be taken as expressing their sympathies (Kliefoth), but serve to give prominence to the obvious thirst for booty which characterizes the multitude led by Gog. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, their young lions, are the rapacious rulers of these trading communities, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a> introduces the announcement of the punishment, which consists of another summary account of the daring enterprise of Gog and his hosts (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4-9</a>), and a clear statement of the design of God in leading him against His people and land. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, close), of which different renderings have been given, does not mean, thou wilt experience, or be aware of, the punishment; but the object is to be taken from the context: thou wilt know, or perceive, sc. that Israel dwells securely, not expecting any hostile invasion.
