The side-chambers of Solomon's Temple were built against the temple-wall, but in Ezekiel's vision the desire to keep the temple still more separate and holy led to a fresh arrangement, namely, that another wall should be built at such a distance from the temple-wall as to allow of chambers being built against it, facing the temple-wall, and opening into a passage or corridor (F), separating them from the temple itself.<p>That they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house - that they might have hold but not have hold on the wall of the house, i. e., entirely separating the chambers from the temple-wall proper. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. might &#8230; hold, but &#8230; not hold in &#8230; wall of the house&#8212;1Ki 6:6 tells us there were rests made in the walls of the temple for supports to the side chambers; but the temple walls did not thereby become part of this side building; they stood separate from it.

There were three stories of them, and thirty in every storey, in all ninety; there were such chambers round about Solomon's temple, and so many stories of them, though their number is not expressed, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>, but Josephus (z) says they were thirty, and one above another, three stories of them, as here. Some think twelve were on the north side, twelve on the south, and six on the west; or fifteen on the north, and fifteen on the south. The Misnic doctors (a) say there were thirty eight in the second temple, fifteen on the north side, fifteen on the south, and eight on the west. The Targum is, <p>"the chambers were chamber over chamber thirty three, eleven in a row;'' <p>and so some (b) understand it, that they were in all but thirty three, eleven in the first storey, as many in the second, and the same number in the third; and place them four in the north, four in the south, and three in the west, so Starckius; but the first account seems best. This denotes the number of churches in Gospel times, especially in the latter day; when there will be large conversions, and room enough for all the converts: and as there are many mansions in heaven for all the saints; so there will be room enough in the New Jerusalem, the more perfect state of the church on earth, to hold the whole palm bearing company, whose number no man can number; and all the nations of them that are saved, who will walk in the light of it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, <p>and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house; the beams of the floors of those side chambers rested indeed upon the wall of the house which was built for them; but were not inserted into it, or laid in it, as we see in some buildings; but there were projections or buttresses in the wall, or what are called narrowed rests, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a> or rebatements of the breadth of a cubit, on which they were laid and rested; and so it was in the upper stories, as in the lowermost; there being an abatement of a cubit in the thickness of the wall in each storey, as in the following verse. This shows the firmness of this spiritual building resting upon such a wall and such buttresses as God himself is to it; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a>. <p>(z) Antiqu. l. 8. c. 3. sect. 2.((a) Misn.

The Heb. would naturally read: “and the side-chambers were side-chamber against side-chamber three and thirty times”—which would give 33 chambers. Apart from syntax this is not probable. LXX. and some other versions give a different order: “and the side-chambers, side-chamber against side-chamber, were thirty, three times” (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/7-4.htm" title="And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks....">1 Kings 7:4-5</a>). It is probable that the chambers were thirty; those in the outer court were also thirty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm" title="Then brought he me into the outward court, and, see, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were on the pavement.">Ezekiel 40:17</a>), and Josephus is cited as witness for this number (Boett., Corn.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wall … of the house for the side chambers</span>] It must not of course be supposed that the house had two walls,—a separate one for the chambers. The word “entered into” must either be taken as a noun: <span class="ital">and there were intakes in the wall of the house for the side chambers;</span> or it must be altered into some other word having this sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-6.htm" title="The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.">1 Kings 6:6</a>, LXX. uses the same word here as there)—<span class="ital">and there were rebatements</span> &c.; or some word of this meaning has fallen out before “entered into.” LXX. has rendered the word “times,” doubly, “thrice” “twice.” If the word “times,” lit. <span class="ital">steps</span>, could have the required meaning of intakes, it might be supposed that being written twice it had fallen out. But this is doubtful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">might have hold</span>] It is self-evident that the second and third stories must have been supported in some way by the wall of the house, which was their own wall on one side, and mere contact with a perpendicular wall could be no support.

It is not needful to alter the text, as Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, and Ewald propose to do, in order to make it read, with the LXX., "chamber against chamber, thirty and (this) three times," on the ground that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is the preposition, because in Ezekiel <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> often stands for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>). How the chambers were arranged along the three sides is not stated; but most likely there were twelve threes on each of the longer sides, the north and the south, and six threes on the shorter or western side. Like the chambers in Solomon's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>). those in Ezekiel's were not fastened to "the wall of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the temple proper; the only question is whether they were built against the temple wall, as Kliefoth, Keil, Smend, and Schroder suppose, or, as Ewald and Dr. Currey seem to think, against another wall, five cubits thick (ver. 9), which ran parallel to the temple wall, and which, having been built expressly for the support of the side chambers, might properly enough be said to be "of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> belonging to it. In the former case the chambers would doubtless be fastened to the temple wall by means of "ledges," "holds," "rebates," as in the temple of Solomon: in the latter case, as Ewald translates, there would be "a light passage between the wall of the house and the side chambers around." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Account of the motive by which Gog was induced to undertake his warlike expedition, and incurred guilt, notwithstanding the fact that he was led by God, and in consequence of which he brought upon himself the judgment of destruction that was about to fall upon him. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-10.htm">Ezekiel 38:10</a>.

What things these are, we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>; but first of all, these things are described as evil thoughts or designs. Gog resolves to fall upon Israel, now living in peace and security, and dwelling in open unfortified places, and to rob and plunder it. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; , literally, land of plains, i.e., a land which has no fortified towns, but only places lying quite exposed (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>); because its inhabitants are living in undisturbed peace and safe repose, and therefore dwell in places that have no walls with gates and bars (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>). This description of Israel's mode of life also points beyond the times succeeding the Babylonian captivity to the Messianic days, when the Lord will have destroyed the horses and war-chariots and fortresses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), and Jerusalem will be inhabited as an open country because of the multitude of the men and cattle, and the Lord will be a wall of fire round about her (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8-9</a>). For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>. &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; is not dependent upon &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, like the preceding infinitives, but is subordinate to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;: "thou sayest, I will go up...to turn thy hand." &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to bring back, is to be explained from the fact that the heathen had already at an earlier period turned their hand against the towns of Israel, and plundered their possessions and goods. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; in this connection are desolate places which are inhabited again, and therefore have been rebuilt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19</a>). &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; are synonyms; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; does not mean flocks or herds, but gain, possession (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-6.htm">Genesis 36:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-18.htm">Genesis 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-23.htm">Genesis 34:23</a>). One motive of Gog for making the attack was to be found in the possessions of Israel; a second is given in the words: who dwell upon the navel of the earth. This figurative expression is to be explained from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-5.htm">Ezekiel 5:5</a> : "Jerusalem in the midst of the nations." This navel is not a figure denoting the high land, but signifies the land situated in the middle of the earth, and therefore the land most glorious and most richly blessed; so that they who dwell there occupy the most exalted position among the nations. A covetous desire for the possessions of the people of God, and envy at his exalted position in the centre of the world, are therefore the motives by which Gog is impelled to enter upon his predatory expedition against the people living in the depth of peace. This covetousness is so great, that even the rich trading populations of Sabaea, Dedan, and Tarshish (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>) perceive it, and declare that it is this alone which has determined Gog to undertake his expedition. The words of these peoples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-13.htm">Ezekiel 38:13</a>) are not to be taken as expressing their sympathies (Kliefoth), but serve to give prominence to the obvious thirst for booty which characterizes the multitude led by Gog. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, their young lions, are the rapacious rulers of these trading communities, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a> introduces the announcement of the punishment, which consists of another summary account of the daring enterprise of Gog and his hosts (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4-9</a>), and a clear statement of the design of God in leading him against His people and land. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, close), of which different renderings have been given, does not mean, thou wilt experience, or be aware of, the punishment; but the object is to be taken from the context: thou wilt know, or perceive, sc. that Israel dwells securely, not expecting any hostile invasion. The rendering of the lxx (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;) does not furnish any satisfactory ground for altering &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; into &#1514;&#1506;&#1512;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512; (Ewald, Hitzig).
