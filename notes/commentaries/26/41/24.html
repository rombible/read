At it, not at the table of showbread, the priests daily ministered. It stood in front of the veil, and is therefore said to be "before the Lord." It is called a table, as being that at which the Lord will take delight in His people, as at a feast.

General announcement of his destruction. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1</a>. And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with thee, Gog, thou prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>. I will mislead thee, and conduct thee, and cause thee to come up from the uttermost north, and bring thee to the mountains of Israel; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-3.htm">Ezekiel 39:3</a>. And will smite thy bow from thy left hand, and cause thine arrows to fall from thy right hand. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-4.htm">Ezekiel 39:4</a>. Upon the mountains of Israel wilt thou fall, thou and all thy hosts, and the peoples which are with thee: I give thee for food to the birds of prey of every plumage, and to the beasts of the field. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-5.htm">Ezekiel 39:5</a>. Upon the open field shalt thou fall, for I have spoken it, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>. And I will send fire in Magog, and among those who dwell in security upon the islands, that they may know that I am Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>. I will make known my holy name in the midst of my people Israel, and will not let my holy name be profaned any more, that the nations may know that I am Jehovah, holy in Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-8.htm">Ezekiel 39:8</a>. Behold, it comes and happens, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah; this is the day of which I spoke. - The further description of the judgment with which Gog and his hosts are threatened in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-21.htm">Ezekiel 38:21-23</a>, commences with a repetition of the command to the prophet to prophesy against Gog (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2-3</a>). The principal contents of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4-15</a> are then briefly summed up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>, is strengthened by &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.., is not connected with &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; in the sense of "I leave a sixth part of thee remaining," or afflict thee with six punishments; but in the Ethiopic it signifies to proceed, or to climb, and here, accordingly, it is used in the sense of leading on (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;, or, according to another reading, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;; Vulg. educam). For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-8.htm">Ezekiel 38:8</a>. In the land of Israel, God will strike his weapons out of his hands, i.e., make him incapable of fighting (for the fact itself, compare the similar figures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-15.htm">Psalm 37:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>), and give him up with all his army as a prey to death. &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, a beast of prey, is more precisely defined by &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, and still further strengthened by the genitive &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;: birds of prey of every kind. The judgment will not be confined to the destruction of the army of Gog, which has invaded the land of Israel, but (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>) will also extend to the land of Gog, and to all the heathen nations that are dwelling in security. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, fire, primarily the fire of war; then, in a further sense, a figure denoting destruction inflicted directly by God, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>, which is therefore represented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a> as fire falling from heaven. Magog is the population of the land of Magog (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2</a>). With this the inhabitants of the distant coastlands of the west (the &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;) are associated, as representatives of the remotest heathen nations. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-8.htm">Ezekiel 39:8</a>. By this judgment the Lord will make known His holy name in Israel, and show the heathen that He will not let it be blasphemed by them any more.
