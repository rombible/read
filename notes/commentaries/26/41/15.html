The prophet proceeds now to describe the interior of the house in two particular points: (1) the woodwork with which the house in its walls, &c., was covered, 15<span class="ital">b</span>–16 <span class="ital">a</span>; and (2) the ornamentation of this woodwork, 16 <span class="ital">b seq</span>. The text is in some disorder, and the unknown term rendered “galleries” causes perplexity, though two general statements are plainly made, viz. that the whole interior of the house was covered with wood, and that this woodwork from floor to roof was ornamented in the holy place and in the holiest with cherubs and palms (in the porch perhaps with palms only). With no more changes than are absolutely necessary <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-15.htm" title="And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;">Ezekiel 41:15</a></span> <span class="ital">b</span>–16 <span class="ital">a</span> might read: “and the temple (i.e. holy place), and the inner house (holiest), and the porch of the court (more probably, and its outer porch), 16 and the thresholds, and the closed windows and the galleries round about the three of them, opposite the threshold (i.e. towards the interior) were veneered with wood (or, were polished wood) round about.” This would state generally that the whole interior was wainscotted. But the jump from “thresholds” (A.V. door-posts) to “closed windows” in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-16.htm" title="The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, paneled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;">Ezekiel 41:16</a></span> is unnatural. It is probable that “thresholds” should be read with LXX. <span class="ital">cieled</span> (or, wainscotted). It is certainly probable that the roofing is described; the word read by LXX. (saphan) is always used of the roof-work in the description of Solomon’s temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-7.htm" title="And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.">1 Kings 6:7</a>., unless <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-7.htm" title="The morning is come to you, O you that dwell in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.">Ezekiel 7:7</a> be an exception, a clause wanting in LXX.); and LXX. understood it so here (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-20.htm" title="From the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.">Ezekiel 41:20</a></span>). Further the mention of the closed windows, which must have been toward the roof, in immediate connexion, is in favour of the roof-work. What the “galleries” were is obscure. LXX. either did not read the word or rendered it “narrow openings” (slit windows). A.V. “on their three stories” should be <span class="bld">to the three of them</span> (the holy place, holiest and porch, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-15.htm" title="And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;">Ezekiel 41:15</a></span>). Pointed thus the reading is: <span class="ital">and the temple and the inner house</span> (holiest) <span class="ital">and the porch of the court</span> (or, and its outer porch) <span class="ital">were covered with a roof-work, and they three had their closed windows and their galleries round about</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - With this verse begins a summary of measurements of which some have been already given, while others are new.

The <span class="accented">ethekim</span> were most likely passages or perches running along both (north and south) sides of the building, and supported either by pillars or ledges in the wall. The inner temple, which was measured, was the "house" which stood between the gizrah and the inner court; the porches of the court were the gate buildings in the inner and outer courts. Of all these the dimensions have already been reported, and are not again rehearsed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Announcement of the Wrathful Judgment upon Gog, as a Proof of the Holiness of the Lord<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-17.htm">Ezekiel 38:17</a>.

And will prove myself great and holy, and will make myself known before the eyes of many nations, that they may know that I am Jehovah. - The announcement of the way in which the Lord will sanctify Himself upon Gog (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>) commences with the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-17.htm">Ezekiel 38:17</a>, that Gog is he of whom God has already spoken by the earlier prophets. This assertion is clothed in the form of a question: &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, not &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, which is the interrogative form used for an emphatic assurance; whereas &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; does not set down the point in question as indisputably certain, but suggests the inquiry for the purpose of giving a definite answer. The affirmative reply to the question asked is contained in the last clause of the verse: "to bring thee upon them;" so that &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; really means, thou art truly he. The statement, that Gog is he of whom God had already spoken by the earlier prophets, does not mean that those prophets had actually mentioned Gog, but simply that Gog was the enemy of whose rising up against the people of God the prophets of the former time had prophesied, as well as of his destruction by a wrathful judgment of the Lord. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (for years, or years long) is an accusative of measure, not asyndeton to ba&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, as the lxx and many of the commentators down to Hvernick have taken it to be. The design of this remark is not to accredit the prophecy by referring to the utterances of earlier prophets, but to show that the attack of the peoples gathered together by Gog, upon the land and people of the Lord, is not an unexpected event, or one at variance with the promise of the restoration of Israel as a kingdom of peace. To what utterances of the older prophets these words refer is a question difficult to answer. Zechariah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-2.htm">Zechariah 12:2-3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2-3</a>) is of course not to be thought of, as Zechariah himself did not prophesy till after the captivity, and therefore not till after Ezekiel. But we may recall <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/4-2.htm">Joel 4:2</a> and 11ff.; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-21.htm">Ezekiel 26:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23</a> and 25; and, in fact, all the earlier prophets who prophesied of Jehovah's day of judgment upon all the heathen.<p>(Note: Aug. Kueper (Jeremias librr. sacrr., interpr. atque vindex, p. 82) has correctly observed concerning this verse, that "it is evident enough that there is no reference here to prophecies concerning Gog and Magog, which have been lost; but those general prophecies, which are met with on every hand directed against the enemies of the church, are here referred to Gog." And before him, J. F. Starck had already said: "In my opinion, we are to understand all those passages in the prophets which treat of the enemies of the church and its persecutions...these afflictions were preludes and shadows of the bloody persecution of Gog.")<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-19.htm">Ezekiel 38:19</a> do not contain words which Jehovah spoke through the ancient prophets, and which Ezekiel now transfers to Gog and the time of his appearing (Hitzig and Kliefoth). The perfect &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-19.htm">Ezekiel 38:19</a> by no means warrants such an assumption; for this is purely prophetic, expressing the certainty of the divine determination as a thing clearly proved.

For the anthropopathetic expression, "my wrath ascends in my nose," compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, "smoke ascends in His nose." The outburst of wrath shows itself in the vehement breath which the wrathful man inhales and exhales through his nose (see the comm. on the Psalm, l.c.). The bursting out of the wrath of God is literally explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-19.htm">Ezekiel 38:19</a>. In the jealousy of His wrath God has spoken, i.e., determined, to inflict a great trembling upon the land of Israel. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>) is strengthened by &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-36.htm">Ezekiel 21:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-21.htm">Ezekiel 22:21</a>). The trembling which will come upon the land of Israel, so that all creatures in the sea, in the air, and upon the ground, tremble before Jehovah (&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;), who appears to judgment, will rise in nature into an actual earthquake, which overthrows mountains, hills, and walls. &#1502;&#1491;&#1512;&#1490;&#1493;&#1514; are steep heights, which can only be ascended by steps (Sol 2:14). This picture of the trembling of the whole world, with all the creatures, before the Lord who is coming to judgment, both here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/4-16.htm">Joel 4:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4-5</a>, rests upon the fact which actually occurred in connection with the revelation of God upon Sinai, when the whole mountain was made to quake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>.). The inhabitants of the land of Israel tremble at the terrible phenomena attending the revelation of the wrath of God, although the wrathful judgment does not apply to them, but to their enemies, Gog and his hosts. The Lord calls the sword against Gog, that his hosts may wound and slay one another. This feature of the destruction of the enemy by wounds inflicted by itself, which we meet with again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-13.htm">Zechariah 14:13</a>, has its typical exemplar in the defeat of the Midianites in the time of Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>), and also in that of the enemy invading Judah in the reign of Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>). In &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497; the &#1500; is not distributive, but indicates the direction: "to all my mountains." The overthrow of the enemy is intensified by marvellous plagues inflicted by God - pestilence and blood (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-23.htm">Ezekiel 28:23</a>), torrents of rain and hailstones (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>), and the raining of fire and brimstone upon Gog, as formerly upon Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>). - Thus will Jehovah prove Himself to be the almighty God by judgment upon His enemies, and sanctify Himself before all the nations (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a>). </body></html>
