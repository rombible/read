At it, not at the table of showbread, the priests daily ministered. It stood in front of the veil, and is therefore said to be "before the Lord." It is called a table, as being that at which the Lord will take delight in His people, as at a feast.

Again as in the Solomonic edifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>, etc.), the holy place and the holy of holies had two doors; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> each had one door composed of two turning (or, folding) leaves, ornamented, like the walls of the house, with carvings of cherubim and palms. On the face of the porch without were <span class="cmt_word">thick planks</span>, by which Ewald understands "foliage" or "leafwork," but which, with greater likelihood, were either as Keil renders, "moldings of wood" for the threshold; or "cornicings," as Kliefoth translates; if not, as Smend suggests, projecting beams to afford shelter to one standing in the porch; or as Hengstenberg and Plumptre say, "steps." The last verse states that narrow or closed (as in ver. 16) windows admitted light into the porch, while carvings of palm trees adorned its walls on each side. The cherubic figures, Plumptre hints, were absent, because the porch was a place of less sanctity than the temple. Hengstenberg notes that the words, "thick planks," "thick beams," or "steps," as he translates, fitly close this description, "as placing the extreme east over against the extreme west with which it began." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/39.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Further Description of the Judgment to Fall upon Gog and his Hosts<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1-8</a>. General announcement of his destruction. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1</a>. And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with thee, Gog, thou prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>. I will mislead thee, and conduct thee, and cause thee to come up from the uttermost north, and bring thee to the mountains of Israel; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-3.htm">Ezekiel 39:3</a>. And will smite thy bow from thy left hand, and cause thine arrows to fall from thy right hand. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-4.htm">Ezekiel 39:4</a>. Upon the mountains of Israel wilt thou fall, thou and all thy hosts, and the peoples which are with thee: I give thee for food to the birds of prey of every plumage, and to the beasts of the field. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-5.htm">Ezekiel 39:5</a>. Upon the open field shalt thou fall, for I have spoken it, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>. And I will send fire in Magog, and among those who dwell in security upon the islands, that they may know that I am Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>.

Behold, it comes and happens, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah; this is the day of which I spoke. - The further description of the judgment with which Gog and his hosts are threatened in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-21.htm">Ezekiel 38:21-23</a>, commences with a repetition of the command to the prophet to prophesy against Gog (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2-3</a>).

For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-8.htm">Ezekiel 38:8</a>. In the land of Israel, God will strike his weapons out of his hands, i.e., make him incapable of fighting (for the fact itself, compare the similar figures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-15.htm">Psalm 37:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>), and give him up with all his army as a prey to death. &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, a beast of prey, is more precisely defined by &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, and still further strengthened by the genitive &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;: birds of prey of every kind. The judgment will not be confined to the destruction of the army of Gog, which has invaded the land of Israel, but (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>) will also extend to the land of Gog, and to all the heathen nations that are dwelling in security. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, fire, primarily the fire of war; then, in a further sense, a figure denoting destruction inflicted directly by God, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>, which is therefore represented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a> as fire falling from heaven. Magog is the population of the land of Magog (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2</a>). With this the inhabitants of the distant coastlands of the west (the &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;) are associated, as representatives of the remotest heathen nations. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-8.htm">Ezekiel 39:8</a>. By this judgment the Lord will make known His holy name in Israel, and show the heathen that He will not let it be blasphemed by them any more.
