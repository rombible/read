The main facts are clear: that there was an increase in the width of each storey of the side chambers by the distance which the wall receded, as is expressly said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-6.htm" title="The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.">1Kings 6:6</a>; but whether there was a corresponding recession in the thickness of the outer wall of the chambers is not stated. It is also plain that the side chambers surrounded the house; and that the two upper storeys were reached by a winding staircase (w [<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/40-44.htm" title="And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.">Ezekiel 40:44-49</a>]).

These chambers, as they rose up in stories one above another, were larger and larger; those in the middlemost storey were larger than those in the lower storey by a cubit; so much being taken out of the thickness of the wall, to make the rests or rebatements for the beams of the floor to rest upon, by which so much was gained in breadth for the chambers; and those in the upper storey, for the same reason, were a cubit broader than those in the middle, and two cubits broader than the lowermost; the floor of the first and lower storey was four cubits broad, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a> the floor of the second five cubits; and the floor of the third or uppermost six cubits. The wall of the temple at the bottom was six cubits thick, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a>, at the middlemost storey five cubits; and at the uppermost four: and all this may denote the enlargement of the church of Christ, as it comes nearer the heavenly state; the present state of the church may be signified by the lower storey, where the chambers are narrowest; the state of the church in the latter day glory, or spiritual reign of Christ, by the middlemost, when it will be enlarged; its converts being very numerous, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19</a> and the New Jerusalem church state by the uppermost storey; which city or state will be very large, and next to heaven, or the ultimate glory; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>. The "winding" that went upwards to the side chambers were winding stairs, which went up from one storey to another, higher and higher; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a>. The Misnic doctors say (c), that in the second temple these winding stairs went from one side of the temple to the other, from the north east to the northwest; by which they went up to the roofs of these chambers and to the upper room over the sanctuary. These may signify the various afflictions and tribulations, trials and exercises, in which the Lord leads his people, and by which the churches of Christ pass from one state to another: <p>for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: not on the outside, but within; properly round about the chambers, which are here called the house: <p>therefore the breadth of the house was still upward; became broader and broader, as it rose up higher and higher: <p>and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst; from being only four cubits broad in the lowest storey, it became five cubits in the middlemost, and from thence six cubits in the highest. <p>(c) Misn.

What the verse means to say is that the side-chambers widened in the second and third stories through the retreating of the wall of the house. The present text being assumed it might read: “and there was a widening of the side-chambers and an encompassing (by them) ever upwards; for the encompassing of the house was (the more) ever upwards, round about the house”—the meaning being that the higher the three story building rose the broader it grew and the closer it encompassed the house, i.e. appeared to encroach upon the house owing to the retreat of the wall. Another sense of the present reading would be got if the word rendered “encompass” could be supposed to be something which the house did, viz. “turn,” turn in, retreat. The sense would remain the same. LXX. omits “encompassing” after “widening” and instead of “for the encompassing” &c. it reads: <span class="ital">according to the appendage</span> (projection, i.e. the ledge) <span class="ital">out of the wall</span>—giving the same general meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the breadth of the house</span>] The words mean: the house became broader upwards—an impossible sense. Either “house” must be omitted with LXX., or the clause read: and it broadened toward the house (or, inwards) ever upward. Subject is the side building.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and so increased</span>] The words state how the various stories communicated with one another, according to the clear statement, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-8.htm" title="The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.">1 Kings 6:8</a>. Read: <span class="bld">and from the lowest one went up to the highest and to the middle story</span>, or possibly with R.V., <span class="ital">by</span> the middle story. LXX. perspicuously: that they might go up from the chambers below to the upper chambers, and from the middle chambers to the third story. Syr. is equally distinct.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In the side chambers <span class="cmt_word">an enlarging</span> took place as they went up, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the floorage of the second story exceeded that of the first, and the floorage of the third that of the second; though how this was effected can only be conjectured. If the chambers were built against the temple wall, then probably the wall at each story went in, say a cubit or a cubit and a half from the outside, so as to admit the beams; or, if the chambers were built against an outside wall, a similar recession of the wall from the inside may have taken place. In either ease, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> (interior) <span class="cmt_word">breadth of the house</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the side chambers, would be <span class="cmt_word">upward</span>, and would increase from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. Plumptre, after Kliefoth, suggests that the increasing size of the chambers in the three stories may have been due to projecting galleries. Ewald, taking "house" as "the temple," supposes that it gradually became bigger. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> broader, as it rose, which could be the case only if the side chambers were built against the temple wall, and the increased width of the stories was scoured By projecting galleries or corridors. Greater obscurity attaches to the second clause, <span class="cmt_word">and a winding about still upward to the side chambers</span>, which the Authorized Version and some expositors regard as an indication that Ezekiel's temple had a spiral staircase like that in Solomon's temple (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a>); and probably some such mode of passing from story to story did exist in Ezekiel's temple; yet the clause, when properly rendered, does not refer to this. The Revised Version reads, "And the side chambers were broader as they encompassed <span class="accented">the house</span> higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house; therefore the breadth of the house <span class="accented">continued</span> upward; and so one went up (most likely by a spiral stair) from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Account of the motive by which Gog was induced to undertake his warlike expedition, and incurred guilt, notwithstanding the fact that he was led by God, and in consequence of which he brought upon himself the judgment of destruction that was about to fall upon him. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-10.htm">Ezekiel 38:10</a>.

Gog resolves to fall upon Israel, now living in peace and security, and dwelling in open unfortified places, and to rob and plunder it. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; , literally, land of plains, i.e., a land which has no fortified towns, but only places lying quite exposed (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>); because its inhabitants are living in undisturbed peace and safe repose, and therefore dwell in places that have no walls with gates and bars (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>). This description of Israel's mode of life also points beyond the times succeeding the Babylonian captivity to the Messianic days, when the Lord will have destroyed the horses and war-chariots and fortresses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), and Jerusalem will be inhabited as an open country because of the multitude of the men and cattle, and the Lord will be a wall of fire round about her (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8-9</a>). For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>. &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; is not dependent upon &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, like the preceding infinitives, but is subordinate to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;: "thou sayest, I will go up...to turn thy hand." &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to bring back, is to be explained from the fact that the heathen had already at an earlier period turned their hand against the towns of Israel, and plundered their possessions and goods. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; in this connection are desolate places which are inhabited again, and therefore have been rebuilt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19</a>). &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; are synonyms; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; does not mean flocks or herds, but gain, possession (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-6.htm">Genesis 36:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-18.htm">Genesis 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-23.htm">Genesis 34:23</a>). One motive of Gog for making the attack was to be found in the possessions of Israel; a second is given in the words: who dwell upon the navel of the earth. This figurative expression is to be explained from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-5.htm">Ezekiel 5:5</a> : "Jerusalem in the midst of the nations." This navel is not a figure denoting the high land, but signifies the land situated in the middle of the earth, and therefore the land most glorious and most richly blessed; so that they who dwell there occupy the most exalted position among the nations. A covetous desire for the possessions of the people of God, and envy at his exalted position in the centre of the world, are therefore the motives by which Gog is impelled to enter upon his predatory expedition against the people living in the depth of peace. This covetousness is so great, that even the rich trading populations of Sabaea, Dedan, and Tarshish (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>) perceive it, and declare that it is this alone which has determined Gog to undertake his expedition. The words of these peoples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-13.htm">Ezekiel 38:13</a>) are not to be taken as expressing their sympathies (Kliefoth), but serve to give prominence to the obvious thirst for booty which characterizes the multitude led by Gog. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, their young lions, are the rapacious rulers of these trading communities, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a> introduces the announcement of the punishment, which consists of another summary account of the daring enterprise of Gog and his hosts (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4-9</a>), and a clear statement of the design of God in leading him against His people and land. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, close), of which different renderings have been given, does not mean, thou wilt experience, or be aware of, the punishment; but the object is to be taken from the context: thou wilt know, or perceive, sc. that Israel dwells securely, not expecting any hostile invasion.
