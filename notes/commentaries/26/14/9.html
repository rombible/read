He “persuades” the prophet in the same sense in which He hardened Pharaoh’s heart, by making such persuasion the natural consequence of the immutable moral laws which He has ordained. Men are held back from sin only by God’s own Holy Spirit drawing them towards Himself. When they set this aside by transgressing God’s commands, the inevitable tendency—the tendency under the moral laws God has established—is to further sin. Hence the prophet who allowed himself to be persuaded, contrary to God’s command, to answer the hypocritical enquirer at all, would inevitably be persuaded further to answer him according to his desires. God does not <span class= "ital">force </span>men either to receive the truth or to act righteously. If, notwithstanding His remonstrances, their hearts are set upon wrong, He will even give them up and “send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:">2Thessalonians 2:11</a>). We are too often told in Scripture of this method of the Divine dealing to leave any room for us to misunderstand the principle. The result is a terrible one, but it is quite in keeping with all we can observe of the Divine work in nature. The man that refuses the medicine, must sink under the disease. The principle is clearly exemplified in the case of Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1Kings 22:19-23</a>), where the Lord is represented as sending a lying spirit into the mouths of the prophets, that they might counsel the king to the wrong course he was already determined to take. God is declared to do this because it was the result under His moral laws of the wicked and domineering spirit of the king who had driven away the true prophets and gathered around himself those who were willing to pervert their office and prophesy falsely to gratify his wishes. Of course this is not to suppose that God can ever be the author of sin and deceit; but He has ordained that sin shall punish itself, and when the heart rejects Him, He withdraws His Spirit from it and gives it up to its own delusions. Thus when Saul’s heart became alienated from God, and “the Spirit of the Lord departed from” him, the evil spirit, which came instead, is said to be “from the LORD” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-14.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.">1Samuel 16:14</a>). This kind of judgment is necessarily more common in times of great and general declension from the right. Hence false prophets were especially abundant towards the close of the kingdom of Judah, and form a marked characteristic in the New Testament prophecies of “the last days.” No more terrible judgment can be imagined than that of thus giving up the sinner to the consequences of his own sin.<p><span class= "bld">Will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</span>—This is not the word which is so often used in the penalties of the law, “will cut him off from my people.” The latter refers only to excommunication, to exclusion from the privileges of the chosen people; but this means that the untrue prophet shall literally be destroyed, like Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm" title="And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.">Numbers 31:8</a>), among the enemies of God with whom he had cast in his lot.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/14-9.htm" title="And if the prophet be deceived when he has spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him, and will destroy him from the middle of my people Israel....">Ezekiel 14:9-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And if the prophet be deceived — </span>Or, <span class="ital">seduced. </span>This is to be understood of the false prophets, whose practices are reproved throughout the whole foregoing chapter. <span class="ital">I the Lord have deceived that prophet — </span>I Jehovah have suffered him to be deceived; I have given him up to <span class="ital">strong delusions, </span>as a just judgment upon him for going after idols, and setting up false pretences to inspiration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:...">2 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a>.

He turns it as He will, employing it to test the sincerity of men, and thus making it ultimately contribute to the purification of His people, to the confirmation of the righteous, to the increase of their glory and felicity. The case of the false prophets who deceived Ahab <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a> is a striking representation of this principle. The Lord sends forth an evil spirit to persuade Ahab to his ruin. Toward the close of the kingdom of Judah false prophets were especially rife. The thoughts of men's hearts were revealed, the good separated from the bad, and the remnant of the people purged from the sins by which of late years the whole nation had been defiled. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. I the Lord have deceived that prophet&#8212;not directly, but through Satan and his ministers; not merely permissively, but by overruling their evil to serve the purposes of His righteous judgment, to be a touchstone to separate the precious from the vile, and to "prove" His people (De 13:3; 1Ki 22:23; Jer 4:10; 2Th 2:11, 12). Evil comes not from God, though God overrules it to serve His will (Job 12:16; Jas 1:3). This declaration of God is intended to answer their objection, "Jeremiah and Ezekiel are but two opposed to the many prophets who announce 'peace' to us." "Nay, deceive not yourselves, those prophets of yours are deluding you, and I permit them to do so as a righteous judgment on your wilful blindness."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The prophet, </span> viz. the prophet who makes this his trade and gain, the false prophet, who speaks all serene and quiet, in hope of reward for his kind answer to those that desired to hear what might please them more than what God commanded, promised, or threatened. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Have deceived; </span> permitted him to err, or. iustly left him in his blindness, that he shall not discern his own self-deceivings; or else when such prophet promiseth good, and thinks concurrence of all second causes tend to it, yet I will disappoint and frustrate, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm" title="That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;">Isaiah 44:25</a></span>, if the confederacies to save were in likelihood sufficient, and it were no presumption to hope the best; and if your prophets on this ground promised you success, yet they shall deceive you, for I would defeat and disappoint them and you; so the sense would not carry a moral and culpable deceiving, but a just defeating and disappointing, or disabling, second causes, on which disappointment of hopes will follow.

That is pleasing to men, and is not true, in hope of reward and applause, but it never comes to pass, and his expectations are not answered: <p>I the Lord have deceived that prophet; by sending a lying spirit to him, as to Ahab's prophets, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22</a>; by giving him up to strong delusions, to believe a lie, and publish it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>; and to his own heart's lusts; being willing, for the sake of gain, to prophesy smooth things, though false to the people, promising them peace when there was none; and then by frustrating his predictions, and disappointing him of his ends and views. R. Saadiah interprets this, as Kimchi observes, of God revealing and making it manifest that he was deceived; but more is meant by it than this, or even a bare permission; for though God is not the author of sin, yet he wills it to be done for wise ends and purposes, and sometimes in a way of judgment, as a punishment for sin; and which was the case here; both with respect to the prophet that deceived, who as the fruit of his sin, his covetousness, was given up in just judgment to a reprobate mind; and the people that were deceived, who, rejecting the true prophets of the Lord, were willing to have smooth things prophesied to them: <p>and I will stretch out my hand upon them; his avenging hand; the stroke of his power, as the Targum; a heavy one, and that for giving heed to a lying spirit; for uttering falsehood, and that with a wicked design, to gain the applause of the people, or for filthy lucre's sake: <p>and I will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel; by some sore judgment or sudden death, and so be made a public example of. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And if the prophet be <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</span><p>(f) The prophet declares that God for man's ingratitude raises up false prophets to seduce them that delight in lies rather than in the truth of God, and thus he punishes sin with sin, 1Ki 22:20,22 and destroys those prophets as well as the people.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9–11</span>.

The meaning appears to be: if the prophet, entering into the “heart” of the idolaters, the circle and direction of their thoughts, and the general spirit which animates them, gives them a prophetic oracle which coincides with the line of their thoughts, and thus helps to foster their delusions, that prophet himself has been seduced or enticed; and it is the Lord who has enticed him. The passage has a resemblance to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-20.htm" title="And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.">1 Kings 22:20</a>. There a lying spirit came forth from the Lord and entered into the prophets of Ahab and deceived them, so that they entered into the designs of the wicked king and gave an answer favourable to him. Here it is the Lord himself who entices the prophet. In both cases this enticement or deception was in punishment for previous sin. Ezekiel does not appear to reflect upon the point whether the prophet before being deceived was true or false. The “prophet” became false when deceived, when he entered into the spirit and purposes of the idolaters, and spoke a word to them in the line of their sinful conduct and hopes. And this word merely hardened them in their mind and was a step towards taking them in their own heart (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm" title="That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.">Ezekiel 14:5</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I the Lord have deceived that</span>  <span class="cmt_word">prophet,</span> etc. The teaching of modern thought is to soften language like this into "I have permitted him to be deceived." The distinction was seldom, if ever, present to the mind of the Old Testament, or indeed of the New Testament, writers. It is Jehovah who sends the "lying spirit" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20 -23</a>. It is he who in the latter days shall send men "strong delusions" that they shall believe a lie (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). In both cases it is implied that the delusion is a righteous punishment, is indeed the natural, because the divinely appointed, punishment of the sin. <span class="accented">Populus vult decipi et decipiatur</span>, but the very deception is a means for undeceiving them. At last their eyes shall be opened. The punishment of the false prophet and of those who trust him is at once retributive, and a discipline, and, if the discipline fails for them, at least a warning for others. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Against the False Prophetesses<p>As the Lord had not endowed men only with the gifts of prophecy, but sometimes women also, e.g., Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah; so women also rose up along with the false prophets, and prophesied out of their own hearts without being impelled by the Spirit of God. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Ezekiel 13:17-19</a>.

And ye profane me with my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay souls which should not die, and to keep alive which should not live, by your lying to my people who hearken to lying. - Like the prophets in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>, the prophetesses are here described as prophesying out of their own heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Ezekiel 13:17</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-18.htm">Ezekiel 13:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a> their offences are more particularly described. The meaning of these verses is entirely dependent upon the view to be taken of &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, which the majority of expositors, following the lead of the lxx, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, have regarded as identical with &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1497;&#1491;, and understood as referring to the hands of the women or prophetesses. But there is nothing to justify the assumption that &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; is an unusual form for &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, which even Ewald takes it to be (Lehrbuch, 177a). Still less can it stand for the singular &#1497;&#1491;. And we have not sufficient ground for altering the text, as the expression &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a> (I will tear the &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; from your arms) does not require the assumption that the prophetesses had hidden their arms in &#1499;&#1505;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;; and such a supposition is by no means obviously in harmony with the facts.<p>The word &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;, with &#1514; fem. treated as a radical letter (cf. Ewald, 186e), means a covering or concealment  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;. The meaning "cushion" or "pillow" (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, Vulg. pulvilli) is merely an inference drawn from this passage, and is decidedly erroneous; for the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; (to sew together) is inapplicable to cushions, as well as the phrase &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, inasmuch as cushions are not placed upon the joints of the hands, and still less are they sewed together upon them. The latter is also a decisive reason for rejecting the explanation given by Hvernick, namely, that the kesa&#770;tho&#772;th were carpets, which were used as couches, and upon which these voluptuous women are represented as reclining. For cushions or couches are not placed upon, but under, the arm-joints (or elbows) and the shoulders, which Hvernick understands by &#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;. This also overthrows another explanation given of the words, namely, that they refer to carpets, which the prophetesses had sewed together for all their arm-joints, so as to form comfortable beds upon splendid carpets, that they may indulge in licentiousness thereon. The explanation given by Ephraem Syrus, and adopted by Hitzig, namely, that the kesa&#770;tho&#772;th were amulets or straps, which they would round their arm-joints when they received or delivered their oracles, is equally untenable. For, as Kliefoth has observed, "it is evident that there is not a word in the text about adultery, or amulets, or straps used in prayer." And again, when we proceed to the next clause, the traditional rendering of &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, as signifying either pillows (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, Symm.; cervicalia, Vulg.) or broad cloaks  equals  &#1502;&#1496;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (Hitzig, Hvernick, etc.), is neither supported by the usage of the language, nor in harmony with &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;. Mispa&#770;cho&#772;th, from sa&#770;phach, to join, cannot have any other meaning in the present context than a cap fitting close to the head; and &#1506;&#1500; must denote the pattern which was followed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-26.htm">Esther 9:26</a> : they make the caps after (answering to) the head of every stature. The words of both clauses are figurative, and have been correctly explained by Kliefoth as follows: "A double charge is brought against the prophetesses. In the first place, they sew coverings together to wrap round all the joints of the hand of God, so that He cannot touch them; i.e., they cover up and conceal the word of God by their prophesying, more especially its rebuking and threatening force, so that the threatening and judicial arm of God, which ought above all to become both manifest and effective through His prophetic word, does not become either one or the other. In the second place, they make coverings upon the heads of men, and construct them in such a form that they exactly fit the stature or size or every individual, so that the men neither hear nor see; i.e., by means of their flattering lies, which adapt themselves to the subjective inclinations of their hearers at the time, they cover up the senses of the men, so that they retain neither ear nor eye for the truth." They do both of these to catch souls. The inevitable consequence of their act is represented as having been intended by them; and this intention is then still further defined as being to catch the souls of the people of God; i.e., to allure them to destruction, and take care of their own souls. The clause &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; is not to be taken as a question, "Will ye catch the souls?" implying a doubt whether they really thought that they could carry on such conduct as theirs with perfect impunity (Hvernick). It contains a simple statement of what really took place in their catching of souls, namely, "they catch the souls of the people of God, and preserve their own souls;" i.e., they rob the people of God of their lives, and take care of their own (Kliefoth). &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; is used instead of the genitive (stat. constr.) to show that the accent rests upon &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;. And in the same way we have &#1500;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492; instead of the suffix. The construction is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-16.htm">1 Samuel 14:16</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a> shows how great their sin had been. They profane God among His people; namely, by delivering the suggestions of their own heart to the people as divine revelations, for the purpose of getting their daily bread thereby (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>); by hurling into destruction, through their lies, those who are only too glad to listen to lying; by slaying the souls of the people which ought to live, and by preserving those which ought not to live, i.e., their own souls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>). The punishment for this will not fail to come. </body></html>
