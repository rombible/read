Though sinners escape one judgment, another is waiting for them. When God's professing people rebel against him, they may justly expect all his judgments. The faith, obedience, and prayers of Noah prevailed to the saving of his house, but not of the old world. Job's sacrifice and prayer in behalf of his friends were accepted, and Daniel had prevailed for the saving his companions and the wise men of Babylon. But a people that had filled the measure of their sins, was not to expect to escape for the sake of any righteous men living among them; not even of the most eminent saints, who could be accepted in their own case only through the sufferings and righteousness of Christ. Yet even when God makes the greatest desolations by his judgments, he saves some to be monuments of his mercy. In firm belief that we shall approve the whole of God's dealings with ourselves, and with all mankind, let us silence all rebellious murmurs and objections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Noah, Daniel, and Job - Three striking instances of men who, for their integrity, were delivered from the ruin which fell upon others. Some have thought it strange that Daniel, a contemporary, and still young, should have been classed with the two ancient worthies. But the account of him <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> shows, that by this time Daniel was a very remarkable man (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a>), and the introduction of the name of a contemporary gives force and life to the illustration. There is in the order in which the names occur a kind of climax. Noah did not rescue the guilty world, but did carry forth with him his wife, sons, and sons' wives. Daniel raised only a few, but he did raise three of his countrymen with him to honor. To Job was spared neither son nor daughter.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-21. The argument is cumulative. He first puts the case of the land sinning so as to fall under the judgment of a famine (Eze 14:13); then (Eze 14:15) "noisome beasts" (Le 26:22); then "the sword"; then, worst of all, "pestilence." The three most righteous of men should deliver only themselves in these several four cases. In Eze 14:21 he concentrates the whole in one mass of condemnation. If Noah, Daniel, Job, could not deliver the land, when deserving only one judgment, "how much more" when all four judgments combined are justly to visit the land for sin, shall these three righteous men not deliver it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As I live; </span> a form of speech in which God by oath confirms what he speaketh, and it is such an oath as becomes him only, who is life, and cannot die. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither sons nor daughters; </span> neither sons that should perpetuate their families, and are the support of houses, nor daughters, the tenderness of whose sex and age does make and keep parents’ affections fervent towards them.

Above named, Noah, Daniel, and Job; as they were not, two of them not being in the land of the living, and the other in Babylon; but if all three had been in a land so threatened, and used all the interest they had with God, by fervent prayer and supplication, to have called in the wild beasts, and chained them up, and to preserve the people from being destroyed by them, it would have been all in vain; the Lord was determined upon the destruction of them, and by means of these, as one of his sore judgments: <p>as I live, saith the Lord God; or by my life; for it is an oath with which God swears by himself, who has life in himself, and is the author and giver of life to others, and can take it away when, and in what manner, he pleases; and this oath is used, to show the unalterableness of the judgment threatened, it being decreed and sworn to: God's word or decree, and his oath, are two immutable things, in which he cannot lie, and from which he never departs: <p>they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; meaning not adult persons, but little ones, infant sons and daughters; such as had not been guilty of the actual sins and transgressions their parents were charged with; even these they should not deliver by their prayers and supplications from being destroyed by noisome beasts, God punishing the iniquities of the fathers upon the children; and much less should they deliver those that were adult, and had committed the same idolatries and other sins their parents had; no, not even their own sons and daughters; for no exception is made but of themselves, as follows: <p>they only shall be delivered: as Noah with his family was in the ark, when amidst wild beasts; and Daniel in the lions den; and Job, with whom the beasts of the field were at peace, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-23.htm">Job 5:23</a>; <p>but the land shall be desolate; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">neither sons nor daughters</span>] There is no support in the words for the idea of Hävernick that the three names, Noah, Daniel and Job form a climax, inasmuch as Noah saved his children, Daniel only his three fellow-exiles, while Job could deliver neither son nor daughter, though every week he interceded and made atonement for them. This idea is false to the sense of the Book of Job, for Job’s children are nowhere represented by the author of the book as having been cut off for their sins, though naturally Job’s “friends” put this construction upon their death (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm" title="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.">Ezekiel 8:4</a>). The prophet does not appear to have in view any historical details in the lives of these three men; he refers to the men themselves as great saints famous in the traditions of his people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/14-17.htm" title="Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:..."><span class="ital">Ezekiel 14:17-18</a></span>.

Son of man, these men have let their idols rise up in their heart, and have set the stumbling-block to guilt before their face: shall I allow myself to be inquired of by them? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>. Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Every man of the house of Israel who lifteth up his idols in his heart, and setteth the stumbling-block to his sin before his face, and cometh to the prophet, to him do I, Jehovah, show myself, answering according thereto, according to the multitude of his idols; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm">Ezekiel 14:5</a>. To grasp the house of Israel by their heart, because they have turned away from me, all of them through their idols. - We have not to picture these elders to ourselves as given up to gross idolatry. &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1489; means, to allow anything to come into the mind, to permit it to rise up in the heart, to be mentally busy therewith. "To set before one's face" is also to be understood, in a spiritual sense, as relating to a thing which a man will not put out of his mind. &#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500; , stumbling-block to sin and guilt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>), i.e., the idols. Thus the two phrases simply denote the leaning of the heart and spirit towards false gods. God does not suffer those whose heart is attached to idols to seek and find Him. The interrogative clause '&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; contains a strong negation. The emphasis lies in the infinitive absolute &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; et placed before the verb, in which the &#1492; is softened into &#1488;, to avoid writing &#1492; twice. &#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to allow oneself to be sought, involves the finding of God; hence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a> we have &#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; as parallel to &#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm">Ezekiel 14:5</a>, there follows a positive declaration of the attitude of God towards those who are devoted to idolatry in their heart. Every such Israelite will be answered by God according to the measure of the multitude of his idols. The Niphal &#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;  has not the signification of the Kal, and does not mean "to be answerable," as Ewald supposes, or to converse; but is generally used in a passive sense, "to be answered," i.e., to find or obtain a hearing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-2.htm">Job 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>). It is employed here in a reflective sense, to hold or show oneself answering. &#1489;&#1492;, according to the Chetib &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, for which the Keri suggests the softer gloss &#1489;&#1488;, refers to '&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; &#1490;&#1500; which follows; the nominative being anticipated, according to an idiom very common in Aramaean, by a previous pronoun. It is written here for the sake of emphasis, to bring the following object into more striking prominence. &#1489; is used here in the sense of secundum, according to, not because, since this meaning is quite unsuitable for the &#1489; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-7.htm">Ezekiel 14:7</a>, where it occurs in the same connection (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;). The manner in which God will show Himself answering the idolatry according to their idols, is reserved till <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a>. Here, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm">Ezekiel 14:5</a>, the design of this procedure on the part of God is given: viz., to grasp Israel by the heart; i.e., not merely to touch and to improve them, but to bring down their heart by judgments (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>), and thus move them to give up idolatry and return to the living God. &#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, to recede, to draw away from God. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is an emphatic repetition of the subject belonging to &#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;.</body></html>
