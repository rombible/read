Noah, as a reward of his piety, saved eight persons out of the universal deluge, and obtained a promise from God that he would never destroy the world so again, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm" title="And the LORD smelled a sweet smell; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.">Genesis 8:21</a>. Daniel interceded with God for the whole nation of the Jews, and obtained a promise of their restoration, and of the coming of the Messiah, Daniel 9. Job was appointed by God to make intercession for his three friends, and obtained pardon for them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm" title="Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.">Job 42:8</a>. But when God’s irreversible decree is gone out against a nation which hath filled up the measure of its iniquity, even the prayers of such men will be ineffectual toward their deliverance. For it is only for those that are not arrived to that height of wickedness, that the prayers of the righteous avail: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.">Jeremiah 15:1</a>. We may observe here how early the fame of Daniel’s piety was spread over Chaldea, who at this time was probably not above thirty years of age; he having been carried to Babylon only fourteen years before, when he was very young. For he was taken captive in the third year of Jehoiakim, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.">Daniel 1:1</a>,) who, after this, reigned eight years, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-36.htm" title="Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.">2 Kings 23:36</a>. And this prophecy, as appears from chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>, was uttered in the sixth year of Jehoiachin’s captivity, who succeeded Jehoiakim, and only reigned three months.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:12-23 National sins bring national judgments. Though sinners escape one judgment, another is waiting for them. When God's professing people rebel against him, they may justly expect all his judgments. The faith, obedience, and prayers of Noah prevailed to the saving of his house, but not of the old world. Job's sacrifice and prayer in behalf of his friends were accepted, and Daniel had prevailed for the saving his companions and the wise men of Babylon. But a people that had filled the measure of their sins, was not to expect to escape for the sake of any righteous men living among them; not even of the most eminent saints, who could be accepted in their own case only through the sufferings and righteousness of Christ. Yet even when God makes the greatest desolations by his judgments, he saves some to be monuments of his mercy. In firm belief that we shall approve the whole of God's dealings with ourselves, and with all mankind, let us silence all rebellious murmurs and objections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14.htm">Jeremiah 14</a>; 15 is a remarkable parallel to this prophecy.

Therefore ye shall no more see vanity, and no longer practise soothsaying: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall learn that I am Jehovah. - The threat of judgment is closely connected with the reproof of their sins. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-21.htm">Ezekiel 13:21</a> correspond to the reproof in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-18.htm">Ezekiel 13:18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-23.htm">Ezekiel 13:23</a> to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>. In the first place, the Lord will tear in pieces the coverings and caps, i.e., the tissue of lies woven by the false prophetesses, and rescue the people from their snares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-21.htm">Ezekiel 13:21</a>); and, secondly, He will entirely put an end to the pernicious conduct of the persons addressed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-23.htm">Ezekiel 13:23</a>). The words from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; to &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a>), when taken as one clause, as they generally are, offer insuperable difficulties, since it is impossible to get any satisfactory meaning from &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, and &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; will not fit in. Whether we understand by kesa&#770;tho&#772;th coverings or cushions, the connection of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (where ye catch the souls), which the majority of commentators prefer, is untenable; for coverings and cushions were not the places where the souls were caught, but could only be the means employed for catching them. Instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; we should expect &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;; and Hitzig proposes to amend it in this way. Still less admissible is the proposal to take &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; as referring to Jerusalem ("wherewith ye catch souls there"); as &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; would not only contain a perfectly superfluous definition of locality, but would introduce a limitation altogether at variance with the context. It is not affirmed either of the prophets or of the prophetesses that they lived and prophesied in Jerusalem alone. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Ezekiel 13:17</a> reference is made in the most general terms to the prophets of Israel and the daughters of thy people; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-16.htm">Ezekiel 13:16</a> it is simply stated that the false prophets prophesied peace to Jerusalem when there was no peace at all. Consequently we must regard the attempt to find in &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; an allusion to Jerusalem (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-16.htm">Ezekiel 13:16</a>) as a mere loophole, which betrays an utter inability to get any satisfactory sense for the word. Moreover, if we construe the words in this manner, &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; is also incomprehensible. Commentators have for the most part admitted that &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495; taht  is used here in the Aramaean sense of volare, to fly. In the second half of the verse there is no doubt about its having this meaning. For &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-7.htm">Deuteronomy 22:7</a> for liberating a bird, or letting it fly; and the combination &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;  is supported by the expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; &#1500;&#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-26.htm">Exodus 21:26</a>, while the comparison of souls to birds is sustained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>. Hence the true meaning of the whole passage &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;... &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; is, I send away (set free) the souls, which ye have caught, as flying ones, i.e., so that they shall be able to fly away at liberty. And in the first half also we must not adopt a different rendering for &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, since &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; is also connected with it there.<p>But if the words in question are combined into one clause in the first hemistich, they will give us a sense which is obviously wrong, viz., "wherewith ye catch the souls to let them fly." As the impossibility of adopting this rendering has been clearly seen, the attempt has been made to cloak over the difficulty by means of paraphrases. Ewald, for example, renders &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; in both cases "as if they were birds of passage;" but in the first instance he applies it to birds of passage, for which nets are spread for the purpose of catching them; and in the second, to birds of passage which are set at liberty. Thus, strictly speaking, he understands the first &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; as signifying the catching of birds; and the second, letting them fly: an explanation which refutes itself, as pa&#770;rach, to fly, cannot mean "to catch" as well. The rendering adopted by Kimchi, Rosenmller, and others, who translate &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; ut advolent ad vos in the first hemistich, and ut avolent in the second, is no better. And the difficulty is not removed by resorting to the dialects, as Hvernick, for the purpose of forcing upon &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; the meaning dissoluteness of licentiousness, for which there is no authority in the Hebrew language itself. If, therefore, it is impossible to obtain any satisfactory meaning from the existing text, it cannot be correct; and no other course is open to us than to alter the unsuitable &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, and divide the words from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; to &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; into two clauses, as we have done in our translation above. There is no necessity to supply anything to the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; is construed with a double accusative (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>, &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;, to catch with a net), and the object to &#1502;&#1510;&#1491;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, viz., the souls, can easily be supplied from the next clause. &#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, as a participle, can either be connected with &#1492;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, "behold, I make," or taken as introducing an explanatory clause: "making the souls into flying ones," i.e., so that they are able to fly (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, etc.). The two clauses of the first hemistich would then exactly correspond to the two clauses of the second half of the verse. &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; is explanatory of &#1492;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; &#1499;&#1505;&#1514;, I will tear off the coverings from their arms. These words do not require the assumption that the prophetesses wore the &#1500;&#1505;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; on their arms, but may be fully explained from the supposition that the persons in question prepared them with their own hands. '&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; corresponds to '&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;; and &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; is governed by &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The insertion of &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is to be accounted for from the copious nature of Ezekiel's style; at the same time, it is not merely a repetition of &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, which is separated from &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; by the relative clause '&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1502;&#1495;, but as the unusual plural form &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; shows, is intended as a practical explanation of the fact, that the souls, while compared to birds, are regarded as living beings, which is the meaning borne by &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; in other passages. The omission of the article after &#1488;&#1514; may be explained, however, from the fact that the souls had been more precisely defined just before; just as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>, where the more precise definition follows immediately afterwards (cf. Ewald, 277a, p. 683). - The same thing is said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-21.htm">Ezekiel 13:21</a>, with regard to the caps, as has already been said of the coverings in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a>. God will tear these in pieces also, to deliver His people from the power of the lying prophetesses. In what way God will do this is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-23.htm">Ezekiel 13:23</a>, namely, not only by putting their lying prophecies to shame through His judgment, but by putting an end to soothsaying altogether, and exterminating the false prophetesses by making them an object of ridicule and shame. The reason for this threat is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a>, where a further description is given of the disgraceful conduct of these persons; and here the disgracefulness of their conduct is exhibited in literal terms and without any figure. They do harm to the righteous and good, and strengthen the hands of the wicked. &#1492;&#1499;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, Hiphil of &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, in Syriac, to use harshly or depress; so here in the Hiphil, connected with &#1500;&#1489;, to afflict the heart. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; is used adverbially: with lying, or in a lying manner; namely, by predicting misfortune and divine punishments, with which they threatened the godly, who would not acquiesce in their conduct; whereas, on the contrary, they predicted prosperity and peace to the ungodly, who were willing to be ensnared by them, and thus strengthened them in their evil ways. For this God would put them to shame through His judgments, which would make their deceptions manifest, and their soothsaying loathsome. </body></html>
