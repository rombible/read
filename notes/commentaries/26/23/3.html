Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, my tabernacle is in her, because their temple was the place which God himself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures are according to those times. Will not such humbling representations of nature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hiding pride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it not also prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by his Holy Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holy conversation and godliness?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of one mother - Israel and Judah were branches of the same stock. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The two kingdoms are represented ideally as already existing in Egypt. This is not so far from the truth. The great tribes of Judah and Ephraim from the first stood apart, and in their attitude there lay already the germs of the two kingdoms, as appears in the song of Deborah. On the idea of the prophet that idolatry was practised in Egypt, cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-8.htm" title="But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 20:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-26.htm" title="You have also committed fornication with the Egyptians your neighbors, great of flesh; and have increased your prostitutions, to provoke me to anger.">Ezekiel 16:26</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Refining of Israel in the Furnace of Besieged Jerusalem<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-17.htm">Ezekiel 22:17</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Ezekiel 22:18</a>. Son of man, the house of Israel has become to me as dross; they are all brass, and tin, and iron, and lead in the furnace; dross of silver have they become. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-19.htm">Ezekiel 22:19</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because ye have all become dross, therefore, behold, I gather you together in Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>. As men gather together silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin into the furnace, to blow the fire upon it for melting, so will I gather (you) together in my anger and my wrath, and put you in and melt you. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-21.htm">Ezekiel 22:21</a>. And I will collect you together, and blow the fire of my wrath upon you, that ye may be melted therein. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-22.htm">Ezekiel 22:22</a>. As silver is melted in the furnace, so shall ye be melted therein (viz., in Jerusalem), and shall learn that I Jehovah have poured out my wrath upon you. - This second word of God rests no doubt upon the figure in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>, of the uncleanness or dirt of sin; but it is not an exposition of the removal of the dirt, as predicted there. For that was to be effected through the dispersion of Israel among the nations, whereas the word of God, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-17.htm">Ezekiel 22:17</a> onwards, represents the siege awaiting Jerusalem as a melting process, through which God will separate the silver ore contained in Israel from the baser metals mingled with it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Ezekiel 22:18</a> it commences with a description of the existing condition of Israel. It has turned to dross. &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; is clearly a perfect, and is not to be taken as a prophetical future, as Kliefoth proposes. Such a rendering is not only precluded by the clause '&#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;  in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-19.htm">Ezekiel 22:19</a>, cut could only be made to yield an admissible sense by taking the middle clause of the verse, "all of them brass and tin," etc., as a statement of what Israel had become, or as a preterite in opposition to all the rules of Hebrew syntax, inasmuch as this clause merely furnishes an explanation of &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1500;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;, which only occurs here, for &#1505;&#1497;&#1490; signifies dross, not smelting-ore (Kliefoth), literally, recedanea, the baser ingredients which are mixed with the silver, and separated from it by smelting. This is the meaning here, where it is directly afterwards interpreted as consisting of brass, tin, iron, and lead, and then still further defined as &#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;, dross of silver, i.e., brass, tin, iron, and lead, with a mixture of silver. Because Israel had turned into silver-dross of this kind, the Lord would gather it together in Jerusalem, to smelt it there as in a smelting furnace; just as men gather together brass, iron, lead, and tin in a furnace to smelt them, or rather to separate the silver contained thereon. &#1511;&#1489;&#1510;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;, literally, a collection of silver, etc., for "like a collection." The &#1499; simil. is probably omitted for the sake of euphony, to avoid the discord occasioned by prefixing it to &#1511;&#1489;&#1510;&#1514;. Ezekiel mentions the silver as well, because there is some silver contained in the brass, iron, etc., or the dross is silver-dross. &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, nomen verbale, from &#1504;&#1514;&#1498; in the Hiphil, smelting; literally, as the smelting of silver takes place in the furnace. The smelting is treated here simply as a figurative representation of punishment, and consequently the result of the smelting, namely, the refining of the silver by the removal of the baser ingredients, is not referred to any further, as in the case in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27-30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>. This smelting process was experienced by Israel in the last siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. </body></html>
