As a jealous husband, enraged against his adulterous wife, falls upon her in his fury, and uses her with great severity; so the Jews having committed spiritual fornication, that is, idolatry, and departed from the Lord, he threatens to stir up the fury of his jealousy, and punish them severely by the Chaldeans, as follows: <p>they shall take away thy nose and thine ears, and thy remnant shall fall by the sword; as gallants use their harlots when they leave them, or jealous husbands their adulterous wives, disfiguring them, that they may be marked and known what they are, and be despised by others; and as has been the custom in some countries, particularly with the Egyptians, to cut off the noses of adulterous persons; here it is to be understood figuratively: by the "nose", according to Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, is meant the king, who is higher than his people, as the nose is the highest part in a man's face; and by the "ears" the priest, who caused a noise to be heard when he entered into the temple with his bells; or rather because it was the priest's office to attend to the word of God, and teach it the people; in general, these denote everything that was excellent among the Jews, their city, temple, king, kingdom, princes, priests, and prophets, which should be demolished and removed; and by the remnant is meant the common people, that should come into the hands of the Chaldeans, and fall by their sword. So the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"thy princes and thy nobles shall go into captivity, and thy people shall be killed with the sword:'' <p>they shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire; take and carry their sons and daughters captive, and burn with fire the city left by them. Thus the Targum, <p>"they shall carry thy sons and daughters captive, and the beauty of thy land shall be burnt with fire;'' <p>that is, the city of Jerusalem, the temple, the king's palaces, the houses of the great men, and others in it, which were all burnt with fire when taken by the Chaldeans, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-13.htm">Jeremiah 52:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> nose and thy ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy remnant shall be devoured by the fire.</span><p>(i) They will destroy your princes and priests with the rest of your people.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. “Jealousy” differs little from fury, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-38.htm" title="And I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give you blood in fury and jealousy.">Ezekiel 16:38</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">take away thy nose</span>] Reference is either to the ancient practice (as in Egypt) of mutilating the adulteress, or to the habit of disfiguring the captives, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm" title="My net also will I spread on him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.">Ezekiel 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-40.htm" title="They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.">Ezekiel 16:40</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall take away thy nose and thine ears</span>, etc. (For instances of this or like mutilation, in the case of prisoners of war, see the case of Zedekiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>; Herod., 3:69, 154.) Possibly it may have been known to Ezekiel as a punishment for the adulterer or adulteress in Egypt and other countries, and if so, he might have selected it as specially appropriate to his parable (Martial, 'Epigr.,' 2:83; 3:85). <span class="cmt_word">Thy residue shall be consumed with fire</span>. The Hebrew word for "residue" (not that usually so translated) is the same as that previously translated "remnant." In the first clause it clearly points to the men of Jerusalem who are left after the capture. In the second its meaning is determined by the fact that it follows after the deportation of the sons and daughters. All that was left - in the parable, of the mutilated trunk of the adulteress, in the history, of the devastated city, <span class="accented">sc</span>. the empty houses - should be destroyed by fire. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Whoredom of Judah<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-11.htm">Ezekiel 23:11</a>. And her sister Oholibah saw it, and carried on her coquetry still more wantonly than she had done, and her whoredom more than the whoredom of her sister. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a>. She was inflamed with lust towards the sons of Asshur, governors and officers, standing near, clothed in perfect beauty, horsemen riding upon horses, choice men of good deportment. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-13.htm">Ezekiel 23:13</a>. And I saw that she had defiled herself; they both went one way. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a>. And she carried her whoredom still further; she saw men engraved upon the wall, figures of Chaldeans engraved with red ochre, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-15.htm">Ezekiel 23:15</a>. Girded about the hips with girdles, with overhanging caps upon their heads, all of them knights in appearance, resembling the sons of Babel, the land of whose birth is Chaldea: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-16.htm">Ezekiel 23:16</a>. And she was inflamed with lust toward them, when her eyes saw them, and sent messengers to them to Chaldea. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-17.htm">Ezekiel 23:17</a>. Then the sons of Babylon came to her to the bed of love, and defiled her with their whoredom; and when she had defiled herself with them, her soul tore itself away from them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>. And when she uncovered her whoredom, and uncovered her nakedness, my soul tore itself away from her, as my soul had torn itself away from her sister. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-19.htm">Ezekiel 23:19</a>. And she increased her whoredom, so that she remembered the days of her youth, when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-20.htm">Ezekiel 23:20</a>. And she burned toward their paramours, who have members like asses and heat like horses. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-21.htm">Ezekiel 23:21</a>. Thou lookest after the lewdness of thy youth, when they of Egypt handled thy bosom because of thy virgin breasts. - The train of thought in these verses is the following: - Judah went much further than Samaria. It not only indulged in sinful intercourse with Assyria, which led on to idolatry as the latter had done, but it also allowed itself to be led astray by the splendour of Chaldea, to form alliances with that imperial power, and to defile itself with her idolatry. And when it became tired of the Chaldeans, it formed impure connections with the Egyptians, as it had done once before during its sojourn in Egypt. The description of the Assyrians in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a> coincides with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-5.htm">Ezekiel 23:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>, except that some of the predicates are placed in a different order, and &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is substituted for &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1514;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;. The former expression, which occurs again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>, must really mean the same as &#1514;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514; '&#1500;&#1489;. But it does not follow from this that &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500; signifies purple, as Hitzig maintains. The true meaning is perfection; and when used of the clothing, it signifies perfect beauty. The Septuagint rendering, &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;, with a beautiful border - more especially a variegated one - merely expresses the sense, but not the actual meaning of &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500;. The Chaldee rendering is &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1490;&#1502;&#1512;, perfecte induti. - There is great obscurity in the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a> as to the way in which Judah was seduced to cultivate intercourse with the Chaldeans. She saw men engraved or drawn upon the wall (&#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;, a participle Pual of &#1495;&#1511;&#1511;, engraved work, or sculpture). These figures were pictures of Chaldeans, engraved (drawn) with &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, red ochre, a bright-red colour. &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, an adjective form &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;, wearing a girdle. &#1496;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, coloured cloth, from &#1496;&#1489;&#1500;, to colour; here, according to the context, variegated head-bands or turbans. &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, the overhanging, used here of the cap. The reference is to the tiarae tinctae (Vulgate), the lofty turbans or caps, as they are to be seen upon the monuments of ancient Nineveh. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, not chariot-warriors, but knights: "tristatae, the name of the second grade after the regal dignity" (Jerome. See the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>).<p>The description of these engravings answers perfectly to the sculptures upon the inner walls of the Assyrian palaces in the monuments of Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Kouyunjik (see Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, and Vaux, Nineveh and Persepolis). The pictures of the Chaldeans are not mythological figures (Hvernick), but sculptures depicting war-scenes, triumphal processions of Chaldean rulers and warriors, with which the Assyrian palaces were adorned. We have not to look for these sculptures in Jerusalem or Palestine. This cannot be inferred from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a>, as Hvernick supposes; nor established by Hitzig's argument, that the woman must have been in circumstances to see such pictures. The intercourse between Palestine and Nineveh, which was carried on even in Jonah's time, was quite sufficient to render it possible for the pictures to be seen. When Israelites travelled to Nineveh, and saw the palaces there, they could easily make the people acquainted with the glory of Nineveh by the accounts they would give on their return. It is no reply to this, to state that the woman does not send ambassadors till afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-16.htm">Ezekiel 23:16</a>), as Hitzig argues; for Judah sent ambassadors to Chaldea not to view the glories of Assyria, but to form alliances with the Chaldeans, or to sue for their favour. Such an embassy, for example, was sent to Babylon by Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>); and there is no doubt that in v. 16b Ezekiel has this in his mind. Others may have preceded this, concerning which the books of Kings and Chronicles are just as silent as they are concerning that of Zedekiah. The thought in these verses is therefore the following: - The acquaintance made by Israel (Judah) with the imperial splendour of the Chaldeans, as exhibited in the sculptures of their palaces, incited Judah to cultivate political and mercantile intercourse with this imperial power, which led to its becoming entangled in the heathen ways and idolatry of the Chaldeans. The Chaldeans themselves came and laid the foundation for an intercourse which led to the pollution of Judah with heathenism, and afterwards filled it with disgust, because it was brought thereby into dependence upon the Chaldeans. The consequence of all this was, that the Lord became tired of Judah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-17.htm">Ezekiel 23:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>). For instead of returning to the Lord, Judah turned to the other power of the world, namely, to Egypt; and in the time of Zedekiah renewed its ancient coquetry with that nation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-19.htm">Ezekiel 23:19-21</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>). The form &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-20.htm">Ezekiel 23:20</a>, which the Keri also gives in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>, has taken ah as a feminine termination (not the cohortative ah), like &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-1.htm">Proverbs 8:1</a> (vid., Delitzsch, Comm. on Job, en loc.). &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are scorta mascula (here (Kimchi) - a drastically sarcastic epithet applied to the sa&#770;risim, the eunuchs, or courtiers. The figurative epithet answers to the licentious character of the Egyptian idolatry. The sexual heat both of horses and asses is referred to by Aristotle, Hist. anim. vi. 22, and Columella, de re rust. vi. 27; and that of the horse has already been applied to the idolatry of the people by Jeremiah (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-26.htm">Ezekiel 16:26</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-21.htm">Ezekiel 23:21</a>), to look about for anything, i.e., to search for it; not to miss it, as Hvernick imagines. </body></html>
