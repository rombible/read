Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, my tabernacle is in her, because their temple was the place which God himself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures are according to those times. Will not such humbling representations of nature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hiding pride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it not also prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by his Holy Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holy conversation and godliness?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After Josiah's death and the usurpation of dominion by the Egyptians, the Babylonians were no doubt welcomed as friends <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>.

The Jews did not cease from their idolatries when they broke with the Babylonians; but were rather more frequent and impudent in them, and courted the friendship and alliance of other Heathen nations, and their worship; even as a lewd woman, when she has cast off her former lovers, does not leave her lewdness, but seeks after others; and by her impudence in discovering her whoredoms, and her nakedness, and by all the signs of a prostitute, draws in others to commit lewdness with her: <p>then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister; as a virtuous husband is alienated from an adulterous wife, and cannot admit her to his bed and board, so the mind of the Lord was alienated from the Jews, because of their idolatries; nor could he favour them with his presence, and the blessings of his providence and goodness, as he had formerly done; even as his mind had been alienated, on the same account, from the ten tribes of Israel, and which he showed by suffering them to be carried captive. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. “Discovered” is uncovered, revealed.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Samaria's Whoredom and Punishment<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-5.htm">Ezekiel 23:5</a>. And Oholibah played the harlot under me, and burned towards her lovers, even as far as Assyria, standing near; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>. Clothed in purple, governors and officers, all of them choice men of good deportment, horsemen riding upon horses. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-7.htm">Ezekiel 23:7</a>. And she directed her whoredom toward them, to the choice of the sons of Assyria all of them, and with all towards whom she burned, with all their idols she defiled herself. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>. Also her whoredom from Egypt she did not give up; for they had lain with her in her youth, and they had handled her virgin bosom, and had poured out their lust upon her. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-9.htm">Ezekiel 23:9</a>. Therefore I have given her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the sons of Assyria, towards whom she was inflamed. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-10.htm">Ezekiel 23:10</a>. They uncovered her nakedness, took away her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword, so that she became a legend among the women, and executed judgments upon her. - Coquetting and whoring with Assyria and Egypt denote religious and political leaning towards and connection with these nations and kingdoms, including idolatry and the formation of alliances with them, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is to be interpreted in accordance with &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-32.htm">Ezekiel 16:32</a>). &#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;, which only occurs in Ezekiel and once in Jeremiah, denotes the eager desire kindled by passionate love towards any one. By the words &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; the lovers are more precisely defined. &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; without an article is not an adjective, belonging to &#1502;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;, but in apposition, which is continued in the next verse. In these appositions the particular features, which excited the ardent passion towards the lovers, are pointed out. &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; is not to be taken in an outward or local sense, but as signifying inward or spiritual nearness: standing near, equivalent to inwardly related, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-12.htm">Psalm 38:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a>. The description given of the Assyrians in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a> contains the thought that Israel, dazzled by Assyria's splendour, and overpowered by the might of that kingdom, had been drawn into intercourse with the Assyrians, which led her astray into idolatry. The predicate, clothed in purple, points to the splendour and glory of this imperial power; the other predicates, to the magnitude of its military force. &#1508;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are rulers of higher and lower grades (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-57.htm">Jeremiah 51:57</a>). "Here the expression is a general one, signifying the different classes of office-bearers in the kingdom" (Hvernick). With regard to &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, see my comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>; and for &#1505;&#1490;&#1503;, see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>. "Riding upon horses" is added to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; to denote the noblest horsemen, in contrast to riders upon asses and camels (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-7.htm">Ezekiel 23:7</a> &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;hem is in apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1470;&#1506;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492;, and defines more precisely the instigation to pollution: with all towards whom she burned in love, namely, with all their (the lovers') idols. The thought is as follows: it was not merely through her intercourse with the Assyrians that Israel defiled herself, but also through their idols. At the same time, Samaria did not give up the idolatry which it had derived from Egypt. It was from Egypt that the worship of God under the image of the golden calves had been imported. The words are much too strong for us to understand them as relating simply to political intercourse, as Hitzig has done. We have already observed at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>, that even in Egypt itself the Israelites had defiled themselves with Egyptian idolatry, as is also stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-9.htm">Ezekiel 23:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-10.htm">Ezekiel 23:10</a>. As a punishment for this, God gave Samaria into the power of the Assyrians, so that they executed judgment upon the harlot. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-10.htm">Ezekiel 23:10</a> the prophecy passes from the figure to the fact. The uncovering of the nakedness consisted in the transportation of the sons and daughters, i.e., the population of Samaria, into exile by the Assyrians, who slew the woman herself with the sword; in other words, destroyed the kingdom of Samaria. Thus did Samaria become a name for women; that is to say, her name was circulated among the nations, her fate became an object of conversation and ridicule to the nations, not "a nickname for the nations," as Hvernick supposes (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, a later form for &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-41.htm">Ezekiel 16:41</a>). </body></html>
