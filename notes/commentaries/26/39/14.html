It implies that this occupation is to be one of long continuance, and the fact that they are to search the land through for the remains shows that the army of Gog is not conceived of as perishing when collected in one place, but when distributed all over the land. This search is only to begin after the close of the burying for seven months already described.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/39.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>39:11-22 How numerous the enemies which God destroyed for the defence of his people Israel! Times of great deliverances should be times of reformation. Every one should help the utmost he can, toward cleansing the land from reproach. Sin is an enemy every man should strive against. Those engaged in public work, especially of cleansing and reforming a land, ought to be men who will go through with what they undertake, who will be always employed. When good work is to be done, every one should further it. Having received special favours from God, let us cleanse ourselves from all evil. It is a work which will require persevering diligence, that search may be made into the secret recesses of sin. The judgments of the Lord, brought upon sin and sinners, are a sacrifice to the justice of God, and a feast to the faith and hope of God's people. See how evil pursues sinners, even after death. After all that ambitious and covetous men do and look for, a place of graves is all the Lord gives them on earth, while their guilty souls are doomed to misery in another world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Men of continual employment - literally, as margin, i. e., men regularly appointed to this business.

Here, again, the old play upon the word "passengers" recurs, and with it two or three difficulties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is not clear whether the commissioners consisted of two classes of officers, "passers through," or "searchers," who scoured the land in search of unburied skeletons or bones, which, however, they did not bury; and "buriers" proper, who, accompanying these searchers, conducted the interment of such skeletons or bones as were found (Hengstenberg, Keil); or whether the commissioners were only one body, who both searched and buried (Ewald and Smend). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is doubtful whether the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> should be taken as the sign of the accusative, and the clause translated as in the Revised Version, in which case the "passengers" that should be buried could only be the "invaders" as above (see ver. 11); or as a preposition, in which case the rendering of the Authorized Version must stand, and the "passengers" be regarded as the "searchers." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is open to debate whether ver. 14 should not close with the initial words of ver. 15, as Ewald proposes, "And the passengers shall search and pass through in the land;" or at least whether the first clause in ver. 15 should not form an independent sentence, thus: "And they that pass through in the land shall pass through," as in the Revised Version, in which case the sighting of unburied bones (ver. 15) would not necessarily be the work of "searchers," but of any one, the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> being impersonal. It is impossible to decide dogmatically in a question of so much difficulty; but the Revised Version appears to present the most exact rendering of the Hebrew, and upon the whole the most intelligible account of what was intended to take place, viz. the appointment of a special body of commissioners, who should be designated both "passengers," in ironical allusion to Gog who had meant to pass through the land, and "buffers," from the nature of the task delegated to them, viz. the interment of the "passengers," i.e. the Gogites, and who should begin their work after the main body of the slain had been removed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the end of the seven months of burying. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord will richly bless, multiply, and glorify His people, when thus renewed and sanctified. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm">Ezekiel 36:29</a>. And I will save you from all your uncleannesses, and will call the corn, and multiply it, and no more bring famine upon you; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-30.htm">Ezekiel 36:30</a>.

Not for your sake do I this, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, be this known to you; be ye ashamed and blush for your ways, O house of Israel! <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-33.htm">Ezekiel 36:33</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, In the day when I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will make the cities inhabited, and the ruins shall be built, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-34.htm">Ezekiel 36:34</a>. And the devastated land shall be tilled instead of being a desert before the eyes of every one who passed by. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-35.htm">Ezekiel 36:35</a>. And men will say, This land, which was laid waste, has become like the garden of Eden, and the desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-36.htm">Ezekiel 36:36</a>. And the nations, which have been left round about you, shall know that I Jehovah build up that which is destroyed, and plant that which is laid waste. I, Jehovah, have said it, and do it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-37.htm">Ezekiel 36:37</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will still let myself be sought by the house of Israel in this, to do it for them; I will multiply them, like a flock, in men; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-38.htm">Ezekiel 36:38</a>. Like a flock of holy sacrifices, like the flock of Jerusalem on its feast-days, so shall the desolate cities be full of flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. - The words '&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; , I help or save you from all your uncleannesses, cannot be understood as relating to their purification from the former uncleannesses; for they have already been cleansed from these, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>. The &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; can only be such defilements as are still possible even after the renewing of the people; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to help, means to guard them against any further recurrence of such defilements (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23</a>), and not to deliver them from the consequences of their former pollutions. But if God preserves His people from these, there is no longer any occasion for a fresh suspension of judgments over them, and God can bestow His blessing upon the sanctified nation without reserve. It is in this way that the further promises are appended; and, first of all, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm">Ezekiel 36:29</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-30.htm">Ezekiel 36:30</a>, a promise that He will bless them with an abundant crop of fruits, both of the orchard and the field. "I call to the corn," i.e., I cause it to come or grow, so that famine will occur no more (for the fact, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-29.htm">Ezekiel 34:29</a>).<p>In consequence of this blessing, Israel will blush with shame at the thought of its former sins, and will loathe itself for those abominations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-31.htm">Ezekiel 36:31</a>); compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>, where the same thought has already occurred. To this, after repeating what has been said before in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22</a>, namely, that God is not doing all this for the sake of the Israelites themselves, the prophet appends the admonition to be ashamed of their conduct, i.e., to repent, which is so far inserted appropriately in the promise, that the promise itself is meant to entice Israel to repent and return to God. Then, secondly, in two strophes introduced with '&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1497;&#1497;, the promise is still further expanded. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-33.htm">Ezekiel 36:33-36</a>, the prophet shows how the devastated land is to be restored and rebuilt, and to become a paradise; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-37.htm">Ezekiel 36:37</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-38.htm">Ezekiel 36:38</a>, how the people are to be blessed through a large increase in their numbers. Both of these strophes are simply a further elaboration of the promise contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-9.htm">Ezekiel 36:9-12</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, causative of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, to cause to be inhabited, to populate, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-3.htm">Isaiah 54:3</a>. &#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-14.htm">Ezekiel 5:14</a>. The subject to &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-35.htm">Ezekiel 36:35</a> is, "those who pass by." For the comparison to the garden of Eden, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is a circumstantial word belonging to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;: they shall be inhabited as fortified cities, that is to say, shall afford to their inhabitants the security of fortresses, from which there is no fear of their being expelled. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-36.htm">Ezekiel 36:36</a> the expression, "the heathen nations which shall be left round about you," presupposes that at the time of Israel's redemption the judgment will have fallen upon the heathen (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-3.htm">Ezekiel 30:3</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>), so that only a remnant of them will be still in existence; and this remnant will recognise the work of Jehovah in the restoration of Israel. This recognition, however, does not involve the conversion of the heathen to Jehovah, but is simply preparatory to it. For the fact itself, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>. &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to let oneself be asked or entreated, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, with regard to this, is explained by &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; . What God will do follows in '&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;&#1514;&#1493;. God will multiply His people to such an extent, that they will resemble the flock of lambs, sheep, and goats brought to Jerusalem to sacrifice upon the feast days. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7</a>, where Josiah is said to have given to the people thirty thousand lambs and goats for the feast of the passover. &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1488;&#1503; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; does not mean, like a flock of men. &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; cannot be a genitive dependent upon &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, on account of the article in &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1488;&#1503;, but belongs to &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, either as a supplementary apposition to &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, or as a second object, so that &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; would be construed with a double accusative, after the analogy of verbs of plenty, to multiply them in men. Kliefoth's rendering,, "I will multiply them, so that they shall be the flock of men" (of mankind), is grammatically untenable. &#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, a flock of holy beasts, i.e., of sacrificial lambs. The flock of Jerusalem is the flock brought to Jerusalem at the yearly feasts, when the male population of the land came to the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>): So shall the desolate cities be filled again with flocks of men (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>). </body></html>
