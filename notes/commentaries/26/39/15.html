Times of great deliverances should be times of reformation. Every one should help the utmost he can, toward cleansing the land from reproach. Sin is an enemy every man should strive against. Those engaged in public work, especially of cleansing and reforming a land, ought to be men who will go through with what they undertake, who will be always employed. When good work is to be done, every one should further it. Having received special favours from God, let us cleanse ourselves from all evil. It is a work which will require persevering diligence, that search may be made into the secret recesses of sin. The judgments of the Lord, brought upon sin and sinners, are a sacrifice to the justice of God, and a feast to the faith and hope of God's people. See how evil pursues sinners, even after death. After all that ambitious and covetous men do and look for, a place of graves is all the Lord gives them on earth, while their guilty souls are doomed to misery in another world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Men of continual employment - literally, as margin, i. e., men regularly appointed to this business.

And I will save you from all your uncleannesses, and will call the corn, and multiply it, and no more bring famine upon you; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-30.htm">Ezekiel 36:30</a>. But I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that ye will no more bear the reproach of famine among the nations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-31.htm">Ezekiel 36:31</a>. But ye will remember your evil ways, and your deeds which were not good, and will loathe yourselves on account of your iniquities and your abominations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-32.htm">Ezekiel 36:32</a>. Not for your sake do I this, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, be this known to you; be ye ashamed and blush for your ways, O house of Israel! <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-33.htm">Ezekiel 36:33</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, In the day when I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will make the cities inhabited, and the ruins shall be built, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-34.htm">Ezekiel 36:34</a>. And the devastated land shall be tilled instead of being a desert before the eyes of every one who passed by. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-35.htm">Ezekiel 36:35</a>. And men will say, This land, which was laid waste, has become like the garden of Eden, and the desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-36.htm">Ezekiel 36:36</a>. And the nations, which have been left round about you, shall know that I Jehovah build up that which is destroyed, and plant that which is laid waste. I, Jehovah, have said it, and do it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-37.htm">Ezekiel 36:37</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will still let myself be sought by the house of Israel in this, to do it for them; I will multiply them, like a flock, in men; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-38.htm">Ezekiel 36:38</a>. Like a flock of holy sacrifices, like the flock of Jerusalem on its feast-days, so shall the desolate cities be full of flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. - The words '&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; , I help or save you from all your uncleannesses, cannot be understood as relating to their purification from the former uncleannesses; for they have already been cleansed from these, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>. The &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; can only be such defilements as are still possible even after the renewing of the people; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to help, means to guard them against any further recurrence of such defilements (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23</a>), and not to deliver them from the consequences of their former pollutions. But if God preserves His people from these, there is no longer any occasion for a fresh suspension of judgments over them, and God can bestow His blessing upon the sanctified nation without reserve. It is in this way that the further promises are appended; and, first of all, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm">Ezekiel 36:29</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-30.htm">Ezekiel 36:30</a>, a promise that He will bless them with an abundant crop of fruits, both of the orchard and the field. "I call to the corn," i.e., I cause it to come or grow, so that famine will occur no more (for the fact, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-29.htm">Ezekiel 34:29</a>).<p>In consequence of this blessing, Israel will blush with shame at the thought of its former sins, and will loathe itself for those abominations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-31.htm">Ezekiel 36:31</a>); compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>, where the same thought has already occurred. To this, after repeating what has been said before in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22</a>, namely, that God is not doing all this for the sake of the Israelites themselves, the prophet appends the admonition to be ashamed of their conduct, i.e., to repent, which is so far inserted appropriately in the promise, that the promise itself is meant to entice Israel to repent and return to God. Then, secondly, in two strophes introduced with '&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1497;&#1497;, the promise is still further expanded. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-33.htm">Ezekiel 36:33-36</a>, the prophet shows how the devastated land is to be restored and rebuilt, and to become a paradise; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-37.htm">Ezekiel 36:37</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-38.htm">Ezekiel 36:38</a>, how the people are to be blessed through a large increase in their numbers. Both of these strophes are simply a further elaboration of the promise contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-9.htm">Ezekiel 36:9-12</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, causative of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, to cause to be inhabited, to populate, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-3.htm">Isaiah 54:3</a>. &#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-14.htm">Ezekiel 5:14</a>. The subject to &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-35.htm">Ezekiel 36:35</a> is, "those who pass by." For the comparison to the garden of Eden, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is a circumstantial word belonging to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;: they shall be inhabited as fortified cities, that is to say, shall afford to their inhabitants the security of fortresses, from which there is no fear of their being expelled. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-36.htm">Ezekiel 36:36</a> the expression, "the heathen nations which shall be left round about you," presupposes that at the time of Israel's redemption the judgment will have fallen upon the heathen (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-3.htm">Ezekiel 30:3</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>), so that only a remnant of them will be still in existence; and this remnant will recognise the work of Jehovah in the restoration of Israel. This recognition, however, does not involve the conversion of the heathen to Jehovah, but is simply preparatory to it. For the fact itself, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>. &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to let oneself be asked or entreated, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, with regard to this, is explained by &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; . What God will do follows in '&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;&#1514;&#1493;. God will multiply His people to such an extent, that they will resemble the flock of lambs, sheep, and goats brought to Jerusalem to sacrifice upon the feast days. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7</a>, where Josiah is said to have given to the people thirty thousand lambs and goats for the feast of the passover. &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1488;&#1503; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; does not mean, like a flock of men. &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; cannot be a genitive dependent upon &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, on account of the article in &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1488;&#1503;, but belongs to &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, either as a supplementary apposition to &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, or as a second object, so that &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; would be construed with a double accusative, after the analogy of verbs of plenty, to multiply them in men. Kliefoth's rendering,, "I will multiply them, so that they shall be the flock of men" (of mankind), is grammatically untenable. &#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, a flock of holy beasts, i.e., of sacrificial lambs. The flock of Jerusalem is the flock brought to Jerusalem at the yearly feasts, when the male population of the land came to the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>): So shall the desolate cities be filled again with flocks of men (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>). </body></html>
