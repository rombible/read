It is in substance a recapitulation of God's gracious promise to bring again the captivity of Israel, of which the prophet had just been reminded in ver. 23, and to which accordingly he now in thought goes back. It traces the whole course of the Divine dealings with the nation from the point of the exile onwards. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will bring again the captivity of Jacob</span>. (For the use of "Jacob" as a designation of the people, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>.)

That its fulfillment began with the return from Babylon is not inconsistent with the view that its fulfillment will terminate with the final ingathering of Israel out of the nations by her conversion to Christianity, and her consequent admission to the Church. That its first cause will be "mercy" to the whole house of Israel will not prevent that cause from being at the same time a jealous regard for the Divine holiness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21, 22</a>). </body></html>
