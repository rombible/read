There can scarcely be a more striking instance of the working of the hand of Providence in history than the story of the kingdom of Israel during and after the reign of Solomon. Raised as a theocracy to great power and wealth by the Divine blessing, it began to trust in its own beauty. Solomon’s policy was to make it a great and powerful empire among the nations of the earth, losing sight of its true character as the kingdom of God. Consequently the very means he took to aggrandise it became the instruments of its fall. His vast Oriental harem, gathered from all surrounding nations, introduced idolatry into the palace, and fostered it throughout the land. His magnificence was sustained by taxation, which gave the pretext for revolt. The doom was pronounced that the kingdom should be divided, and when this was fulfilled at Solomon’s death, his empire outside the boundaries of Palestine fell apart like a rope of sand, while within, instead of one compact and united monarchy, were two petty kingdoms often in hostility to one another, and each inviting to its assistance the most powerful neighbouring monarchs, to whose rapacity the whole ultimately fell a prey.<p><span class= "bld">Playedst the harlot . . . his it would be.</span>—The political relation of the two parts of Israel just described, placed her at the mercy of every more powerful nation, and gave the impetus to every sort of idolatry which her masters chose to encourage. This apostacy from God, still keeping up the figure of the earlier part of the chapter, is represented as harlotry; and not only so, but as indiscriminate harlotry, for Israel never adopted and clung to any one false God, but worshipped the abominations of every nation which prevailed over her.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/16-15.htm" title="But you did trust in your own beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and poured out your fornications on every one that passed by; his it was....">Ezekiel 16:15-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">But thou didst trust in thine own beauty — </span>Houbigant translates this, “But thou, trusting in thy beauty, didst play the harlot, degenerating from thy renown:” as if he had said, Thou didst abuse those honours, privileges, and advantages which I had bestowed upon thee, and didst make them an occasion of pride, of self-confidence, and of forsaking me thy benefactor, and serving idols. It was chiefly by their frequent and scandalous idolatries that the Jews and Israelites polluted their glory, and profaned the great name of Jehovah. And they presumed upon that very favour which God had showed to Jerusalem, in choosing it for the place of his residence, as if that would secure them from his vengeance, let their idolatries and other wickedness be never so great. <span class="ital">And playedst the harlot</span> — Idolatry, as has been often observed, is expressed by this metaphor. <span class="ital">And of thy garments thou didst take, </span>&c. — This was a great aggravation of their ingratitude, that they applied those very blessings which Jehovah, the true God, had given them, to the worship of idols, contrary to his express command. <span class="ital">And deckedst thy high places — </span>Places of idolatrous worship, commonly built on eminences, <span class="ital">with divers colours. </span>Or, as the LXX. interpret it, <span class="ital">Thou madest idols, </span>or <span class="ital">images, of divers colours. </span>Thou madest little shrines, chapels, or altars for idols, and deckedst them with hangings of divers colours, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-18.htm" title="And took your broidered garments, and covered them: and you have set my oil and my incense before them.">Ezekiel 16:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm" title="And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.">2 Kings 23:7</a>. <span class="ital">The like things shall not come, </span>&c. — I will utterly destroy those idolatries, and those that commit them. <span class="ital">Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels, </span>&c. — The wealth I had bestowed upon thee thou hast laid out in doing honour to idols; and particularly in setting up images to deified heroes, and didst pay them religious worship, here signified by <span class="ital">committing whoredom with them.

Instead of attributing the glory of her privileges and gifts to God, Israel prided herself on them as her own (De 32:15; Jer 7:4; Mic 3:11), and then wantonly devoted them to her idols (Ho 2:8; compare Lu 15:12, 13).<p>playedst &#8230; harlot because of thy renown&#8212;"didst play the wanton upon thy name" [Fairbairn], namely, by allowing thy renown to lead thee into idolatry and leagues with idolaters (Isa 1:21; 57:8; Jer 3:2, 6).

As the Jews did in external gifts bestowed upon them; in their outward prosperity and grandeur; in their riches, wealth, and wisdom; and in the extent of their dominions, as in the days of David and Solomon; and in such things men are apt to; put their trust and confidence, and to be elated with, and grow proud and haughty, as a woman because of her beauty: so some professors of religion trust in a form and profession of it; in speculative knowledge, and in outward duties and services; being unconcerned for inward purity and: holiness; and not trusting in the righteousness of Christ, the real beauty of saints: <p>and playedst the harlot because of thy renown; or "name" (b); which the Jews got among the nations round about them, for their wisdom, riches, and power; which was a snare unto them, as a woman's beauty is to her; and they were admired and courted, and complimented by their neighbours, and so drawn into idolatrous practices, as women into fornication and adultery by the admirers of them: idolatry, which is here meant, is frequently signified by playing the harlot, or by fornication and adultery: or "thou playedst the harlot in thy name" (c); alluding to the custom of harlots, notorious infamous ones, who used to set their names over the apartments, to direct men unto them; and so it may denote how famous and notorious the Jews were for their idolatries, and how impudent in them. Jarchi interprets this of the calf of the wilderness, and other idolatries which the tribe of Dan committed there; but it rather respects the idolatries committed from the times of Solomon to the captivity, which were many, and often repeated; and though sometimes a stop was put to them by pious princes, yet broke out again: so trusting in a man's own righteousness, or in any outward thing, is idolatry; and also false worship and superstitious observances: <p>and pouredst out thy fornication on everyone that passed by: which expresses the multitude of their idolatries; the measure of them, which ran over; the fondness they had for every idol of their neighbours; like a common strumpet, that prostitutes herself to everyone, not only to the men of her own place and city, but to all strangers and travellers; so the Jews, not content with the idols they had, embraced all that offered or their neighbours could furnish them with: <p>his it was; or "to him it was"; her desire, her lust, her fornication; everyone that passed by, that would might enjoy her; so the Jews were reader to fall in with every idol and every idolatrous practice.

The consciousness of her beauty and renown removed from her mind the sense of dependence and responsibility, and she became vain in her own imaginations.

The words obviously point to the policy which Solomon had initiated, of alliances with the heathen and the consequent adoption of their worship. This, as from the earliest days of Israel, was the "whoredom" (Revised Version) of the unfaithful with (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1, 2</a>).

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2</a>. Son of man, show Jerusalem her abominations. - The "abominations" of Jerusalem are the sins of the covenant nation, which were worse than the sinful abominations of Canaan and Sodom. The theme of this word of God is the declaration of these abominations. To this end the nation is first of all shown what it was by nature. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>. And say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem, Thine origin and thy birth are from the land of the Canaanites; thy father was the Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>. And as for thy birth, in the day of thy birth thy navel was not cut, and thou wast not bathed in water for cleansing; and not rubbed with salt, and not wrapped in bandages. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a>. No eye looked upon thee with pity, to do one of these to thee in compassion; but thou wast cast into the field, in disgust at thy life, on the day of thy birth. - According to the allegory, which runs through the whole chapter, the figure adopted to depict the origin of the Israelitish nation is that Jerusalem, the existing representative of the nation, is described as a child, born of Canaanitish parents, mercilessly exposed after its birth, and on the point of perishing. Hitzig and Kliefoth show that they have completely misunderstood the allegory, when they not only explain the statement concerning the descent of Jerusalem, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>, as relating to the city of that name, but restrict it to the city alone, on the ground that "Israel as a whole was not of Canaanitish origin, whereas the city of Jerusalem was radically a Canaanitish, Amoritish, and Hittite city." But were not all the cities of Israel radically Canaanaean? Or was Israel not altogether, but only half, of Aramaean descent? Regarded merely as a city, Jerusalem was neither of Amoritish nor Hittite origin, but simply a Jebusite city. And it is too obvious to need any proof, that the prophetic word does not refer to the city as a city, or to the mass of houses; but that Jerusalem, as the capital of the kingdom of Judah at that time, so far as its inhabitants were concerned, represents the people of Israel, or the covenant nation. It was not the mass of houses, but the population, - which was the foundling, - that excited Jehovah's compassion, and which He multiplied into myriads (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>), clothed in splendour, and chose as the bride with whom He concluded a marriage covenant. The descent and birth referred to are not physical, but spiritual descent. Spiritually, Israel sprang from the land of the Canaanites; and its father was the Amorite ad its mother a Hittite, in the same sense in which Jesus said to the Jews, "Ye are of your father the devil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). The land of the Canaanites is mentioned as the land of the worst heathen abominations; and from among the Canaanitish tribes, the Amorites and Hittites are mentioned as father and mother, not because the Jebusites are placed between the two, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>, as Hitzig supposes, but because they were recognised as the leaders in Canaanitish ungodliness. The iniquity of the Amorites (&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;) was great even in Abraham's time, though not yet full or ripe for destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>); and the daughters of Heth, whom Esau married, caused Rebekah great bitterness of spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-46.htm">Genesis 27:46</a>). These facts furnish the substratum for our description. And they also help to explain the occurrence of &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497; with the article, and &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; without it.

At the birth of the child it did not receive the cleansing and care which were necessary for the preservation and strengthening of its life, but was exposed without pity. The construction &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; (the passive, with an accusative of the object) is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-20.htm">Genesis 40:20</a>, and many other passages of the earlier writings. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1468;&#1514;: for &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm">Judges 6:28</a>), Pual of &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;; and &#1513;&#1512;&#1468;&#1468;&#1498;: from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, with the reduplication of the r, which is very rare in Hebrew (vid., Ewald, 71). By cutting the navel-string, the child is liberated after birth from the blood of the mother, with which it was nourished in the womb. If the cutting be neglected, as well as the tying of the navel-string, which takes place at the same time, the child must perish when the decomposition of the placenta begins. The new-born child is then bathed, to cleanse it from the impurities attaching to it. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497; cannot be derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506;; because neither the meaning to see, to look (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;), nor the other meaning to smear (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506;), yields a suitable sense. Jos. Kimchi is evidently right in deriving it from &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, in Arabic m_', 2 and 4, to wipe off, cleanse. The termination &#1497; is the Aramaean form of the absolute state, for the Hebrew &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;, cleansing (cf. Ewald, 165a). After the washing, the body was rubbed with salt, according to a custom very widely spread in ancient times, and still met with here and there in the East (vid., Hieron. ad h. l. Galen, de Sanit. i. 7; Troilo Reisebeschr. p. 721); and that not merely for the purpose of making the skin drier and firmer, or of cleansing it more thoroughly, but probably from a regard to the virtue of salt as a protection from putrefaction, "to express in a symbolical manner a hope and desire for the vigorous health of the child" (Hitzig and Hvernick). And, finally, it was bound round with swaddling-clothes. Not one of these things, so indispensable to the preservation and strengthening of the child, was performed in the case of Israel at the time of its birth from any feeling of compassionate love (&#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492;, infinitive, to show pity or compassion towards it); but it was cast into the field, i.e., exposed, in order that it might perish &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1506;&#1500;  in disgust at thy life (compare &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, to thrust away, reject, despise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-30.htm">Leviticus 15:30</a>). The day of the birth of Jerusalem, i.e., of Israel, was the period of its sojourn in Egypt, where Israel as a nation was born, - the sons of Jacob who went down to Egypt having multiplied into a nation. The different traits in this picture are not to be interpreted as referring to historical peculiarities, but have their explanation in the totality of the figure. At the same time, they express much more than "that Israel not only stood upon a level with all other nations, so far as its origin and its nature were concerned, but was more helpless and neglected as to both its nature and its natural advantages, possessing a less gifted nature than other nations, and therefore inferior to the rest" (Kliefoth). The smaller gifts, or humbler natural advantages, are thoughts quite foreign to the words of the figure as well as to the context. Both the Canaanitish descent and the merciless exposure of the child point to a totally different point of view, as indicated by the allegory. The Canaanitish descent points to the moral depravity of the nature of Israel; and the neglected condition of the child is intended to show how little there was in the heathen surroundings of the youthful Israel in Canaan and Egypt that was adapted to foster its life and health, or to educate Israel and fit it for its future destination. To the Egyptians the Israelites were an abomination, as a race of shepherds; and not long after the death of Joseph, the Pharaohs began to oppress the growing nation. </body></html>
