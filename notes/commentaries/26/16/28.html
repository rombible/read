Nevertheless they had done so, and in addition to their Egyptian idolatries, had gone to the extent, in the time of Ahaz, of displacing the altar in the court of the Temple, and putting in its stead an altar of the gods of Assyria (2 Kings 16.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference.

Here also the words include political alliances like that of Ahaz with Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>), as well as the adoption of idolatrous worship. The latter probably followed under Ahaz as a consequence of the former, and afterwards spread through the influence of the Assyrian colonists - each nation with its own deities - in Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>).

In close connection with what precedes, this apostasy is described as whoredom and adultery. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15</a>. But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and didst commit fornication upon thy name, and didst pour out thy fornication over every one who passed by: his it became. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16</a>. Thou didst take off thy clothes, and didst make to thyself spotted heights, and didst commit fornication upon them: things which should not come, and that which should not take place. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a>. And thou didst take jewellery of thine ornament of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and didst make thyself male images, and didst commit fornication with them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-18.htm">Ezekiel 16:18</a>. And thou didst take thy embroidered clothes, and didst cover them therewith: and my oil and my incense thou didst set before them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-19.htm">Ezekiel 16:19</a>. And my bread, which I gave to thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst set before them for a pleasant odour: this came to pass, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>. And thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou barest to me, and didst sacrifice them to them to devour. Was thy fornication too little? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a>. Thou didst slay my sons, and didst give them up, devoting them to them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-22.htm">Ezekiel 16:22</a>. And in all thine abominations and thy fornication thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and layest stamping in thy blood. - The beauty, i.e., the glory, of Israel led to its fall, because it made it the ground of its confidence; that is to say, it looked upon the gifts and possessions conferred upon it as its desert; and forgetting the giver, began to traffic with the heathen nations, and allowed itself to be seduced to heathen ways. For the fact, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>. "We are inflamed with pride and arrogance, and consequently profane the gifts of God, in which His glory ought to be resplendent" (Calvin). &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; does not mean either "thou didst commit fornication notwithstanding thy name" (Winer and Ges. Thes. p. 422), or "against thy name" (Hvernick); for &#1506;&#1500; connected with &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; has neither of these meanings, even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-2.htm">Judges 19:2</a>. It means, "thou didst commit fornication upon thy name, i.e., in reliance upon thy name" (Hitzig and Maurer); only we must not understand &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; as referring to the name of the city of God, but must explain it, in accordance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-14.htm">Ezekiel 16:14</a>, as denoting the name, i.e., the renown, which Israel had acquired among the heathen on account of its beauty. In the closing words, &#1500;&#1493; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, &#1500;&#1493; refers to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; stands for &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, the copula having been dropped from &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; because &#1500;&#1493; ought to stand first, and only &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; remaining (compare &#1497;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>). The subject to &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; is &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;; the beauty became his (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>). This fornication is depicted in concrete terms in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16-22</a>; and with the marriage relation described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8-13</a> still in view, Israel is represented as giving up to idolatry all that it had received from its God. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16</a>. With the clothes it made spotted heights for itself. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; stands for &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, temples of heights, small temples erected upon heights by the side of the altars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-32.htm">1 Kings 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>; for the fact, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>), which may probably have consisted simply of tents furnished with carpets. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>, where the women are described as weaving tents for Astarte, also the tent-like temples of the Slavonian tribes in Germany, which consisted of variegated carpets and curtains (see Mohne on Creuzer's Symbolik, V. p. 176). These bamoth Ezekiel calls &#1496;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, not variegated, but spotted or speckled (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a>), possibly with the subordinate idea of patched (&#1502;&#1496;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-5.htm">Joshua 9:5</a>), because they used for the carpets not merely whole garments, but pieces of cloth as well; the word being introduced here for the purpose of indicating contemptuously the worthlessness of such conduct. "Thou didst commit whoredom upon them," i.e., upon the carpets in the tent-temples. The words '&#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; are no doubt relative clauses; but the usual explanation, "which has not occurred, and will not be," after <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-14.htm">Exodus 10:14</a>, cannot be vindicated, as it is impossible to prove either the use of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; in the sense of occurring or happening ( equals  &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;), or the use of the participle instead of the preterite in connection with the future. The participle &#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; in this connection can only supply one of the many senses of the imperfect (Ewald, 168c), and, like &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, express that which ought to be. The participial form &#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is evidently chosen for the sake of obtaining a paronomasia with &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;: the heights which should not come (i.e., should not be erected); while &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; points back to &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;: "what should not happen."</body></html>
