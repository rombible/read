The metaphor of a lewd woman is still carried on; and as one who is lewd for the sake of a maintenance, is more excusable than those who are lewd to gratify their passions, so God here tells the Jewish people, by the prophet, that they had not even the plea, which common harlots had, of practising their sin out of necessity; for that they had never made any advantage of their idolatries, but were subservient to those idolatrous nations, and lavished their riches on them, without reaping any benefit from them. <span class="ital">They give gifts to all whores — </span>That is, to the most of them: it is usual for loose men to do so. <span class="ital">But thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers — </span>By this is signified the large presents they frequently sent to the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Chaldeans, to purchase their friendship. The Jews are often upbraided for making leagues with idolaters, and courting their favours by presents, and by complying with their idolatries. <span class="ital">And the contrary is in thee</span> — The intelligent reader, says Bishop Warburton, perceives that the meaning of the metaphor is, “You Jews are contrary to all other nations; you are fond of borrowing their rites; while none of them care to borrow yours, or to take any of them into their national worship.” See <span class="ital">Div.

This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the land ... - Probably used in the restricted sense of the low lands on the coast of the western sea; occupied by Phoenician colonies. The children of Israel were brought into contact at first with pagans residing within their own borders. Then they extended their contact to foreign nations, trading and forming alliances with Chaldaea, and in so doing were attracted by the idolatries of those with whom they carried on commerce.

The Targum is, <p>"how strong is the wickedness of thy heart!'' <p>the stronger the wickedness of the heart, the weaker, the heart is: <p>seeing thou doest all these things; all the idolatries before mentioned; which was an argument not of her strength, but weakness, and yet of boldness, impudence, and resolution, to have her will: <p>the work of an imperious whorish woman; a whore, as she is impudent, is imperious, is one that rules and governs. The Targum is, who rules over herself; does what she pleases, will have her will and way, and cannot bear any contradiction; and who rules over others, such as are her gallants, obliging them to do as she commands.

The term “heart” (<span class="ital">fem</span>.) occurs nowhere else, and the plur.

LXX. renders: how shall I deal with thy daughter (exactly as <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-9.htm" title="I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the middle of you: and I will not enter into the city.">Hosea 11:9</a> how shall I deal with thee, Ephraim). Our present text lay before the translator: “with thy daughter” is “thy heart” with different points; and “weak” was probably read as part of verb “to fill” (spelled as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-21.htm" title="Till he fill your mouth with laughing, and your lips with rejoicing.">Job 8:21</a>) and rendered freely.

Ewald thinks that the allusion is to Penates (teraphim), which were set up in the house, with ornaments suspended upon them, and worshipped with lectisternia. But there is no more allusion to lectisternia here than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-41.htm">Ezekiel 23:41</a>. And there is still less ground for thinking, as Vatke, Movers, and Hvernick do, of Lingam-or Phallus-worship, of which it is impossible to find the slightest trace among the Israelites. The arguments used by Hvernick have been already proved by Hitzig to have no force whatever. The context does not point to idols of any particular kind, but to the many varieties of Baal-worship; whilst the worship of Moloch is specially mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>. as being the greatest abomination of the whole. The fact that &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, to set before them (the idols), does not refer to lectisternia, but to sacrifices offered as food for the gods, is indisputably evident from the words &#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495;, the technical expression for the sacrificial odour ascending to God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-13.htm">Leviticus 1:13</a>, etc.). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-19.htm">Ezekiel 16:19</a>), and it came to pass (sc., this abomination), merely serves to give emphatic expression to the disgust which it occasioned (Hitzig). - <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a>. And not even content with this, the adulteress sacrificed the children which God had given her to idols. The revulsion of feeling produced by the abominations of the Moloch-worship is shown in the expression &#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;, thou didst sacrifice thy children to idols, that they might devour them; and still more in the reproachful question '&#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, "was there too little in thy whoredom?" &#1502;&#1503; before &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; is used in a comparative sense, though not to signify "was this a smaller thing than thy whoredom?" which would mean far too little in this connection. The &#1502;&#1503; is rather used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, in the sense of too: was thy whoredom, already described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16-19</a>, too little, that thou didst also slaughter thy children to idols? The Chetib &#1514;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-25.htm">Ezekiel 16:25</a>) is a singular, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-25.htm">Ezekiel 16:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-29.htm">Ezekiel 16:29</a>; whereas the Keri has treated it as a plural, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-22.htm">Ezekiel 16:22</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-33.htm">Ezekiel 16:33</a>, but without any satisfactory ground. The indignation comes out still more strongly in the description given of these abominations in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a> : "thou didst slay my sons" (whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a> we have simply "thy sons, whom thou hast born to me"), "and didst give them up to them, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, by making them pass through," sc. the fire. &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;  is used here not merely or lustration or februation by fire, but for the actual burning of the children slain as sacrifices, so that it is equivalent to &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). By the process of burning, the sacrifices were given to Moloch to devour. Ezekiel has the Moloch-worship in his eye in the form which it had assumed from the times of Ahaz downwards, when the people began to burn their children to Moloch (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>), whereas all that can be proved to have been practised in earlier times by the Israelites was the passing of children through fire without either slaying or burning; a februation by fire (compare the remarks on this subject in the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). - Amidst all these abominations Israel did not remember its youth, or how the Lord had adopted it out of the deepest wretchedness to be His people, and had made it glorious through the abundance of His gifts. This base ingratitude shows the depth of its fall, and magnifies its guilt. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-22.htm">Ezekiel 16:22</a> compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6</a>. </body></html>
