Or if the Jews or Israelites be intended, their progenitors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, sojourned in the land of Canaan long before the possession of it was given to their posterity; and the two latter were natives of that country. But as those are said to be our parents, in Scripture language, whose manners we imitate, the Jews or Israelites, may be here represented as being of Canaanitish origin, because they followed the manners of the idolatrous inhabitants of that country, rather than those of the pious patriarchs: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-45.htm" title="You are your mother's daughter, that loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, which loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.">Ezekiel 16:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do.

We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us.

To the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as the Targum: <p>thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; here the Jewish ancestors for a time dwelt and sojourned, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and so the Targum, Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, interpret the first word, "thy habitation" or "sojourning" (f): but whereas it follows, "and thy nativity", this does not solve the difficulty; which may be said to be of the land of Canaan, because their ancestors were born here; for though Abraham was a Chaldean he was called out of Chaldea into the land of Canaan, where Isaac was born; and so was Jacob, the father of the twelve tribes; besides, the Israelites were the successors of the Canaanites in their land, and so seemed to descend from them; and it is not unusual for such to be reckoned the children of those whom they succeed; to which may be added, that they were like to the Canaanites in their manners, particularly in their idolatries; and so their children, as such, are said to be the offspring and descendants of those whose examples they follow, or whom they imitate; see the history of Susannah in the Apocrypha: <p>"So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, and said unto him, O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thine heart.'' (Susannah 1:56) <p>thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite; Abraham and Sarah, who were, properly speaking, the one the father, the other the mother, of the Jewish nation, were Chaldeans; and neither Amorites nor Hittites; yet, because they dwelt among them; are so called; and especially since before their conversion they were idolaters, as those were; besides, the Jews who descended from Judah, and from whom they have their name, very probably sprung from ancestors who might be Amorites and Hittites: since Judah married the daughter of a Canaanite, and such an one seems to be Tamar, he took for his son Er, and by whom he himself had two sons, Pharez and Zarah, from the former of which the kings of Judah lineally descended, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>; besides, the Jews were the successors of these people, and possessed their land, and imitated them in their wicked practices, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-10.htm">Amos 2:10</a>; and these two, the Amorite and Hittite, of all the seven nations, are mentioned, because they were the worst, and the most wicked, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>.

For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, How much more when I send my four evil judgments, sword, and famine, and evil beasts, and pestilence, against Jerusalem, to cut off from it man and beast? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a>. And, behold, there remain escaped ones in her who will be brought out, sons and daughters; behold, they will go out to you, that ye may see their walk and their works; and console yourselves concerning the evil which I have brought upon Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>. And they will console you, when ye see their walk and their works: and ye will see that I have not done without cause all that I have done to her, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - By &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a> the application of the general rule to Jerusalem is made in the form of a reason. The meaning, however, is not, that the reason why Jehovah was obliged to act in this unsparing manner was to be found in the corrupt condition of the nation, as Hvernick supposes, - a thought quite foreign to the context; but &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; indicates that the judgments upon Jerusalem will furnish a practical proof of the general truth expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13-20</a>, and so confirm it. This &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is no more an emphatic yea than the following "&#1488;&#1507; is a forcible introduction to the antithesis formed by the coming fact, to the merely imaginary cases mentioned above" (Hitzig). &#1488;&#1507; has undoubtedly the force of a climax, but not of an asseveration, "verily" (Hv.); a meaning which this particle never has. It is used here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>, in the sense of &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; and the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which follows &#1488;&#1507; swollof hcihw  in this case is a conditional particle of time, "when." Consequently &#1499;&#1497; ought properly to be written twice; but it is only used once, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-5.htm">Ezekiel 15:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14</a>, etc. The thought is this: how much more will this be the case, namely, that even a Noah, Daniel, and Job will not deliver either sons or daughters when I send my judgments upon Jerusalem. The perfect &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is used, and not the imperfect, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13</a>, because God has actually resolved upon sending it, and does not merely mention it as a possible case. The number four is significant, symbolizing the universality of the judgment, or the thought that it will fall on all sides, or upon the whole of Jerusalem; whereby it must also be borne in mind that Jerusalem as the capital represents the kingdom of Judah, or the whole of Israel, so far as it was still in Canaan. At the same time, by the fact that the Lord allows sons and daughters to escape death, and to be led away to Babylon, He forces the acknowledgment of the necessity and righteousness of His judgments among those who are in exile. This is in general terms the thought contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>, to which very different meanings have been assigned by the latest expositors. Hvernick, for example, imagines that, in addition to the four ordinary judgments laid down in the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a> announces a new and extraordinary one; whereas Hitzig and Kliefoth have found in these two verses the consolatory assurance, that in the time of the judgments a few of the younger generation will be rescued and taken to those already in exile in Babylon, there to excite pity as well as to express it, and to give a visible proof of the magnitude of the judgment which has fallen upon Israel. They differ so far from each other, however, that Hitzig regards those of the younger generation who are saved as &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, who have saved themselves through their innocence, but not their guilty parents, and who will excite the commiseration of those already in exile through their blameless conduct; whilst Kliefoth imagines that those who are rescued are simply less criminal than the rest, and when they come to Babylon will be pitied by those who have been longer in exile, and will pity them in return.<p>Neither of these views does justice to the words themselves or to the context. The meaning of. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a> is clear enough; and in the main there has been no difference of opinion concerning it. When man and beast are cut off out of Jerusalem by the four judgments, all will not perish; but &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;, i.e., persons who have escaped destruction, will be left, and will be led out of the city. These are called sons and daughters, with an allusion to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-18.htm">Ezekiel 14:18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-20.htm">Ezekiel 14:20</a>; and consequently we must not take these words as referring to the younger generation in contrast to the older. They will be led out of Jerusalem, not to remain in the land, but to come to "you," i.e., those already in exile, that is to say, to go into exile to Babylon. This does not imply either a modification or a sharpening of the punishment; for the cutting off of man and beast from a town may be effected not only by slaying, but by leading away. The design of God in leaving some to escape, and carrying them to Babylon, is explained in the clauses which follow from &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; onwards, the meaning of which depends partly upon the more precise definition of &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, and partly upon the explanation to be given of &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;  and &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;. The ways and works are not to be taken without reserve as good and righteous works, as Kliefoth has correctly shown in his reply to Hitzig. Still less can ways and works denote their experience or fate, which is the explanation given by Kliefoth of the words, when expounding the meaning and connection of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21-23</a>. The context certainly points to wicked ways and evil works. And it is only the sight of such works that could lead to the conviction that it was not &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, in vain, i.e., without cause, that God had inflicted such severe judgments upon Jerusalem. And in addition to this effect, which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a> as produced upon those who were already in exile, by the sight of the conduct of the &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; that came to Babylon, the immediate design of God is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a> as '&#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The verb &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; with &#1506;&#1500; cannot be used here in the sense of to repent of, or be sorry for, a judgment which God has inflicted upon him, but only of evil which he himself has done; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; does not mean to pity a person, either when construed in the Piel with an accusative of the person, or in the Niphal c. &#1506;&#1500;, rei. &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;  is Niphal, and signifies here to console oneself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12</a> with &#1506;&#1500;, concerning anything, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-39.htm">2 Samuel 13:39</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, etc.; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>), with the accusative of the person, to comfort any one, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/51-21.htm">Genesis 51:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>, etc. But the works and doings of those who came to Babylon could only produce this effect upon those who were already there, from the fact that they were of such a character as to demonstrate the necessity for the judgments which had fallen upon Jerusalem. A conviction of the necessity for the divine judgments would cause them to comfort themselves with regard to the evil inflicted by God; inasmuch as they would see, not only that the punishment endured was a chastisement well deserved, but that God in His righteousness would stay the punishment when it had fulfilled His purpose, and restore the penitent sinner to favour once more. But the consolation which those who were in exile would derive from a sight of the works of the sons and daughters who had escaped from death and come to Babylon, is attributed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a> (&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;) to the persons themselves. It is in this sense that it is stated that "they will comfort you;" not by expressions of pity, but by the sight of their conduct. This is directly affirmed in the words, "when ye shall see their conduct and their works." Consequently <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a> does not contain a new thought, but simply the thought already expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a>, which is repeated in a new form to make it the more emphatic. And the expression &#1488;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; , in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a>, serves to increase the force; whilst &#1488;&#1514;, in the sense of quoad, serves to place the thought to be repeated in subordination to the whole clause (cf. Ewald, 277a, p. 683). </body></html>
