This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After all ... - Besides these things, there was the introduction of other idolatrous rites from the nations with whom Israel had contact. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. woe, woe unto thee, &c.&#8212;This parenthetical exclamation has an awful effect coming like a lightning flash of judgment amidst the black clouds of Israel's guilt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It came to pass; </span> it shall come to pass; so the Hebrew may be read, and then this verse will be a dreadful threat of misery to come upon the Jews for all their wickednesses; when they have filled up the measure of their sins, God will fill them with his judgments, and bring one woe after another upon them, as they proceeded from one wickedness to another. But as we read the words, they are an introduction to a further declaring of this people’s multiplied wickedness, with a dreadful menace introduced somewhat abruptly to express God’s great displeasure against them: the threat is doubled, because it is certainly coming, and will be great when come. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass after all thy wickedness,....

Hosea already stigmatized foreign alliances as whoredoms; it is not, however, so much the political aspect of these alliances as their religious consequences that Ezekiel reprobates. Such alliances were followed by the fashions and worship of the nations with which they were formed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-5.htm" title="O house of Jacob, come you, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.">Isaiah 2:5</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.). Naturally also when Israel became subject to the great eastern empires, the overwhelming influence of these states, with their customs and religions, was widely felt. The gods which had given them universal empire were introduced and worshipped. There appears to have been a great invasion of foreign idolatry in Judah in the declining years of the state, and the kingdom sank to a level in this respect to which the North had never fallen.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto thee,</span> etc.! The interjectional parenthesis, half anathema and half lamentation, looks forward rather than backward. Up to this point Ezekiel had dwelt on the forms of idolatry which were indigenous to Canaan and the nations in immediate contact with it. Now he enters on the later forms of evil which had been adopted from more distant nations. We pass from the time of Solomon to that of Ahaz and Manasseh. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord then went past again, and chose for His bride the virgin, who had already grown up to womanhood, and with whom He contracted marriage by the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, thy time, is more precisely defined as &#1506;&#1514; &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, the time of conjugal love. I spread my wing over thee, i.e., the lappet of my garment, which also served as a counterpane; in other words, I married thee (cf. Ruth. E<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>), and thereby covered thy nakedness. "I swore to thee," sc. love and fidelity (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-21.htm">Hosea 2:21-22</a>), and entered into a covenant with thee, i.e., into that gracious connection formed by the adoption of Israel as the possession of Jehovah, which is represented as a marriage covenant (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2</a> : - &#1488;&#1514;&#1498; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a>. describe how Jehovah provided for the purification, clothing, adorning, and maintenance of His wife. As the bride prepares herself for the wedding by washing and anointing, so did the Lord cleanse Israel from the blemishes and impurities which adhered to it from its birth. The rinsing from the blood must not be understood as specially referring either to the laws of purification given to the nation (Hitzig), or as relating solely to the purification effected by the covenant sacrifice (Hvernick). It embraces all that the Lord did for the purifying of the people from the pollution of sin, i.e., for its sanctification. The anointing with oil indicates the powers of the Spirit of God, which flowed to Israel from the divine covenant of grace. The clothing with costly garments, and adorning with all the jewellery of a wealthy lady or princess, points to the equipment of Israel with all the gifts that promote the beauty and glory of life. The clothing is described as made of the costliest materials with which queens were accustomed to clothe themselves. &#1512;&#1511;&#1502;&#1492;, embroidered cloth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-15.htm">Psalm 45:15</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;, probably the sea-cow, Manati (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-5.htm">Exodus 25:5</a>). The word is used here for a fine description of leather of which ornamental sandals were made; a kind of morocco. "I bound thee round with byssus:" this refers to the headband; for &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; is the technical expression for the binding or winding round of the turban-like headdress (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-13.htm">Leviticus 8:13</a>), and is applied by the Targum to the headdress of the priests. Consequently covering with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, as distinguished from clothing, can only refer to covering with the veil, one of the principal articles of a woman's toilet. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-13.htm">Ezekiel 16:13</a>) is explained by the Rabbins as signifying silk. The lxx render it &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. According to Jerome, this is a word formed by the lxx: quod tantae subtilitatis fuerit vestimentum, ut pilorum et capillorum tenuitatem habere credatur. The jewellery included not only armlets, nose-rings, and ear-rings, which the daughters of Israel were generally accustomed to wear, but also necklaces and a crown, as ornaments worn by princesses and queens. For &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, see comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-13.htm">Ezekiel 16:13</a> sums up the contents of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9-12</a>. Sheeshiy &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is made to conform to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; the food is referred to once more; and the result of the whole is said to have been, that Jerusalem became exceedingly beautiful, and flourished even to royal dignity. The latter cannot be taken as referring simply to the establishment of the monarchy under David, any more than merely to the spiritual sovereignty for which Israel was chosen from the very beginning (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The expression includes both, viz., the call of Israel to be a kingdom of priests, and the historical realization of this call through the Davidic sovereignty. The beauty, i.e., glory, of Israel became so great, that the name of fame of Israel sounded abroad in consequence among the nations. It was perfect, because the Lord had put His glory upon His Church. This, too, we must not restrict (as Hvernick does) to the far-sounding fame of Israel on its departure from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>.); it refers pre-eminently to the glory of the theocracy under David and Solomon, the fame of which spread into all lands. - Thus had Israel been glorified by its God above all the nations, but it did not continue in fellowship with its God. </body></html>
