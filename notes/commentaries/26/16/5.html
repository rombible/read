This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us.

Or, "one of these" (k); not so much as one of them: sad must be the case of an infant, when it meets with no tender heart or kind hand from midwife, nurse, or mother, to do these things for it: this is expressive of the helpless, forlorn, and unpitied state of the Israelites in Egypt; who, when their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, had no mercy shown them by Pharaoh and his taskmasters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>. So the Targum, <p>"the eye of Pharaoh did not spare you to do one good thing for you, to give you rest from your bondage, to have mercy on you:'' <p>but thou wast cast out in the open field; alluding to infants exposed by their unnatural parents, or unkind nurses, and left in an open field, or any desert place, to perish for want, unless some kind providence appears for them: this open field may design the land of Egypt, whither Jacob and his posterity were, being driven out of Canaan by a famine; and where, after the death of Joseph, they were exposed to the hardships and cruelties of the Egyptians; and who, commanding their male children to be slain, doubtless occasioned the exposing of many of them, as well as Moses, to which some reference may be had; and so the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"and he (Pharaoh) decreed a full decree to cast your male children into the river, to destroy you when you were in Egypt:'' <p>to the loathing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born; the Israelites were loathsome to the Egyptians, as every shepherd was an abomination to them, and such were they, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>; and all this may be applied to the state and condition of men by nature, even of God's elect, whose extraction is from fallen man; descend immediately from unclean parents; are conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity; can have no communication of grace from their parents, or others; by whom they cannot be washed from their sins, or sanctified, or clothed, or made righteous; but are in a hopeless and helpless condition; and are loathsome and abominable to God, and to themselves too, when they come to see the state they are in. <p>(k)  "unum ex istis", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Polanus; "unum ex his", Pagninus, Montanus, Starckius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, How much more when I send my four evil judgments, sword, and famine, and evil beasts, and pestilence, against Jerusalem, to cut off from it man and beast? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a>. And, behold, there remain escaped ones in her who will be brought out, sons and daughters; behold, they will go out to you, that ye may see their walk and their works; and console yourselves concerning the evil which I have brought upon Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>. And they will console you, when ye see their walk and their works: and ye will see that I have not done without cause all that I have done to her, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - By &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a> the application of the general rule to Jerusalem is made in the form of a reason. The meaning, however, is not, that the reason why Jehovah was obliged to act in this unsparing manner was to be found in the corrupt condition of the nation, as Hvernick supposes, - a thought quite foreign to the context; but &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; indicates that the judgments upon Jerusalem will furnish a practical proof of the general truth expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13-20</a>, and so confirm it. This &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is no more an emphatic yea than the following "&#1488;&#1507; is a forcible introduction to the antithesis formed by the coming fact, to the merely imaginary cases mentioned above" (Hitzig). &#1488;&#1507; has undoubtedly the force of a climax, but not of an asseveration, "verily" (Hv.); a meaning which this particle never has. It is used here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>, in the sense of &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; and the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which follows &#1488;&#1507; swollof hcihw  in this case is a conditional particle of time, "when." Consequently &#1499;&#1497; ought properly to be written twice; but it is only used once, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-5.htm">Ezekiel 15:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14</a>, etc. The thought is this: how much more will this be the case, namely, that even a Noah, Daniel, and Job will not deliver either sons or daughters when I send my judgments upon Jerusalem. The perfect &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is used, and not the imperfect, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13</a>, because God has actually resolved upon sending it, and does not merely mention it as a possible case. The number four is significant, symbolizing the universality of the judgment, or the thought that it will fall on all sides, or upon the whole of Jerusalem; whereby it must also be borne in mind that Jerusalem as the capital represents the kingdom of Judah, or the whole of Israel, so far as it was still in Canaan. At the same time, by the fact that the Lord allows sons and daughters to escape death, and to be led away to Babylon, He forces the acknowledgment of the necessity and righteousness of His judgments among those who are in exile. This is in general terms the thought contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>, to which very different meanings have been assigned by the latest expositors. Hvernick, for example, imagines that, in addition to the four ordinary judgments laid down in the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a> announces a new and extraordinary one; whereas Hitzig and Kliefoth have found in these two verses the consolatory assurance, that in the time of the judgments a few of the younger generation will be rescued and taken to those already in exile in Babylon, there to excite pity as well as to express it, and to give a visible proof of the magnitude of the judgment which has fallen upon Israel. They differ so far from each other, however, that Hitzig regards those of the younger generation who are saved as &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, who have saved themselves through their innocence, but not their guilty parents, and who will excite the commiseration of those already in exile through their blameless conduct; whilst Kliefoth imagines that those who are rescued are simply less criminal than the rest, and when they come to Babylon will be pitied by those who have been longer in exile, and will pity them in return.<p>Neither of these views does justice to the words themselves or to the context. The meaning of. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a> is clear enough; and in the main there has been no difference of opinion concerning it. When man and beast are cut off out of Jerusalem by the four judgments, all will not perish; but &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;, i.e., persons who have escaped destruction, will be left, and will be led out of the city. These are called sons and daughters, with an allusion to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-18.htm">Ezekiel 14:18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-20.htm">Ezekiel 14:20</a>; and consequently we must not take these words as referring to the younger generation in contrast to the older. They will be led out of Jerusalem, not to remain in the land, but to come to "you," i.e., those already in exile, that is to say, to go into exile to Babylon. This does not imply either a modification or a sharpening of the punishment; for the cutting off of man and beast from a town may be effected not only by slaying, but by leading away. The design of God in leaving some to escape, and carrying them to Babylon, is explained in the clauses which follow from &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; onwards, the meaning of which depends partly upon the more precise definition of &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, and partly upon the explanation to be given of &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;  and &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;. The ways and works are not to be taken without reserve as good and righteous works, as Kliefoth has correctly shown in his reply to Hitzig. Still less can ways and works denote their experience or fate, which is the explanation given by Kliefoth of the words, when expounding the meaning and connection of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21-23</a>. The context certainly points to wicked ways and evil works. And it is only the sight of such works that could lead to the conviction that it was not &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, in vain, i.e., without cause, that God had inflicted such severe judgments upon Jerusalem. And in addition to this effect, which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a> as produced upon those who were already in exile, by the sight of the conduct of the &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; that came to Babylon, the immediate design of God is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a> as '&#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The verb &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; with &#1506;&#1500; cannot be used here in the sense of to repent of, or be sorry for, a judgment which God has inflicted upon him, but only of evil which he himself has done; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; does not mean to pity a person, either when construed in the Piel with an accusative of the person, or in the Niphal c. &#1506;&#1500;, rei. &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;  is Niphal, and signifies here to console oneself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12</a> with &#1506;&#1500;, concerning anything, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-39.htm">2 Samuel 13:39</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, etc.; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>), with the accusative of the person, to comfort any one, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/51-21.htm">Genesis 51:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>, etc. But the works and doings of those who came to Babylon could only produce this effect upon those who were already there, from the fact that they were of such a character as to demonstrate the necessity for the judgments which had fallen upon Jerusalem. A conviction of the necessity for the divine judgments would cause them to comfort themselves with regard to the evil inflicted by God; inasmuch as they would see, not only that the punishment endured was a chastisement well deserved, but that God in His righteousness would stay the punishment when it had fulfilled His purpose, and restore the penitent sinner to favour once more. But the consolation which those who were in exile would derive from a sight of the works of the sons and daughters who had escaped from death and come to Babylon, is attributed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a> (&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;) to the persons themselves. It is in this sense that it is stated that "they will comfort you;" not by expressions of pity, but by the sight of their conduct. This is directly affirmed in the words, "when ye shall see their conduct and their works." Consequently <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a> does not contain a new thought, but simply the thought already expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a>, which is repeated in a new form to make it the more emphatic. And the expression &#1488;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; , in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a>, serves to increase the force; whilst &#1488;&#1514;, in the sense of quoad, serves to place the thought to be repeated in subordination to the whole clause (cf. Ewald, 277a, p. 683). </body></html>
