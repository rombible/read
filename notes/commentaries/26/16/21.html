This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Borne unto me - me is emphatic.

I spread my wing over thee, i.e., the lappet of my garment, which also served as a counterpane; in other words, I married thee (cf. Ruth. E<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>), and thereby covered thy nakedness. "I swore to thee," sc. love and fidelity (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-21.htm">Hosea 2:21-22</a>), and entered into a covenant with thee, i.e., into that gracious connection formed by the adoption of Israel as the possession of Jehovah, which is represented as a marriage covenant (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2</a> : - &#1488;&#1514;&#1498; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a>. describe how Jehovah provided for the purification, clothing, adorning, and maintenance of His wife. As the bride prepares herself for the wedding by washing and anointing, so did the Lord cleanse Israel from the blemishes and impurities which adhered to it from its birth. The rinsing from the blood must not be understood as specially referring either to the laws of purification given to the nation (Hitzig), or as relating solely to the purification effected by the covenant sacrifice (Hvernick). It embraces all that the Lord did for the purifying of the people from the pollution of sin, i.e., for its sanctification. The anointing with oil indicates the powers of the Spirit of God, which flowed to Israel from the divine covenant of grace. The clothing with costly garments, and adorning with all the jewellery of a wealthy lady or princess, points to the equipment of Israel with all the gifts that promote the beauty and glory of life. The clothing is described as made of the costliest materials with which queens were accustomed to clothe themselves. &#1512;&#1511;&#1502;&#1492;, embroidered cloth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-15.htm">Psalm 45:15</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;, probably the sea-cow, Manati (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-5.htm">Exodus 25:5</a>). The word is used here for a fine description of leather of which ornamental sandals were made; a kind of morocco. "I bound thee round with byssus:" this refers to the headband; for &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; is the technical expression for the binding or winding round of the turban-like headdress (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-13.htm">Leviticus 8:13</a>), and is applied by the Targum to the headdress of the priests. Consequently covering with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, as distinguished from clothing, can only refer to covering with the veil, one of the principal articles of a woman's toilet. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-13.htm">Ezekiel 16:13</a>) is explained by the Rabbins as signifying silk. The lxx render it &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. According to Jerome, this is a word formed by the lxx: quod tantae subtilitatis fuerit vestimentum, ut pilorum et capillorum tenuitatem habere credatur. The jewellery included not only armlets, nose-rings, and ear-rings, which the daughters of Israel were generally accustomed to wear, but also necklaces and a crown, as ornaments worn by princesses and queens. For &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, see comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-13.htm">Ezekiel 16:13</a> sums up the contents of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9-12</a>. Sheeshiy &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is made to conform to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; the food is referred to once more; and the result of the whole is said to have been, that Jerusalem became exceedingly beautiful, and flourished even to royal dignity. The latter cannot be taken as referring simply to the establishment of the monarchy under David, any more than merely to the spiritual sovereignty for which Israel was chosen from the very beginning (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The expression includes both, viz., the call of Israel to be a kingdom of priests, and the historical realization of this call through the Davidic sovereignty. The beauty, i.e., glory, of Israel became so great, that the name of fame of Israel sounded abroad in consequence among the nations. It was perfect, because the Lord had put His glory upon His Church. This, too, we must not restrict (as Hvernick does) to the far-sounding fame of Israel on its departure from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>.); it refers pre-eminently to the glory of the theocracy under David and Solomon, the fame of which spread into all lands. - Thus had Israel been glorified by its God above all the nations, but it did not continue in fellowship with its God. </body></html>
