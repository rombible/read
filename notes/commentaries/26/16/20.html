The sacrifice of children<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehovah is the husband of the idealized community, and the individual members are his children. Human sacrifices, though rare, were not altogether unknown in early Israel, as the instance of Jephthah proves (Judges 11). They were probably more common among the Canaanites and neighbouring peoples, though perhaps even among them resorted to only on occasions of great trial, in the hope of appeasing the anger or securing the favour of the deity (cf. the tragic story of the king of Moab, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm" title="Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.">2 Kings 3:27</a>). Instances of human sacrifices do not occur in the early history of Israel, for neither the slaughter of Agag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm" title="And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.">1 Samuel 15:33</a>) nor the hanging of seven descendants of Saul (2 Samuel 21) comes strictly under the idea of a sacrifice; but Ahaz king of Judah is said to have passed his son through the fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm" title="But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.">2 Kings 16:3</a>), and the practice introduced by him was followed by Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm" title="And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2 Kings 21:6</a>), and must have spread among the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm" title="And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.">Jeremiah 32:35</a>). The phrase “to pass through the fire” might be taken to mean merely a lustration or purification by fire, not implying the death of the child. This cannot, however, have been the case, for this prophet uses the words sacrifice (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm" title="Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and these have you sacrificed to them to be devoured.

The child, of course, was not burnt alive, but slain like other sacrifices, and offered as a burnt offering. The practice was a widespread one in the East, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-31.htm" title="And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.">2 Kings 17:31</a>.

It will be noticed that the words, "the fire," are in italics, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are not in the Hebrew, the verb "to pass through" having acquired so technical a meaning that it was enough without that addition.

Thy name went forth among the nations on account of thy beauty; for it was perfect through my glory, which I put upon thee, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - The description of what the Lord did for Israel in His compassionate love is divided into two sections by the repetition of the phrase "I passed by thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>). The first embraces what God had done for the preservation and increase of the nation; the second, what He had done for the glorification of Israel, by adopting it as the people of His possession. When Israel was lying in the field as a neglected new-born child, the Lord passed by and adopted it, promising it life, and giving it strength to live. To bring out the magnitude of the compassion of God, the fact that the child was lying in its blood is mentioned again and again. The explanation to be given of &#1502;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505;&#1514; (the Hithpolel of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, to trample upon, tread under foot) is doubtful, arising from the difficulty of deciding whether the Hithpolel is to be taken in a passive or a reflective sense. The passive rendering, "trampled upon" (Umbreit), or ad conculcandum projectus, thrown down, to be trodden under foot (Gesenius, etc.), is open to the objection that the Hophal is used for this. We therefore prefer the reflective meaning, treading oneself, or stamping; as the objection offered to this, namely, that a new-born child thrown into a field would not be found stamping with the feet, has no force in an allegorical description. In the clause <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6</a>, which is written twice, the question arises whether &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; is to be taken with &#1495;&#1497;&#1497; or with &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; : I said to thee, "In thy blood live;" or, "I said to thee in thy blood, 'Live.' " We prefer the former, because it gives a more emphatic sense. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; is a concise expression; for although lying in thy blood, in which thou wouldst inevitably bleed to death, yet thou shalt live. Hitzig's proposal to connect &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; in the first clause with &#1495;&#1497;&#1497; , and in the second with &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, can hardly be entertained. A double construction of this kind is not required either by the repetition of &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1498;, or by the uniform position of &#1489;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; before &#1495;&#1497;&#1497; in both clauses, as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-18.htm">1 Kings 20:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-5.htm">Isaiah 27:5</a>.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a> the description of the real fact breaks through the allegory. The word of God &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;, live, was visibly fulfilled in the innumerable multiplication of Israel. But the allegory is resumed immediately. The child grew (&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-20.htm">Genesis 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a>), and came into ornament of cheeks (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; with &#1489;&#1468;, to enter into a thing, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>; not to proceed in, as Hitzig supposes). &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, not most beautiful ornament, or highest charms, for &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; is not the plural of &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;; but according to the Chetib and most of the editions, with the tone upon the penultima, is equivalent to &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, a dual form; so that &#1506;&#1491;&#1497; cannot mean ornament in this case, but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>, "the cheek," which is the traditional meaning (cf. Ges. Thes. p. 993). Ornament of cheeks is youthful freshness and beauty of face. The clauses which follow describe the arrival of puberty. &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, when applied to the breasts, means to expand, lit., to raise oneself up. &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, pubes. The description given in these verses refers to the preservation and marvellous multiplication of Israel in Egypt, where the sons of Israel grew into a nation under the divine blessing. Still it was quite naked and bare (&#1506;&#1512;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; are substantives in the abstract sense of nakedness and bareness, used in the place of adjective to give greater emphasis). Naked and bare are figurative expressions for still destitute of either clothing or ornaments. This implies something more than "the poverty of the people in the wilderness attached to Egypt" (Hitzig). Nakedness represents deprivation of all the blessings of salvation with which the Lord endowed Israel and made it glorious, after He had adopted it as the people of His possession. In Egypt, Israel was living in a state of nature, destitute of the gracious revelations of God.</body></html>
