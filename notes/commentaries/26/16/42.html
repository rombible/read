This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us.

When the Jews should cease from their idolatries, and no more worship the gods of the nations, then the fury of the Lord, and the effects of it, should cease: God no longer contends with a people than while they are sinning; when a reformation is brought about, by afflictions or judgments, his end is answered, and he puts a stop to the spread of his wrath and fury; or if is made to rest, because there is nothing left for it to work upon, a total consumption of people and substance being made by it: or it may be rendered, "I will make my fury to rest upon thee" (t); and the sense be, that his wrath should abide upon them, and not remove until an utter end was made of them; though the first sense seems best to agree with what goes before, and follows after: <p>and my jealousy shall depart from thee; as it does from a man when he has utterly rejected his wife because of whoredom, and is divorced from her; and his burning jealousy has satisfied itself, and there is no other way to operate and show itself in; or when a woman returns to her husband and gives him satisfaction, keeps close unto him, and lives chastely with him, having relinquished her former lewd ways and practices: <p>and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry: the effects of his anger cease, his judgments averted, and he at peace with them, and they with him; for he retains not his anger for ever: though some understand this of his being quiet and at ease in the destruction of the Jews; there being no more to wreak his vengeance upon. <p>(t)   "et requiescere faciam iram meam in te", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatsblus, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</span><p>(t) I will utterly destroy you and so my jealousy will cease.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">42</span>. <span class="ital">make my fury … to rest</span>] i.e. satisfy and appease it.

For here the forms of punishment were not final The daughter of Zion survived the stoning, the sword, and the burning. And so, when wrath had done its work of retribution, it might become corrective and purgatorial. The injured husband, in the bold anthropomorphic language of the parable, would be no more angry. The Lord God of Israel would remember his covenant, and forgive. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Extent and Magnitude of the Idolatry<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-23.htm">Ezekiel 16:23</a>.

For all sin, all evil, must first exist before it can spread. The spreading of idolatry was at the same time an increase of apostasy from God. This is not to be sought, however, in the face that Israel forsook the sanctuary, which God had appointed for it as the scene of His gracious presence, and built itself idol-temples (Kliefoth). It consisted rather in this, that it erected idolatrous altars and little temples at all street-corners and cross-roads (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-24.htm">Ezekiel 16:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-25.htm">Ezekiel 16:25</a>), and committed adultery with all heathen nations (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-26.htm">Ezekiel 16:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-28.htm">Ezekiel 16:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-29.htm">Ezekiel 16:29</a>), and could not be induced to relinquish idolatry either by the chastisements of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-27.htm">Ezekiel 16:27</a>), or by the uselessness of such conduct (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-32.htm">Ezekiel 16:32-34</a>). &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1498; is the whole of the apostasy from the Lord depicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15-22</a>, which prevailed more and more as idolatry spread. The picture of this extension of idolatry is introduced with woe! woe! to indicate at the outset the fearful judgment which Jerusalem was bringing upon itself thereby. The exclamation of woe is inserted parenthetically; for &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-24.htm">Ezekiel 16:24</a>) forms the apodosis to &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-23.htm">Ezekiel 16:23</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489; and &#1512;&#1502;&#1492; are to be taken as general terms; but, as the singular &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498; with the plural &#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-39.htm">Ezekiel 16:39</a> plainly shows, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489; is a collective word. Hvernick has very properly called attention to the analogy between &#1490;&#1468;&#1489; and &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, which is used there to denote an apartment furnished or used for the service of Baal-peor. As &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, from &#1511;&#1489;&#1489;, signifies literally that which is arched, a vault; so &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;, is literally that which is curved or arched, a hump or back, and hence is used here for buildings erected for idolatrous purposes, small temples built on heights, which were probably so called to distinguish them as chapels for fornication. The ancient translations suggest this, viz.: lxx &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; and &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, which Polychron. explains thus: &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;; Vulg.: lupanar and prostibulum. &#1512;&#1502;&#1492; signifies artificial heights, i.e., altars built upon eminences, commonly called ba&#770;mo&#772;th. The word ra&#770;&#770;&#770;ma&#770;h is probably chosen here with an allusion to the primary signification, height, as Jerome has said: quod excelsus sit ut volentibus fornicari procul appareat fornicationis locus et non necesse sit quaeri.<p>The increase of the whoredom, i.e., of the idolatry and illicit intercourse with heathenish ways, is individualized in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-26.htm">Ezekiel 16:26-29</a> by a specification of historical facts. We cannot agree with Hitzig in restricting the illicit intercourse with Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-26.htm">Ezekiel 16:26</a>), Asshur (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-28.htm">Ezekiel 16:28</a>), and Chaldaea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-29.htm">Ezekiel 16:29</a>) to political apostasy, as distinguished from the religious apostasy already depicted. There is nothing to indicate any such distinction. Under the figure of whoredom, both in what precedes and what follows, the inclination of Israel to heathen ways in all its extent, both religious and political, is embraced. Egypt stands first; for the apostasy of Israel from the Lord commenced with the worship of the golden calf, and the longing in the wilderness for the fleshpots of Egypt. From time immemorial Egypt was most deeply sunken in the heathenish worship of nature. The sons of Egypt as therefore described, in accordance with the allegory, as &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1497; , magni carne (ba&#770;za&#770;r, a euphemism; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-20.htm">Ezekiel 23:20</a>), i.e., according to the correct explanation of Theodoret: &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8; &#787;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;. The way in which God punished this erring conduct was, that, like a husband who endeavours by means of chastisement to induce his faithless wife to return, He diminished the supply of food, clothing, etc. (cho&#772;g, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8</a>), intended for the wife (for the fact compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-9.htm">Hosea 2:9-10</a>); this He did by "not allowing Israel to attain to the glory and power which would otherwise have been conferred upon it; that is to say, by not permitting it to acquire the undisturbed and undivided possession of Canaan, but giving it up to the power and scorn of the princes of the Philistines" (Kliefoth). &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, to give any one up to the desire of another. The daughters of the Philistines are the Philistian states, corresponding to the representation of Israel as an adulterous wife. The Philistines are mentioned as the principal foes, because Israel fell completely into their power at the end of the period of the Judges (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13.htm">Judges 13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>); and they are referred to here, for the deeper humiliation of Israel, as having been ashamed of the licentious conduct of the Israelites, because they adhered to their gods, and did not exchange them for others as Israel had done (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10-11</a>). &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (v. 27) is in apposition to &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1498;: thy way, which is zimma&#770;h. Zimma&#770;h is applied to the sin of profligacy, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>. - But Israel was not improved by this chastisement. It committed adultery with Asshur also from the times of Ahaz, who sought help from the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>.); and even with this it was not satisfied; that is to say, the serious consequences brought upon the kingdom of Judah by seeking the friendship of Assyria did not sober it, so as to lead it to give up seeking for help from the heathen and their gods. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-28.htm">Ezekiel 16:28</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; is distinguished from &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1494;&#1504;&#1492;, with accus.). The former denotes the immoral pursuit of a person for the purpose of procuring his favour; the latter, adulterous intercourse with him, when his favour has been secured. The thought of the verse is this: Israel sought the favour of Assyria, because it was not satisfied with illicit intercourse with Egypt, and continued to cultivate it; yet it did not find satisfaction or sufficiency even in this, but increased its adultery &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, to the Canaan's-land Chaldaea. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503; is not the proper name of the land of Canaan here, but an appellative designation applied to Chaldaea (Kasdim) or Babylonia, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-4.htm">Ezekiel 17:4</a> (Raschi). The explanation of the words, as signifying the land of Canaan, is precluded by the fact that an allusion to Canaanitish idolatry and intercourse after the mention of Asshur would be out of place, and would not coincide with the historical order of things; since it cannot be shown that "a more general diffusion of the religious customs of Canaan took place after the Assyrian era." And it is still more decidedly precluded by the introduction of the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, which cannot possibly mean as far as, or unto, Chaldaea, and can only be a more precise definition of &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503;. The only thing about which a question can be raised, is the reason why the epithet &#1499;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503; should have been applied to Chaldaea; whether it merely related to the commercial spirit, in which Babylon was by no means behind the Canaanitish Tyre and Sidon, or whether allusion was also made to the idolatry and immorality of Canaan. The former is by no means to be excluded, as we find that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-4.htm">Ezekiel 17:4</a> "the land of Canaan" is designated "a city of merchants" (ro&#772;khelim). But we must not exclude the latter either, inasmuch as in the Belus- and Mylitta-worship of Babylon the voluptuous character of the Baal- and Astarte-worship of Canaan had degenerated into shameless unchastity (cf. Herodotus, i.199).<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-30.htm">Ezekiel 16:30</a>, the contents of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16-29</a> are summed up in the verdict which the Lord pronounces upon the harlot and adulteress: "yet how languishing is thy heart!" &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492; (as a participle Kal &#x3b1;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;..; since the verb only occurs elsewhere in the Pual, and that in the sense of faded or pining away) can only signify a morbid pining or languishing, or the craving of immodest desire, which has grown into a disease. The form &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; is also &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;..; but it is analogous to the plural &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;.<p>(Note: Hitzig objects to the two forms, which do not occur elsewhere; and with the help of the Sept. rendering &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, which is a mere guess founded upon the false reading &#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492;, he adopts the conjectural reading &#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, "what hope is there for thy daughter?" by which he enriches the Hebrew language with a new word (&#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492; ), and the prophecy contained in this chapter with a thought which is completely foreign to it, and altogether unsuitable.)<p>&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1514;, powerful, commanding; as an epithet applied to zo&#772;na&#770;h, one who knows no limit to her actions, unrestrained; hence in Arabic, insolent, shameless. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-31.htm">Ezekiel 16:31</a> contains an independent sentence, which facilitates the transition to the thought expanded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-32.htm">Ezekiel 16:32-34</a>, namely, that Jerusalem had surpassed all other harlots in her whoredoms. If we take <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-31.htm">Ezekiel 16:31</a> as dependent upon the protasis in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-30.htm">Ezekiel 16:30</a>, we not only get a very dragging style of expression, but the new thought expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-31.htm">Ezekiel 16:31</a> is reduced to a merely secondary idea; whereas the expansion of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-32.htm">Ezekiel 16:32</a>. shows that it introduces a new feature into the address. And if this is the case, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; cannot be taken as co-ordinate with &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; htiw etanidro-oc, but must be construed as the apodosis: "in thy building of rooms...thou wast not like the (ordinary) harlot, since thou disdainest payment." For the plural suffix attached to &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, see the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-8.htm">Ezekiel 6:8</a>. The infinitive &#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505; answers to the Latin gerund in ndo (vid., Ewald, 237c and 280d), indicating wherein, or in what respect, the harlot Jerusalem differed from an ordinary prostitute; namely, in the fact that she disdained to receive payment for her prostitution. That this is the meaning of the words, is rendered indisputable by <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-32.htm">Ezekiel 16:32-34</a>. But the majority of expositors have taken &#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505;  as indicating the point of comparison between Israel and other harlots, i.e., as defining in what respect Israel resembled other prostitutes; and then, as this thought is at variance with what follows, have attempted to remove the discrepancy by various untenable explanations. Most of them resort to the explanation: thou wast not like the other prostitutes, who disdain to receive their payment offered for their prostitution, in the hope of thereby obtaining still more,<p>(Note: Jerome adopts this rendering: non facta es quasi meretrix fastidio augens pretium, and gives the following explanation: "thou hast not imitated the cunning prostitutes, who are accustomed to raise the price of lust by increasing the difficulties, and in this way to excite their lovers to greater frenzy." Rosenmller and Maurer have adopted a similar explanation: "thou differest greatly from other harlots, who despise the payment offered them by their lovers, that they may get still more; for thou acceptest any reward, being content with the lowest payment; yea, thou dost even offer a price to thine own lovers.")<p>an explanation which imports into the words a thought that has no existence in them at all. Hvernick seeks to fix upon &#1511;&#1500;&#1505;, by means of the Aramaean, the meaning to cry out (crying out payment), in opposition to the ordinary meaning of &#1511;&#1500;&#1505;, to disdain, or ridicule, in which sense Ezekiel also uses the noun &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-4.htm">Ezekiel 22:4</a>. Hitzig falls back upon the handy method of altering the text; and finally, Kliefoth gives to &#1500; the imaginary meaning "so far as," i.e., "to such a degree that," which cannot be defended either through <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-19.htm">Exodus 39:19</a> or from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a>.<p>With the loose way in which the infinitive construct with &#1500; is used, we grant that the words are ambiguous, and might have the meaning which the majority of the commentators have discovered in them; but this view is by no means necessary, inasmuch as the subordinate idea introduced by &#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505; &#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1503; may refer quite as well to the subject of the sentence, "thou," as to the zo&#772;na&#770;h with whom the subject is compared. Only in the latter case the &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505; would apply to other harlots as well as to Israel; whereas in the former it applies to Israel alone, and shows in what it was that Israel did not resemble ordinary prostitutes. But the explanation which followed was a sufficient safeguard against mistake. In this explanation adulteresses are mentioned first (v. 32), and then common prostitutes (vv. 33, 34). V. 32 must not be taken, as it has been by the majority of commentators, as an exclamation, or a reproof addressed to the adulteress Jerusalem: O thou adulterous wife, that taketh strangers instead of her husband! Such an exclamation as this does not suit the connection at all. But the verse is not to be struck out on that account, as Hitzig proposes. It has simply to be construed in another way, and taken as a statement of what adulteresses do (Kliefoth). They take strangers instead of their husband, and seek their recompense in the simple change, and the pleasure of being with other men. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468;, lit., under her husband, i.e., as a wife subject to her husband, as in the connection with &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-5.htm">Ezekiel 23:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a> (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-19.htm">Numbers 5:19</a>). - <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-33.htm">Ezekiel 16:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-34.htm">Ezekiel 16:34</a>. Common prostitutes give themselves up for presents; but Israel, on the contrary, gave presents to its lovers, so that it did the very opposite to all other harlots, and the practice of ordinary prostitutes was left far behind by that of Israel. The change of forms  &#1504;&#1491;&#1488; and &#1504;&#1491;&#1503; (a present) is probably to be explained simply on the ground that the form &#1504;&#1491;&#1488; was lengthened into &#1504;&#1491;&#1503; with a consonant as the termination, because the suffix could be attached more easily to the other. &#1492;&#1508;&#1498;, the reverse, the opposite, i.e., with the present context, something unheard of, which never occurred in the case of any other harlot. - Ezekiel has thus fulfilled the task appointed him in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2</a>, to charge Jerusalem with her abominations. The address now turns to an announcement of the punishment. </body></html>
