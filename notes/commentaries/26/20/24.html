The history of Israel in the wilderness is referred to in the new Testament as well as in the Old, for warning. God did great things for them. He gave them the law, and revived the ancient keeping of the sabbath day. Sabbaths are privileges; they are signs of our being his people. If we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to our comfort, it is the Lord that makes us holy, that is, truly happy, here; and prepares us to be happy, that is, perfectly holy, hereafter. The Israelites rebelled, and were left to the judgments they brought upon themselves. God sometimes makes sin to be its own punishment, yet he is not the Author of sin: there needs no more to make men miserable, than to give them up to their own evil desires and passions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The book of Deuteronomy contains the address to "the children" of those who perished in the wilderness.

And I led them out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the desert; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a>. And gave them my statutes, and my rights I made known to them, which man is to do that he may live through them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-12.htm">Ezekiel 20:12</a>. I also gave them my Sabbaths, that they might be for a sign between me and them, that they might now that I Jehovah sanctify them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a>. But the house of Israel was rebellious against me in the desert: they did not walk in my statutes, and my rights they rejected, which man is to do, that he may live through them, and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned: Then I thought to pour out my wrath upon them in the desert to destroy them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-14.htm">Ezekiel 20:14</a>. But I did it for my name's sake, that it might not be profaned before the eyes of the nations, before whose eyes I had led them out. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-15.htm">Ezekiel 20:15</a>. I also lifted my hand to them in the desert, not to bring them into the land which I had given (them), which floweth with milk and honey; it is an ornament of all lands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-16.htm">Ezekiel 20:16</a>. Because they rejected my rights, did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths, for their heart went after their idols. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-17.htm">Ezekiel 20:17</a>. But my eye looked with pity upon them, so that I did not destroy them, and make an end of them in the desert. - God gave laws at Sinai to the people whom He had brought out of Egypt, through which they were to be sanctified as His own people, that they might live before God. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a> compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-12.htm">Ezekiel 20:12</a> is taken almost word for word from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>, where God concludes the directions for His worship by urging upon the people in the most solemn manner the observance of His Sabbaths, and thereby pronounces the keeping of the Sabbath the kernel of all divine worship. And as in that passage we are to understand by the Sabbaths the actual weekly Sabbaths, and not the institutions of worship as a whole, so here we must retain the literal signification of the word. It is only of the Sabbath recurring every week, and not of all the fasts, that it could be said it was a sign between Jehovah and Israel. It was a sign, not as a token, that they who observed it were Israelites, as Hitzig supposes, but to know (that they might know) that Jehovah was sanctifying them, namely, by the Sabbath rest - as a refreshing and elevation of the mind, in which Israel was to have a foretaste of that blessed resting from all works to which the people of God was ultimately to attain (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>). It is from this deeper signification of the Sabbath that the prominence given to the Sabbaths here is to be explained, and not from the outward circumstance that in exile, when the sacrificial worship was necessarily suspended, the keeping of the Sabbath as the only bond which united the Israelites, so far as the worship of God was concerned (Hitzig). Historical examples of the rebellion of Israel against the commandments of God in the desert are given in ex. E<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/32-1.htm">Zechariah 32:1-6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>; and of the desecration of the Sabbath, in ex. E<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/16-27.htm">Zechariah 16:27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32</a>. For the threat referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-12</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-15.htm">Ezekiel 20:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-16.htm">Ezekiel 20:16</a> are not a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a> (Hitzig); nor do they introduce a limitation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-14.htm">Ezekiel 20:14</a> (Kliefoth). They simply relate what else God did to put bounds to the rebellion after He had revoked the decree to cut Israel off, at the intercession of Moses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-19</a>). He lifted His hand to the oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>.), that the generation which had come out of Egypt should not come into the land of Canaan, but should die in the wilderness. Therewith He looked with pity upon the people, so that He did not make an end of them by following up the threat with a promise that the children should enter the land. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-13.htm">Ezekiel 11:13</a>. </body></html>
