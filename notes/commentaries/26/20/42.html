There is no shaking off God's dominion; and those who will not yield to the power of his grace, shall sink under the power of his wrath. But not one of God's jewels shall be lost in the lumber of this world. He will bring the jews to the land of Israel again; and will give them true repentance. They will be overcome with his kindness: the more we know of God's holiness, the more we see the hateful nature of sin. Those who remain unaffected amidst means of grace, and would live without Christ, like the world around them, may be sure it is the way to destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This points to the consummation indicated by the vision of the temple.<p>In the mountain of the height - Or, Upon a very high mountain <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>.

Therefore speak to the house of Israel, O son of man, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Still further have your fathers blasphemed me in this, with the faithlessness which they have shown toward me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28</a>. When I had brought them into the land, which I had lifted my hand to give them, then they looked out every high hill and every thickly covered tree, and offered their sacrifices there, and gave their irritating gifts there, and presented the fragrance of their pleasant odour there, and poured out their drink-offerings there. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-29.htm">Ezekiel 20:29</a>.

And defile yourselves in all your idols to this day, by lifting up your gifts, and causing your sons to pass through the fire; and should I let myself be inquired of by you? As I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, I will not let myself be inquired of by you. - The &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-27.htm">Ezekiel 20:27</a> is resumed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30</a>; and there the answer given by God to the elders, who had come to inquire of Him, is first communicated, after an express declaration of the fact that Israel had continued its idolatry in the most daring manner, even after its entrance into Canaan. But the form in which this is done - &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, "still further in this" - is to be understood as intimating that the conduct of the fathers of the existing generation, and therefore not merely of those who grew up in the wilderness, but also of those who had lived in Canaan, has already been described in general terms in the preceding verses, and that what follows simply adds another novel feature. But this can only be the case if <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-23.htm">Ezekiel 20:23-26</a> are taken in the sense given above. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; is an accusative; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507; is construed with the accusative both of the person and thing. The more precise definition of &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; is not given in &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; ni nev at the end of the verse, but in the idolatry depicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28</a>. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; refers to the faithlessness involved in the breach of the covenant and in idolatry. This is the general description; whilst the idolatry mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28</a> constituted one particular feature, in which the faithlessness appeared in the form of blasphemy. For the fact itself, namely, the worship on high places, which was practised on every hand, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-24.htm">Ezekiel 16:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>.<p>In the enumeration of the offerings, there is something striking in the position in which &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1505; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1501; stands, namely, between the slaughtered sacrifices (&#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;) and the increase- and drink-offerings; and this is no doubt the reason why the clause '&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is omitted from the Cod. Vat. and Alex. of the lxx; and even Hitzig proposes to strike it out. But Theodoret found this reading in the Alex. Version; and Hitzig is wrong in affirming that &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1503; is used in connection with sacrifices, meat-offerings, and drink-offerings. The meat-offerings are not expressly named, for &#1512;&#1497;&#1492; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1495; does not signify meat-offerings, but is used in the law for the odour of all the offerings, both slaughtered sacrifices and meat-offerings, even though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-19.htm">Ezekiel 16:19</a> it is applied to the odour of the bloodless offerings alone. And in the same way does &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1503; embrace all the offerings, even the slain offerings, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-43.htm">Ezekiel 40:43</a>, in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, and other passages. That it is used in this general signification here, is evident from the introduction of the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1505;, irritation or provocation of their gifts, i.e., their gifts which provoked irritation on the part of God, because they were offered to idols. As this sentence applies to all the sacrifices (bloody and bloodless), so also does the clause which follows, '&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, refer to all the offerings which were burned upon the altar, without regard to the material employed. Consequently Ezekiel mentions only slain offerings and drink-offerings, and, by the two clauses inserted between, describes the offering of the slaughtered sacrifices as a gift of irritation to God, and of pleasant fragrance to the idolatrous worshippers who presented them. He does not mention the meat-offerings separately, because they generally formed an accompaniment to the slain offerings, and therefore were included in these. But although God had called the people to account for this worship on high places, they had not relinquished it even "to this day." This is no doubt the meaning of. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-29.htm">Ezekiel 20:29</a>, which has been interpreted in very different ways. The context shows, in the most conclusive manner, that &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is to be taken collectively, and that the use of the singular is to be explained from the antithesis to the one divinely appointed Holy Place in the temple, and not, as Kimchi and Hvernick suppose, from any allusion to one particular ba&#770;ma&#770;h of peculiar distinction, viz., "the great high place at Gibeon." The question &#1502;&#1492;  is not expressive of contempt (Hitzig), but "is founded upon the assumption that they would have to give an account of their doings; and merely asks, What kind of heights are those to which you are going? Who has directed you to go thither with your worship?" (Kliefoth). There is no need to refute the trivial fancy of J. D. Michaelis, which has been repeated by Hitzig, namely, that Ezekiel has taken &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; as a derivative from &#1489;&#1488; and &#1502;&#1492;. Again, the question does not presuppose a word addressed by God to Israel, which Ezekiel only has handed down to us; but is simply a rhetorical mode of presenting the condemnation by God of the worship of the high places, to which both the law and the earlier prophets had given utterance. The next clause, "and their name was called Height" (high place), is not to be regarded as containing merely a historical notice of the name given to these idolatrous places of worship; but the giving of the name is a proof of the continued existence of the thing; so that the words affirm, that notwithstanding the condemnation on the part of God, Israel had retained these high places, - had not abolished them to this day. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-31.htm">Ezekiel 20:31</a> facilitate the transition from the first part of this word of God to the second. What has already been said in vv. 5-29 concerning the idolatry of the people, from the time of its election onwards, is here expressly applied to the existing generation, and carries with it the declaration to them, that inasmuch as they are defiling themselves by idolatry, as their fathers did, Jehovah cannot permit Himself to be inquired of by them. The thought is couched in the form of a question, to express astonishment that those who denied the Lord, and dishonoured Him by their idolatry, should nevertheless imagine that they could obtain revelations from Him. The lifting up (&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;) of gifts signifies the offering of sacrifices upon the altars of the high places. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-31.htm">Ezekiel 20:31</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-3.htm">Ezekiel 20:3</a>. -  With this declaration God assigns the reason for the refusal to listen to idolaters, which had already been given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-3.htm">Ezekiel 20:3</a>. But it does not rest with this refusal. God now proceeds to disclose to them the thoughts of their own hearts, and announces to them that He will refine them by severe judgments, and bring them thereby to repentance of their sins, that He may then gather them out of the dispersion, and make them partakers of the promised salvation as a people willingly serving Him. - In this way do <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32-44</a> cast a prophetic glance over the whole of the future history of Israel. </body></html>
