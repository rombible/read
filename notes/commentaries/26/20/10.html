Under these were mystically comprehended the promises of a better life, wherein God will bestow upon his servants the peculiar marks of his favour, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm" title="You will show me the path of life: in your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand there are pleasures for ever more.">Psalm 16:11</a>. These promises were made to the Jews upon condition of their punctual obedience to the whole law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-5.htm" title="You shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-3.htm" title="If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;">Leviticus 26:3</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-26.htm" title="Cursed be he that confirms not all the words of this law to do them.

But if we understand the forementioned condition in its rigorous sense, as implying a perfectly exact and unsinning obedience; and as the word <span class="ital">life </span>contains the promise of eternal life under it; (a promise which the pious Jews expected, and hoped to obtain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/19-16.htm" title="And, behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?...">Matthew 19:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/26-6.htm" title="And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, to our fathers:...">Acts 26:6-7</a>;) as it was impossible to be performed, so no person could lay claim to eternal life by virtue of any promise therein contained; from whence St. Paul infers the necessity of seeking to Christ, and laying hold on the promises in the gospel, for the obtaining of justification and eternal life.” — Lowth. It must always be remembered, that the promises of spiritual blessings that we find in the Old Testament, such as pardon, acceptance with God, the Holy Spirit, sanctification, &c., belong to the gospel, or covenant of grace, as much as those in the New Testament: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-17.htm" title="Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:...">Hebrews 6:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-10.htm" title="For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:...">Hebrews 8:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm" title="These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.">Hebrews 11:13</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:10-26. The history of Israel in the wilderness is referred to in the new Testament as well as in the Old, for warning. God did great things for them. He gave them the law, and revived the ancient keeping of the sabbath day. Sabbaths are privileges; they are signs of our being his people. If we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to our comfort, it is the Lord that makes us holy, that is, truly happy, here; and prepares us to be happy, that is, perfectly holy, hereafter. The Israelites rebelled, and were left to the judgments they brought upon themselves. God sometimes makes sin to be its own punishment, yet he is not the Author of sin: there needs no more to make men miserable, than to give them up to their own evil desires and passions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The probation in the wilderness.

God's "name" means the sum-total of His perfections. To manifest these, His gratuitous mercy abounding above their sins, yet without wrong to His justice, and so to set forth His glory, was and is the ultimate end of His dealings (Eze 20:14, 22; 2Sa 7:23; Isa 63:12; Ro 9:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wherefore, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">And</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I caused them to go forth</span>; removed all obstacles, furnished them with all necessaries, went before them, and showed them the way they should go, as is expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:">Exodus 13:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And brought them; </span> I brought; it was not Moses’s error, though Pharaoh thought so, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-3.htm" title="For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness has shut them in.">Exodus 14:3</a>,4</span>, but the peculiar conduct of God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall you encamp by the sea.">Exodus 14:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Into the wilderness; </span> a barren, sandy part of the country, the borders of Egypt towards the Red Sea; yet having mountains which shut them in on both sides, and frontier garrisons near them: and as he brought them in, so he conducted them out of these straits, though here it is not mentioned. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,....

Thy mother was like a vine, planted by the water in thy repose; it became a fruitful and rich in tendrils from many waters. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11</a>. And it had strong shoots for rulers' sceptres; and its growth ascended among the clouds, and was visible in its height in the multitude of its branches. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>. Then it was torn up in fury, cast to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit; its strong shoots were broken off, and withered; fire devoured them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-13.htm">Ezekiel 19:13</a>. And now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>. There goeth out fire from the shoot of its branches, devoureth its fruit, so that there is no more a strong shoot upon it, a sceptre for ruling. - A lamentation it is, and it will be for lamentation. - From the lamentable fate of the princes transported to Egypt and Babylon, the ode passes to a description of the fate, which the lion-like rapacity of the princes is preparing for the kingdom and people. Israel resembled a vine planted by the water. The difficult word &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1498; we agree with Hvernick and Kliefoth in tracing to the verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, to rest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>), and regard it as synonymous with &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a> : "in thy repose," i.e., in the time of peaceful, undisturbed prosperity. For neither of the other renderings, "in thy blood" and "in thy likeness," yields a suitable meaning. The latter explanation, which originated with Raschi and Kimchi, is precluded by the fact that Ezekiel always uses the word &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; to express the idea of resemblance. - For the figure of the vine, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>. This vine sent out strong shoots for rulers' sceptres; that is to say, it brought forth powerful kings, and grew up to a great height, even into the clouds. &#1506;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; signifies "cloud," lit., thicket of clouds, not only here, but in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-10.htm">Ezekiel 31:10</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-14.htm">Ezekiel 31:14</a>. The rendering "branches" or "thicket of foliage" is not suitable in any of these passages. The form of the word is not to be taken as that of a new plural of &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, the plural of &#1506;&#1489;, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>; but is the plural of &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, an interlacing or thicket of foliage, and is simply transferred to the interlacing or piling up of the clouds. The clause '&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, and it appeared, was seen, or became visible, simply serves to depict still further the glorious and vigorous growth, and needs no such alteration as Hitzig proposes. This picture is followed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>., without any particle of transition, by a description of the destruction of this vine. It was torn up in fury by the wrath of God, cast down to the ground, so that its fruit withered (compare the similar figures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-10.htm">Ezekiel 17:10</a>). &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; is used collectively, as equivalent to &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11</a>); and the suffix in &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is written in the singular on account of this collective use of &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;. The uprooting ends in the transplanting of the vine into a waste, dry, unwatered land, - in other words, in the transplanting of the people, Israel, into exile. The dry land is Babylon, so described as being a barren soil in which the kingdom of God could not flourish. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>, this catastrophe is occasioned by the princes. The fire, which devours the fruit of the vine so that it cannot send out any more branches, emanates &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;, from the shoot of its branches, i.e., from its branches, which are so prolific in shoots. &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; is the shoot which grew into rulers' sceptres, i.e., the royal family of the nation. The reference is to Zedekiah, whose treacherous breach of covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>) led to the overthrow of the kingdom and of the earthly monarchy. The picture from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a> onwards is prophetic. The tearing up of the vine, and its transplantation into a dry land, had already commenced with the carrying away of Jeconiah; but it was not completed till the destruction of Jerusalem and the carrying away of Zedekiah, which were still in the future at the time when these words were uttered. - The clause '&#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;  does not contain a concluding historical notice, as H&#1492;vernick supposes, but simply the finale of the lamentation, indicating the credibility of the prediction which it contains. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497; is prophetic, like the perfects from &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a> onwards; and the meaning is this: A lamentation forms the substance of the whole chapter; and it will lead to lamentation, when it is fulfilled. </body></html>
