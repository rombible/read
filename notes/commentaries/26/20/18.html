At the same time, it would be a mistake to confine what he says exclusively to that generation. In this, as in the other parts of the discourse, he regards Israel as a whole, and while speaking of one period of their history especially, yet treats of national characteristics which may have come to their most marked development only at a later time. This generation was very earnestly warned against the sins of their fathers, and exhorted to obedience to the Divine law. The whole Book of Deuteronomy is the comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/20-18.htm" title="But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:">Ezekiel 20:18-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/20-18.htm" title="But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:...">Ezekiel 20:18-24</a>. </span><span class="ital">But I said unto their children in the wilderness — </span>In the plains of Moab; <span class="ital">Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers — </span>Imitate not their superstitious usages, nor retain their foolish and wicked customs, but walk in the statutes of your God.

The history of Israel in the wilderness is referred to in the new Testament as well as in the Old, for warning. God did great things for them. He gave them the law, and revived the ancient keeping of the sabbath day. Sabbaths are privileges; they are signs of our being his people. If we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to our comfort, it is the Lord that makes us holy, that is, truly happy, here; and prepares us to be happy, that is, perfectly holy, hereafter. The Israelites rebelled, and were left to the judgments they brought upon themselves. God sometimes makes sin to be its own punishment, yet he is not the Author of sin: there needs no more to make men miserable, than to give them up to their own evil desires and passions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The book of Deuteronomy contains the address to "the children" of those who perished in the wilderness.

With &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; the construction with the infinitive passes over into the finite verb. Lifting the hand, sc. to heaven, is a gesture employed in taking an oath (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>). The substance of the oath is introduced by the word &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; at the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5</a>; but the clause '&#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; (and made myself known) is previously inserted, and then the lifting of the hand mentioned again to indicate the importance of this act of divine grace.

Both &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; (I lifted my hand) and &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>. The word &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to seek out, explore, also belongs to the Pentateuch (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-33.htm">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>); and the same may be said of the description given of Canaan as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, etc.). But &#1510;&#1489;&#1497;, ornament, as an epithet applied to the land of Israel, is first employed by the prophets of the time of the captivity - namely, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-15.htm">Ezekiel 20:15</a> of this chapter, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-16.htm">Daniel 11:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-41.htm">Daniel 11:41</a>. The election of the Israelites to be the people of Jehovah, contained eo ipso the command to give up the idols of Egypt, although it was at Sinai that the worship of other gods was for the first time expressly prohibited (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>), and Egyptian idolatry is only mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>). Ezekiel calls the idols "abominations of their eyes," because, "although they were abominable and execrable things, they were looked upon with delight by them" (Rosenmller). It is true that there is nothing expressly stated in the Pentateuch as to the refusal of the Israelites to obey the command of God, or their unwillingness to give up idolatry in Egypt; but it may be inferred from the statements contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-9.htm">Exodus 6:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12</a>, to the effect that the Israelites did not hearken to Moses when he communicated to them the determination of God to lead them out of Egypt, and still more plainly from their relapse into Egyptian idolatry, from the worship of the golden calf at Sinai (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>), and from their repeated desire to return to Egypt while wandering in the desert.<p>(Note: The remarks of Calvin upon this point are very good. "We do not learn directly from Moses," he says, "that they had been rebels against God, because they would not throw away their idols and superstitions; but the conjecture is a very probable one, that they had always been so firmly fixed in their abominations as to prevent in a certain way the hand of God from bringing them relief. And assuredly, if they had embraced what Moses promised them in the name of God with promptness of mind, the execution of the promise would have been more prompt and swift. But we may learn that it was their own obtuseness which hindered God from stretching out His hand forthwith and actually fulfilling all that He had promised. It was necessary, indeed, that God should contend with Pharaoh, that His power might be more conspicuously displayed; but the people would not have been so tyrannically afflicted if they had not closed the door of divine mercy.")<p>Nor is there anything said in the Pentateuch concerning the determination of God to pour out His wrath upon the idolatrous people in Egypt. We need not indeed assume on this account that Ezekiel derived his information from some special traditional source, as Vitringa has done ObservV. ss. I. 263), or regard the statement as a revelation made by God to Ezekiel, and through him to us. The words do not disclose to us either a particular fact or a definite decree of God; they simply contain a description of the attitude which God, from His inmost nature, assumes towards sinners who rebel against His holy commandments, and which He displayed both in the declaration made concerning Himself as a zealous, or jealous God, who visits iniquities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), and also in the words addressed to Moses when the people fell into idolatry at Sinai, "Let me alone, that my wrath may wax not against them, and that I may consume them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). All that God expresses here, His heart must have felt in Egypt towards the people who would not desist from idolatry. For the words themselves, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-8.htm">Ezekiel 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a>), "but I did it for my name's sake." The missing object explaining what He did, namely, abstain from pouring out His wrath, is to be gathered from what follows: "that I might not profane my name." This would have taken place if God had destroyed Israel by pouring out His wrath; in other words, have allowed them to be destroyed by the Egyptians. The heathen might then have said that Jehovah had been unable to liberate His people from their hand and power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>). &#1492;&#1495;&#1500; is an infin. Niphal of &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; for &#1492;&#1495;&#1500; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-4.htm">Leviticus 21:4</a>). </body></html>
