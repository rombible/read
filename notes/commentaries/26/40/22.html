When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The gates both of the outer and of the inner court.

The different approaches corresponded in plan. In the case of these two other gates, however, no mention is made of a building with thirty chambers such as was found on the east side. Only one was needed, and it was assigned to the east as being the sacred quarter, and that most conveniently situated for the officiating priests.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-16.htm" title="And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and on each post were palm trees.">Ezekiel 40:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By seven steps:</span> it is not said what number of stairs they went up to the east gate, but by this if appears they were seven steps in number, and it is said by some the form was semi-circular. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The arches thereof, </span> of this portico, the curious vaulted roof. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before them; </span> within, or more inward than the steps or gate. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looked towards the east,.... <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-14.htm">Ezekiel 40:14</a>, signifying that the light of the churches, their privileges, and flourishing condition, will be alike everywhere, as in one part of the world, so in another; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>, <p>and they went up unto it by seven steps; or stairs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>, the number of them is not there mentioned as here, but the same in both; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>, <p>and the arches thereof were before them; the steps; or "within" them, as the Septuagint; the steps led to the arches of the gate, or to the porch of it, which were more inward. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/40.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>.
