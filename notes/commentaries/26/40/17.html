The divine and glorious Person in human form, having brought the prophet up to the eastern gate, and through it, and the porch that belonged to it, to the inner gate of it, which lay westward; and having measured that gate, its threshold, the porch, the posts or pillars, and little chambers in it; introduced him into a spacious piece of ground, that lay open to the air, and surrounded the whole building; and answers to the court of the Israelites in the temple, where they worshipped promiscuously, good and bad: and so may design the outward visible state of the Gospel church, consisting of good and bad, of wise and foolish virgins; like a field that has both wheat and tares in it; or a corn floor that has wheat and chaff upon it; which in the latter day will grow worse and worse, and be given to the Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a> but shall be recovered again, and make a considerable part of this fabric; which represents the state of the church, and the outward administration of the word and ordinances in it, and the visible fellowship of the saints together in them. <p>And, lo, there were chambers; in the outward court, in various parts of it; which signify, as before, visible congregated churches, formed according to the order of the Gospel; in which the word is preached, ordinances administered, and saints have fellowship one with another. It is a different word here used from that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-7.htm">Ezekiel 40:7</a>, and is by some rendered "cells, storehouses, treasuries" (f); and here, the unsearchable riches of Christ are preached, and the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid in him are brought forth, and presented to the view of the saints. <p>And a pavement made for the court round about; as this court went round about the whole building, so there was a pavement upon it all around. The word (g) used has the signification of a "burning coal". Probably this pavement appeared as made of stones of various colours, of black, white, and red, like a chequered work of black and white marble; or as made of the porphyry stone, which is variegated with divers colours. This pavement was for those that dwelt in the chambers to walk in, and converse together: and it may denote the walk of the saints, both in the ordinances of the Gospel, and in their outward conversation, as becoming it; in love to them that are within, and in wisdom towards those that are without: and this is walking as on a pavement, on firm ground, in a plain and even way, where there is no occasion of stumbling; it is walking clean, in righteousness and holiness, and not in the mire and dirt of sin; and it is pleasant walking in the courts of the Lord, and in the ways and paths of wisdom; and beautiful it is to see the saints walk harmoniously and comfortably together here, conversing with each other, and building up one another upon their most holy faith. <p>Thirty chambers were upon a pavement; according to some, fifteen on each side of the eastern gate, as you came out of it into the court; or rather, according to Cocceius's tables, these were all around the court, eight to the east, eight to the north, eight to the south, and six to the west; or, as Villalpandus, seven to the east and west each, and eight to the north and south apiece. This suggests that there will be visible congregated churches in the latter day in all parts of the world, east, west, north, and south; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5</a>. <p>(f) "cellae", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Polanus, Cocceius, Starckius;  Sept; "gazophylacia", V.

Emerging from the doorway inwards, the prophet, accompanied by his celestial guide, stepped into the outward court, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the area surrounding the temple buildings. There the first thing observed was that <span class="cmt_word">chambers and a pavement</span> ran round the court. The chambers were cells, or rooms - <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> always signifying single rooms in a building (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>) - whose dimensions, exact sites, and uses are not specified, though, as they were thirty in number, it is probable they were arranged on the east, north, and south sides of the court, five upon each side of the gate, and standing somewhat apart from each other; that they were large enough to contain as many as thirty persons (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-22.htm">1 Samuel 9:22</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2</a>); and that they were designed for sacrificial meals and such-like purposes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, etc.). In pre-exilic times such halls had been occupied by distinguished person s connected with the temple service (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-8.htm">Ezekiel 8:8-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>, etc.; Jeremiah 36:10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>). The pavement was a tessellated floor (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>), which ran round the court and was named <span class="cmt_word">the lower pavement</span>, to distinguish it from that laid in the inner court which stood at a higher elevation than the outer. As another note of position, it is stated to have been by the side (literally, <span class="accented">shoulder</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the gates over against</span>  - or, <span class="accented">answerable to</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">the length of the gates</span>. This can only mean that the breadth of the pavement was fifty cubits (the length of the gates, ver. 15) less six cubits (the thickness of the wall, ver. 5), or forty-four cubits, and that it ran along the inner length of the wall on either side of the gates. The breadth of the court <span class="cmt_word">from the forefront of the lower gate</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the inner end of the east gate or the edge of the pavement, <span class="cmt_word">unto the forefront of the inner court</span> <span class="cmt_word">without was an hundred cubits</span>. Whether the measurement was up to the wall of the inner court, within which, on this hypothesis, its gate must have wholly lain, or only up to the door of the inner court, which, on this understanding, must have projected beyond its wall, is obscure. The first interpretation derives support from the circumstance that the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of the measurement is said to have been, not the inner gate, but the inner court; while the second finds countenance in the use of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span>, which seems to indicate that the measuring proceeded from the western extremity of the outer gate to the eastern extremity of the inner gate, and appears to be confirmed by vers. 23 and 27, as well as by the consideration that in this way the symmetry of the building would be better preserved than by making the outer gate project into the court and the inner gate lie wholly within the inner wall. In this way the hundred cubits marked the distance between the extremities of the gates, the whole breadth of the court being two hundred cubits, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a hundred cubits between the gates, with two gates' lengths of fifty cubits each added. The same measurements applied to the north gate, which the seer next approached. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reunion of Israel as One Nation under the Future King David<p>This word of God directs the prophet to represent by a sign the reunion of the tribes of Israel, which have been divided into two kingdoms (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15-17</a>), and to explain this sign to the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-18.htm">Ezekiel 37:18-21</a>), and predict its sanctification and blessedness under the reign of the future David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22-28</a>).

But the act itself is a different one here, and neither the passage referred to nor <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-15.htm">Ezekiel 21:15</a> furnishes any proof that &#1506;&#1509; signifies a staff or rod. Ezekiel would undoubtedly have used &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; for a staff. Nor have we even to think of flat boards, but simply of pieces of wood upon which a few words could be written, and which could be held in one hand. The &#1500; before the names to be written upon each piece of wood is the sign of the genitive, indicating to whom it belongs, as in the case of the heading to David's psalms (&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;). This is evident from the fact that in &#1488;&#1509; &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the construct state is used instead. The name is to indicate that the piece of wood belongs to Judah or Ephraim, and represents it. The command to Ezekiel to write upon one piece of wood, not only Judah, but "the sons of Israel, his associates," arose from the circumstance that the kingdom of Judah included, in addition to the tribe of Judah, the greater portion of Benjamin and Simeon, the tribe of Levi and those pious Israelites who emigrated at different times from the kingdom of the ten tribes into that of Judah, who either were or became associates of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-12.htm">2 Chronicles 11:12</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-18.htm">2 Chronicles 30:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). In the writing upon the second piece of wood, &#1488;&#1509; &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is an explanatory apposition to &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507;, and an accusative governed by &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;. But the command is not to be understood as signifying that Ezekiel was to write the words &#1506;&#1509; &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; upon the piece of wood; all that he was to write was, "Joseph and the whole house of Israel, his associates." The name of Joseph is chosen, in all probability, not as the more honourable name, as Hvernick supposes, but because the house of Joseph, consisting of the two powerful tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, formed the trunk of the kingdom of the ten tribes (Kliefoth). The "whole house of Israel, his associates," are the rest of the tribes belonging to that kingdom. The two pieces of wood, with these inscriptions upon them, Ezekiel is to put together, and hold in his hand bound together in one. &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, what these (two pieces of wood) are to thee, is equivalent to, what thou meanest to indicate by them. For the rest, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-19.htm">Ezekiel 24:19</a>. In the word of God explaining the action (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-19.htm">Ezekiel 37:19</a>), the wood of Joseph is not the piece of wood with Joseph's name written upon it, but the kingdom represented by this piece of wood which was in Ephraim's hand, inasmuch as the hegemony was with the tribe of Ephraim. Instead of the wood, therefore, the tribes (not staffs) of Israel, i.e., the Israelites who constituted these tribes, are mentioned as his associates. God will put these upon the wood of Joseph (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;), i.e., will join them together, and then place them with the wood of Judah, i.e., the kingdom of Judah, and unite them into one wood (or nation).  &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1509; , the construction of which has been misunderstood by Hitzig, is neither in apposition to &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, nor governed by &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;: "and will put them thereupon, upon the wood of Judah" (Hitzig and Kliefoth), or, "I add them to it, (namely) with the wood of Judah" (De Wette); but it is dependent upon &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;, "I take the wood of Joseph...and the tribes of Israel, his associates, which I put thereon, along with the wood of Judah, and make them into one wood." The construction is rendered obscure simply by the fact that the relative clause, "which I put thereon," is attached to the principal clause '&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; by Vav consec. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, "they shall be one in my hand," there is probably an antithesis to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, those who have come into Ephraim's hand, the tribes severed by Ephraim from the kingdom of God, will God once more bring together with Judah, and hold in His hand as an undivided nation. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-20.htm">Ezekiel 37:20</a> the description of the sign is completed by the additional statement, that the pieces of wood on which the prophet has written are to be in his hand before their eyes, and consequently that the prophet is to perform the act in such a way that his countrymen may see it; from which it follows that he performed it in its outward reality. The fulfilment of the instructions is not specially mentioned, as being self-evident; but in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-28</a> the further explanation of the symbolical action is given at once; and the interpretation goes beyond the symbol, inasmuch as it not only describes the manner in which God will effect the union of the divided tribes, but also what He will do for the preservation of the unity of the reunited people, and for the promotion of their blessedness. This explanation is arranged in two strophes through the repetition of the concluding thought: "they will be my people," etc., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a>. Each of these strophes contains a twofold promise.<p>The first (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-23</a>) promises (a) the gathering of the Israelites out of their dispersion, their restoration to their own land, and their union as one nation under the rule of David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22</a>); (b) their purification from all sins, and sanctification as the true people of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23</a>). The second strophe (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24-27</a>) promises (a) their undisturbed eternal abode in the land, under David their prince (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>); (b) the blessedness conferred upon them through the conclusion of an everlasting covenant of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a>). This second promise, therefore, constitutes the completion of the first, securing to the nation of Israel its restoration and sanctification for all time. The whole promise, however, is merely a repetition of that contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-31</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-30</a>. - The three factors - the gathering out of the nations, restoration to the land of Israel, and reunion as one people - form the first act of divine grace. The union of the Israelites, when brought back to their land, is accomplished by God giving them in David a king who will so rule the reunited people that they will not be divided any more into two peoples and two kingdoms. The Chetib &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is not to be altered into the plural &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, as in the Keri; but &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; is to be supplied in thought, from the preceding clause, as the subject to the verb. The division of the nation into two kingdoms had its roots, no doubt, in the ancient jealousy existing between the two tribes Ephraim and Judah; but it was primarily brought to pass through the falling away of Solomon from the Lord. Consequently it could only be completely and for ever terminated through the righteous government of the second David, and the purification of the people from their sins. This is the way in which <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a> is attached to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22</a>. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a> compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-11.htm">Ezekiel 14:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>. Different interpretations have been given of the words, "I help them from all their dwelling-places, in which they have sinned." They recall to mind <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm">Ezekiel 36:29</a>, "I help them from all their uncleannesses." As &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1502;&#1503; signifies, in that case, "to preserve therefrom," so in the present instance the thought can only be, "God will preserve them from all the dwelling-places in which they have sinned." Hengstenberg is of opinion that the redemption from the dwelling-places does not take place locally, but spiritually, through the cleansing away of all traces of sin, first from the hearts, and then, in consequence, from all around. In this way is the land changed, through the power of the Lord, into another land, from a sinful to a holy one; just as before it had been changed from a holy to a sinful one through the guilt of the people. But if this were the only thought which the words contained, Ezekiel would certainly have placed the &#1493;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; before '&#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. As the words read, the deliverance of the people from their sinful dwelling-places is to precede their purification, to prepare the way for it and bring it to pass, and not to follow after it. The dwelling-places, at or in which they have sinned, cannot be the settlements in foreign lands, as Hitzig supposes, but only the dwelling-places in Canaan, to which the Lord would bring them after gathering them from their dispersion. &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; does not signify, "leading out from these dwelling-places," which is the explanation given by Kliefoth, who consequently thinks that we must understand the words as denoting the leading over of Israel from the present Canaan, or the Canaan of this life, to which its sins adhere, to the glorified, new, and eternal Canaan. This view is utterly irreconcilable both with the words themselves and also with the context. Even if &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; meant to lead out, it would not be allowable to transform the "leading out" from the sinful Canaan into a "leading in" to the glorified and heavenly Canaan. Moreover, the further development of this promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a> also shows that it is not in the glorified, eternal Canaan that Israel is to dwell, but in the earthly Canaan in which its fathers dwelt. It is obvious from this, that in all the promise here given there is no allusion to a transformation and glorification of Canaan itself. The helping or saving from all dwelling-places in which they have sinned would rather consist in the fact, therefore, that God would remove from their dwelling-places everything that could offer them an inducement to sin. For although sin has its seat, not in the things without us, but in the heart, the external circumstances of a man do offer various inducements to sin. Before the captivity, Canaan offered such an inducement to the Israelites through the idolatry and moral corruption of the Canaanites who were left in the land. And with reference to this the Lord promises that in future, when His people are brought back to Canaan, He will preserve them from the sinful influence of their dwelling-places. But this preservation will only be effected with complete success when God purifies Israel itself, and, by means of its renovation, eradicates all sinful desire from the heart (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>). In this way &#1493;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is appended in the most fitting way to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; . - Through the removal of all sinful influences from around them, and the purifying of the heart, Israel will then become in truth the people of God, and Jehovah the God of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23</a>).<p>Israel, when thus renewed, will walk in the rights of the Lord and fulfil His commandments, under the protection of its one shepherd David, i.e., of the Messiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>); and its children and children's children will dwell for ever in its own land, David being its prince for ever (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-28.htm">Ezekiel 36:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-24.htm">Ezekiel 34:24</a>). What is new in this promise, which is repeated from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a> and 36, is contained in &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, which is to be taken in the strict sense of the word. Neither the dwelling of Israel in Canaan, nor the government of the David-Messiah, will ever have an end. &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is therefore repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a> in the promise of the covenant which the Lord will make with His people. The thought itself has already been expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is to be understood, both here and there, as comprehending all the saving good which the Lord will bestow upon all His sanctified people. There are only two factors of this salvation mentioned here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a>, namely, the multiplication of the people, as the earthly side of the divine blessing, and the establishing of His eternal sanctuary in the midst of them as the spiritual side. These two points refer back to the former acts of God, and hold up to view the certain and full realization in the future of what has hitherto been neither perfectly nor permanently accomplished on account of the sins of the people. &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a>, is not to be taken in connection with &#1493;&#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, so as to form one idea in the sense of dabo eos multiplicatos (Venema and Hengstenberg), for we have no analogies of such a mode of combination; but &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, I make, or place them, is to be taken by itself, and completed from the context, "I make them into a nation, and I multiply them (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-10.htm">Ezekiel 36:10-11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-37.htm">Ezekiel 36:37</a>). Ezekiel has here <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-9.htm">Leviticus 26:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11</a> in his mind, as we may see from the fact that the words, "I give my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever," are obviously formed after <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11</a>, "I give my dwelling in the midst of them;" in such a manner, however, that by the substitution of &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and the addition of &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, the promise is both deepened and strengthened. In the change of &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; into &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, he may indeed have had the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a> floating before his mind, "they shall make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them;" nevertheless he deliberately selected the expression "my sanctuary," to indicate that the Lord would dwell in the midst of Israel as the Holy One, and the Sanctifier of His people. Moreover, the words are not, "my dwelling will be in the midst of them, or among them" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1501;), but &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, over them. This expression is transferred from the site of the temple, towering above the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>), to the dwelling of God among His people, to give prominence to the protective power and saving grace of the God who rules in Israel (cf. Hengstenberg on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>). The sanctuary which Jehovah will give in Israel for ever, i.e., will found and cause to endure, that He may dwelling the midst of it to shelter and bless, is the temple, but not the temple built by Zerubbabel. As an objection to this Jewish interpretation, Jerome has justly said: "but how could it be said to stand 'for ever,' when that temple which was built in the time of Zerubbabel, and afterwards restored by many others, was consumed by Roman fire? All these things are to be taken as referring to the church in the time of the Saviour, when His tabernacle was placed in the church." There is no reference whatever here to the rebuilding of the temple by Zerubbabel; not because that temple did not stand for ever and was destroyed by the Romans, but chiefly because God did not make it His abode, or fill this temple with His gracious presence (Shechinah). The sanctuary which God will place for ever among His people is the sanctuary seen by Ezekiel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>ff.; and this is merely a figurative representation of the "dwelling of God in the midst of His people through His Son and Holy Spirit" (cf. Vitringa, Observv. I. p. 161), which began to be realized in the incarnation of the Logos, who is set forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> as the true &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, in the words &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, and is continued in the spiritual dwelling of God in the heart of believers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>), and will be completed at the second coming of our Lord in the "tabernacle (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;) of God with men" of the new Jerusalem, of which the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple, since Israel will then first have become in truth the people of God, and Jehovah (God with them) their God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>). - The promise concludes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-28.htm">Ezekiel 37:28</a> with an allusion to the impression which these acts of God in Israel will make upon the heathen (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-36.htm">Ezekiel 36:36</a>). From the fact that Jehovah erects His sanctuary in the midst of Israel for ever, they will learn that it is He who sanctifieth Israel. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to sanctify, means, "to remove from all connection either with sin or with its consequences. Here the reference is to the latter, because these alone strike the eyes of the heathen; but the former is presupposed as the necessary foundation" (Hengstenberg). The words rest upon the promises of the Pentateuch, where God describes Himself as He who will and does sanctify Israel (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-31.htm">Leviticus 22:31-33</a>). This promise, which has hitherto been only imperfectly fulfilled on account of Israel's guilt, will be perfectly realized in the future, when Israel will walk in the ways of the Lord, renewed by the Spirit of God.<p>Thus does this prophecy of Ezekiel span the whole future of the people of God even to eternity. But the promise in which it culminates, namely, that the Lord will erect His sanctuary in the midst of His restored people, and there take up His abode above them for ever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a>.), is of importance as helping to decide the question, how we are to understand the fulfilment of the restoration to Canaan into the land given to the fathers, which is promised to all Israel; whether, in a literal manner, by the restoration of the Israelites to Palestine; or spiritually, by the gathering together of the Israelites converted to the Lord their God and Saviour, and their introduction into the kingdom of God founded by Christ, in which case Canaan, as the site of the Old Testament kingdom of God, would be a symbolical or typical designation of the earthly soil of the heavenly kingdom, which has appeared in the Christian church. - These two different views have stood opposed to one another from time immemorial, inasmuch as the Jews expect from the Messiah, for whose advent they still hope, not only their restoration to Palestine, but the erection of the kingdom of David and the rebuilding of the temple upon Mount Zion, together with the sacrificial worship of the Levitical law; whereas in the Christian church, on the ground of the New Testament doctrine, that the old covenant has been abolished along with the Levitical temple-worship through the perfect fulfilment of the law by Christ and the perpetual efficacy of His atoning sacrifice, the view has prevailed that, with the abolition of the Old Testament form of the kingdom of God, even Palestine has ceased to be the chosen land of the revelation of the saving grace of God, and under the new covenant Canaan extends as far as the Israel of the new covenant, the church of Jesus Christ, is spread abroad over the earth, and that Zion or Jerusalem is to be sought wherever Christendom worships God in spirit and in truth, wherever Christ is with His people, and dwells in the hearts of believers through the Holy Spirit. It was by J. A. Bengel and C. F. Oetinger that the so-called "realistic" interpretation of the Messianic prophecies of the Old Testament - according to which, after the future conversion to Christ of the Jewish people who are hardened still, the establishment of the kingdom of God in Palestine and its capital Jerusalem is to be expected - has been revived and made into one of the leading articles of Christian hope. By means of this "realistic" exposition of the prophetic word the chiliastic dogma of the establishment of a kingdom of glory before the last judgment and the end of the world is then deduced from the twentieth chapter of the Apocalypse; and many of the theologians of our day regard this as the certain resultant of a deeper study of the Scriptures. In the more precise definition of the dogma itself, the several supporters diverge very widely from one another; but they all agree in this, that they base the doctrine chiefly upon the prophetic announcement of the eventual conversion and glorification of all Israel. - As Ezekiel then stands out among all the prophets as the one who gives the most elaborate prediction of the restoration of Israel under the government of the Messiah, and he not only draws in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> a detailed picture of the new form of the kingdom of God, but also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a> and 39, in the prophecy concerning Gog and Magog, foretells an attack on the part of the heathen world upon the restored kingdom of God, which appears, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7-9</a>, to constitute the close of the thousand years' reign; we must look somewhat more closely at this view, and by examining the arguments pro and con, endeavour to decide the question as to the fulfilment of the Old Testament prophecies concerning the future of Israel. In doing this, however, we shall fix our attention exclusively upon the exegetical arguments adduced in support of the chiliastic view by its latest supporters.<p>(Note: These are, C. A.
