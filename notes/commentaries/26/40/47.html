When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The court - The inner court (B) where was the brass altar <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>.<p>The new chapter would begin better at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47. court, an hundred cubits &#8230; foursquare&#8212;not to be confounded with the inner court, or court of Israel, which was open to all who had sacrifices to bring, and went round the three sides of the sacred territory, one hundred cubits broad. This court was one hundred cubits square, and had the altar in it, in front of the temple. It was the court of the priests, and hence is connected with those who had charge of the altar and the music.

This was typical of Christ, the altar, we Christians have a right to eat of; which sanctifies every gift offered upon it, and which every worshipper should by faith look unto for the expiation of their sins.

The distance from north to south of the inner court being a hundred cubits, if to these be added twice two hundred cubits, the space between the outer court wall and that of the inner court, the result will give five hundred cubits as the breadth of the outer court, from north gate to south gate. Then as the length of the inner court was a hundred cubits, if to these be added first the hundred cubits lying before the inner court towards the east, secondly, the hundred cubits covered by the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13, 14</a>), and thirdly, the one hundred cubits which extended behind the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13, 14</a>), the total will amount to five hundred cubits for the length of the outer court from east to west. The outer court, therefore, like the inner, was a square. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Introduction<p>Preparation of Gog and his army for the invasion of the restored land of Israel. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-1.htm">Ezekiel 38:1</a>.

And will mislead thee, and will put rings in thy jaws, and lead thee out, and all thine army, horses, and riders, all clothed in perfect beauty, a great assembly, with buckler and shield, all wielding swords; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>.

After many days shalt thou be visited, at the end of the years shalt thou come into the land, which is brought back from the sword, gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which were constantly laid waste, but now it is brought out of the nations, and they dwell together in safety; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-9.htm">Ezekiel 38:9</a>.

Command to prophesy against God. &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490;, Gog, the name of the prince against whom the prophecy is directed, is probably a name which Ezekiel has arbitrarily formed from the name of the country, Magog; although Gog does occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-4.htm">1 Chronicles 5:4</a> as the name of a Reubenite, of whom nothing further is known. The construction &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1490;, Gog of the land of Magog, is an abbreviated expression for "Gog from the land of Magog;" and '&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1490; is not to be taken in connection with &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, as the local object ("toward Gog, to the land of Magog"), as Ewald and Hvernick would render it; since it would be very difficult in that case to explain the fact that &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490; is afterwards resumed in the apposition '&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;.<p>&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1490;, Magog, is the name of a people mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> as descended from Japhet, according to the early Jewish and traditional explanation, the great Scythian people; and here also it is the name of a people, and is written with the article (&#1492;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1490;), to mark the people as one well known from the time of Genesis, and therefore properly the land of the Magog (-people). Gog is still further described as the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. It is true that Ewald follows Aquila, the Targum, and Jerome, and connects &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; with &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; as an appellative in the sense of princeps capitis, chief prince. But the argument used in support of this explanation, namely, that there is no people of the name of Rosh mentioned either in the Old Testament or by Josephus, is a very weak one; whilst, on the other hand, the appellative rendering, though possible, no doubt, after the analogy of &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>, is by no means probable, for the simple reason that the &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-3.htm">Ezekiel 38:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1</a>, and in such repetitions circumstantial titles are generally abbreviated. The Byzantine and Arabic writers frequently mention a people called  &#788;&#x3a1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, Arab. Ru equals s, dwelling in the country of the Taurus, and reckoned among the Scythian tribes (for the passages, see Ges. Thesaurus, p. 1253), so that there is no reason to question the existence of a people known by the name of Rosh; even though the attempt of Bochart to find a trace of such a people in the  &#788;&#x3a1;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (Ptol. iii. 5) and Roxalani (Plin. h. n. iv. 12), by explaining this name as formed from a combination of Rhos (Rhox) and Alani, is just as doubtful as the conjecture, founded upon the investigations of Frhn (Ibn Foszlan, u. a. Araber Berichte ber die Russen lterer Zeit, St. Petersburg 1823), that the name of the Russians is connected with this  &#788;&#x3a1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, Arab. ru equals s, and our &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;. Meshech and Tubal (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a>), the Moschi and Tibareni of classical writers (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>), dwelt, according to the passage before us, in the neighbourhood of Magog. There were also found in the army of Gog, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>, Pharas (Persians), Cush, and Phut (Ethiopians and Libyans, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>), and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>, Gomer and the house of Togarmah. From a comparison of this list with <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>, Kliefoth draws the conclusion that Ezekiel omits all the peoples mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> as belonging to the family of Japhet, who had come into historical notice in his time, or have done so since, namely, the Medes, Greeks, and Thracians; whilst, on the other hand, he mentions all the peoples enumerated, who have never yet appeared upon the stage of history. But this remark is out of place, for the simple reason that Ezekiel also omits the Japhetic tribes of Ashkenaz and Riphath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-3.htm">Genesis 10:3</a>), and still more from the fact that he notices not only the &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, or Persians, who were probably related to the &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;, but also the Hamitic peoples Cush and Phut, two African families. Consequently the army of Gog consisted not only of wild Japhetic tribes, who had not yet attained historical importance, but of Hamitic tribes also, that is to say, of peoples living at the extreme north (&#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>) and east (Persians) and south (Ethiopians), i.e., on the borders of the then known world. These are all summoned by Gog, and gathered together for an attack upon the people of God. This points to a time when their former foes, Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistines, and Syrians, and the old imperial powers, Egypt, Asshur, Babel, Javan, will all have passed away from the stage of history, and the people of God will stand in the centre of the historical life of the world, and will have spread so widely over the earth, that its foes will only be found on the borders of the civilised world (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-3.htm">Ezekiel 38:3-9</a> contain in general terms the determinate counsel of God concerning Gog. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-3.htm">Ezekiel 38:3-6</a>. Jehovah is about to mislead Gog to a crusade against His people Israel, and summons him to prepare for the invasion of the restored land of Israel. The announcement of the purpose for which Jehovah will make use of Gog and his army, and the summons addressed to him to make ready, form two strophes, which are clearly marked by the similarity of the conclusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-9.htm">Ezekiel 38:9</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-3.htm">Ezekiel 38:3</a>. God will deal with Gog, to sanctify Himself upon him by means of judgment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-10.htm">Ezekiel 38:10</a>). He therefore misleads him to an attack upon the people of Israel. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;, an intensive form from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, may signify, as vox media, to cause to return (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-27.htm">Ezekiel 39:27</a>), and to cause to turn away, to lead away from the right road or goal, to lead astray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-10.htm">Isaiah 47:10</a>). Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a> it means to lead or bring away from his previous attitude, i.e., to mislead or seduce, in the sense of enticing to a dangerous enterprise; according to which the Chaldee has rendered it correctly, so far as the actual sense is concerned, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1498;, alliciam te. In the words, "I place rings in thy jaws" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>), Gog is represented as an unmanageable beast, which is compelled to follow its leader (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a>); and the thought is thereby expressed, that Gog is compelled to obey the power of God against his will. &#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;, to lead him away from his land, or natural soil. The passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>, "to deceive the nations (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;), Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle," corresponds to these words so far as the material sense is concerned; with this exception, that Satan is mentioned as the seducer of the nations in the Apocalypse, whereas Ezekiel gives prominence to the leading of God, which controls the manifestations even of evil, "so that these two passages stand in the same relation to one another as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>" (Hv.). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4-6</a> the army is depicted as one splendidly equipped and very numerous. For &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500;, see the comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a>, where the Assyrian satraps are so described. &#1511;&#1492;&#1500; , as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>. The words buckler and shield are loosely appended in the heat of the discourse, without any logical subordination to what precedes. Besides the defensive arms, the greater and smaller shield, they carried swords as weapons of offence. In the case of the nations in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>, only the shield and helmet are mentioned as their equipment, for the sake of variation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a> two other nations of the extreme north with their hosts are added. Gomer: the Cimmerians; and the house of Togarmah: the Armenians (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-14.htm">Ezekiel 27:14</a>). For &#1488;&#1490;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>. The description is finally rounded off with &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; . In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-7.htm">Ezekiel 38:7</a>, the infin. abs. Niphal &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, which occurs nowhere else except in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/4-12.htm">Amos 4:12</a>, is used emphatically in the place of the imperative. The repetition of the same verb, though in the imperative Hiphil, equip, i.e., make ready, sc. everything necessary (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-14.htm">Ezekiel 7:14</a>), also serves to strengthen the thought. Be thou to them &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, for heed, or watch, i.e., as abstr. pro concr., one who gives heed to them, keeps watch over them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-16.htm">Nehemiah 4:16</a>), in actual fact their leader.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-8.htm">Ezekiel 38:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-9.htm">Ezekiel 38:9</a> indicate for what Gog was to hold himself ready. The first clause reminds so strongly of &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-22.htm">Isaiah 24:22</a>, that the play upon this passage cannot possibly be mistaken; so that Ezekiel uses the words in the same sense as Isaiah, though Hvernick is wrong in supposing that &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; is used in the sense of being missed or wanting, i.e., of perishing. The word never has the latter meaning; and to be missed does not suit the context either here or in Isaiah, where &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; means to be visited, i.e., brought to punishment. And here also this meaning, visitari (Vulg.), is to be retained, and that in the sense of a penal visitation. The objection raised, namely, that there is no reference to punishment here, but that this is first mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a> or 18, loses all its force if we bear in mind that visiting is a more general idea than punishing; and the visitation consisted in the fact of God's leading Gog to invade the land of Israel, that He might sanctify Himself upon him by judgment. This might very fittingly be here announced, and it also applies to the parallel clause which follows: thou wilt come into the land, etc., with which the explanation commences of the way in which God would visit him. The only other meaning which could also answer to the parallelism of the clauses, viz., to be commanded, to receive command (Hitzig and Kliefoth), is neither sustained by the usage of the language, nor in accordance with the context. In the passages quoted in support of this, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-1.htm">Nehemiah 7:1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>, &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; merely signifies to be charged with the oversight of a thing; and it never means only to receive command to do anything. Moreover, Gog has already been appointed leader of the army in v.7, and therefore is not "to be placed in the supreme command" for the first time after many days. &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, after many days, i.e., after a long time (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-1.htm">Joshua 23:1</a>), is not indeed equivalent in itself to &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, but signifies merely the lapse of a lengthened period; yet this is defined here as occurring in the &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. - &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, equivalent to &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>), is the end of days, the last time, not the future generally, but the final future, the Messianic time of the completing of the kingdom of God (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>). This meaning is also applicable here. For Gog is to come up to the mountains of Israel, which have been laid waste &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, continually, i.e., for a long time, but are now inhabited again. Although, for example, &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; signifies a period of time relatively long, it evidently indicates a longer period than the seventy or fifty years' desolation of the land during the Babylonian captivity; more especially if we take it in connection with the preceding ad following statements, to the effect that Gog will come into the land, which has been brought back from the sword and gathered out of many peoples. These predicates show that in &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; the idea of the population of the land is the predominant one; for this alone could be gathered out of many nations, and also brought back from the sword, i.e., not from the consequences of the calamity of war, viz., exile (Rosenmller), but restored from being slain and exiled by the sword of the enemy. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;&#1514;, passive participle of the Pilel &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;, to restore (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>); not turned away from the sword, i.e., in no expectation of war (Hitzig), which does not answer to the parallel clause, and cannot be sustained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>. &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; , gathered out of many peoples, points also beyond the Babylonian captivity to the dispersion of Israel in all the world, which did not take place till the second destruction of Jerusalem, and shows that &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; denotes a much longer devastation of the land than the Chaldean devastation was. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; introduces a circumstantial clause; and &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; points back to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, i.e., to the inhabitants of the land. These are now brought out of the nations, i.e., at the time when Gog invades the land, and are dwelling in their own land upon the mountains of Israel in untroubled security. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; signifies the advance of an enemy, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>, etc. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;, a tempest, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, to roar. The comparison to a cloud is limited to the covering; but this does not alter the signification of the cloud as a figurative representation of severe calamity. </body></html>
