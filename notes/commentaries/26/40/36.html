When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Utter court - Translate outward court <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-37.htm">Ezekiel 40:37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-7.htm">Ezekiel 42:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20-21</a>.<p>Arches toward the outward court - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-14.htm">Ezekiel 40:14</a> note.<p>Eight steps - So for the east <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Ezekiel 40:34</a> and north gates <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-37.htm">Ezekiel 40:37</a>. From the precincts to the outer court were "seven" steps, from the outer to the inner court "eight," making together the number of the Psalms Ps. 120-134, supposed by some to have been called Psalms of Degrees, because they were sung by the choir of Levites upon the steps ("degrees") of the temple-courts. In later times these Psalms were used as pilgrims' songs by the Jews who went up from their abodes in foreign countries to Jerusalem on the solemn feasts. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. eight steps&#8212;The outer porch had only seven (Eze 40:26).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he brought me to the north gate,....
