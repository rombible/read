When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The length of the gate - The length of the gateway (including the porch, E.) from the court to the uncovered space.

The meaning appears to be that the barrier took away a cubit on each side from the passage, reducing it from 10 to 8 cubits opposite the guard chambers. The height of the barrier would probably not be very great. The measure of “a cubit” can hardly be the height, as all the measurements refer here to breadth.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The space also before the little chambers</span>; more correctly, <span class="accented">and a border be</span>fore the ledges.

As the barrier projected one cubit on each side of the ten-cubit way, only eight cubits remained for persons going in or out. </body></html>
