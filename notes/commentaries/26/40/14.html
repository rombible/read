When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Posts of threescore cubits - Sixty cubits were the length of a series of columns. This gives us another feature of the gate-building. Between the porch (E) and the two most western guard-chambers was a space of five cubits (through which the road passed), forming a kind of hall with columns along the sides. This hall is called the "arches" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a>. A hall of the same dimensions was between the boundary wall and eastern guard-chambers <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-31.htm">Ezekiel 40:31</a>. It is probable that in one of these halls (that of the eastern gateway of the inner court) the prince "ate bread" on solemn festivals <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>.<p>Unto the post of the court round about the gate - This hall or colonnade extended the whole breadth of the building to the pavement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-18.htm">Ezekiel 40:18</a>, H, Plan II). Outside the building on the pavement was a series of pillars.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. space&#8212;rather, "the boundary."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He made; </span> measured, and thereby showed what kind of posts they should be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Posts of threescore cubits:</span> if this might be interpreted by Cyrus’s edict for building this fabric sixty cubits high, it would be a clear confirmation of the Divine mission of the prophet, and the certainty of a future performance of the good he promised in God’s name, when it appears so evident that he had so long before declared to what height the building should be raised by license from Cyrus. But more like it is that it refers to the height of this gate, built up two stories above the arch, and the posts in their height are only mentioned, but imply all the rest of the building over the east gate. These high columns or posts on the inner front of this gate were so disposed, that the last on each side was very near to the first post, or pillar of the court on either side of the gate; and so the posts, and buildings laid on those posts, joined on each side of this gate. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He made also posts of threescore cubits,.... Jerom thinks, that between the outward wall which surrounded this building, and the building itself, these posts or pillars were placed for ornament, which took up the space of sixty cubits; but rather these design the posts or columns of the gate, which supported the arch over it, on which were rooms or stories, and these were sixty cubits high; for of their height is this measure to be understood. So the Targum, <p>"and he made posts, sixty cubits was their height;'' <p>in the Targum, in the Polyglot Bible by Montanus, it is, <p>"and he made sixty posts, their height a cubit:'' <p>and to this agree Jarchi and Kimchi; these were thirty five yards high, the height of the temple ordered to be built by Cyrus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3</a>. The man that measured is said to "make" these posts, he being the builder as well as the measurer of this edifice; and might be said to make these as, by measuring, he pointed out the size and proportion of them: these posts may design the true members of Gospel churches, such who are pillars in the house of God; of which see more on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a>, compare the phrase of "making" these posts or pillars with <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, <p>even unto the post of the court round about the gate; that is, there was the same measure to every post or pillar in every court, at every gate round about; at the southern and northern gates, as at this eastern one; they were all exactly of the same measure as the posts in this; so Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/40.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-14.htm" title="He made also posts of three score cubits, even to the post of the court round about the gate.">Ezekiel 40:14</a> is obscure. In the first place “he made” is suspicious, everywhere else it is “he measured.” In the second place the number 60 cubits is incomprehensible. The idea that the “posts” were prolonged into pillars of such a height is altogether improbable. Besides, the “posts” are accurately distinguished from pillars, for which another word is employed (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm" title="The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.">Ezekiel 40:49</a></span>). It is to be observed that the measurer first passes in from E. to W. along one side of the gateway, mentioning the different things with their dimensions of which it was composed. Having reached the porch at the inner end he returns, noting that the two sides of the gateway were in all respects alike. Then from <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-11.htm" title="And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.">Ezekiel 40:11</a></span> onwards he gives measurements of the <span class="ital">breadth</span> of various parts of the gateway, the entrance (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-11.htm" title="And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.">Ezekiel 40:11</a></span>), the contraction opposite the guardrooms (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-12.htm" title="The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.">Ezekiel 40:12</a></span>), and finally the breadth of the whole gate building (<span class="ital">v</span>, 13). While, however, the breadth of all other parts of the gateway has been given, that of the “porch” at the inner end has not been mentioned, though its length from E. to W., Fig. 1, <span class="ital">mn</span>, was stated to be 8 cubits (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/40-8.htm" title="He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed....">Ezekiel 40:8-9</a></span>). It is probable, therefore, that <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-14.htm" title="He made also posts of three score cubits, even to the post of the court round about the gate.">Ezekiel 40:14</a></span> supplies this measurement. Render: <span class="bld">and he measured the porch, 20 cubits</span>—reading <span class="ital">porch</span> (ailam), for <span class="ital">posts</span> (ailim), and 20 for 60, in both cases with LXX. The 20 are inside measurement, N. to S.; 22 might have been expected, for the back wall of the guardrooms was 1½ cubits, but a chamber like the porch used for assemblies and feasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-3.htm" title="It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.">Ezekiel 44:3</a>) might well have a wall of 2½ cubits thick, as in point of fact the wall to the W. was two cubits (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-9.htm" title="Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.">Ezekiel 40:9</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even unto the post … gate</span>] At any rate with present pointing: <span class="ital">and unto</span> (touching on) <span class="ital">the post was the court … gate</span>. It is probable, however, that “post” is either repetition of <span class="ital">unto</span>, and should be struck out, or else that it is a consequence of the false reading “posts” in first clause, and should be read “porch” as there (so in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-37.htm" title="And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.">Ezekiel 40:37</a></span>). The latter is more probable: <span class="ital">and unto</span> (adjoining) <span class="ital">the porch was the court, round about the gate</span>. The omission of prep. before “gate” is difficult, but cf. acc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm" title="And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:">1 Kings 6:5</a>, and the more remarkable case <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-17.htm" title="And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.">Ezekiel 43:17</a>. LXX. read differently, and Syr. wants the clause.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He made also posts</span>. In using the verb "made" the prophet either went back in thought to the time when the man who then explained the building had fashioned it (Hengstenberg); or he employed the term in the sense of <span class="accented">constituit</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fixed or estimated, "inasmuch as such a height could not be measured from the bottom to the top with the measuring-red" (Keil). The "posts," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of ver. 9, were sixty cubits high, and corresponded to the towers in modern churches. To the objection sometimes urged against what is called the "exaggerated" height of these columns, Kliefoth replies, "If it had been considered that our church towers have grown up out of gate-pillars, that one can see, not merely in Egyptian obelisks and Turkish minarets, but also in our own hollow factory chimneys, how upon a base of two cubits, square pillars of sixty cubits high can be erected, and that finally the talk is of a colossal building seen in vision, no critical difficulties would have been discovered in this statement as to height." The last clause, <span class="cmt_word">even unto the post of the court round about the gate</span>, should read, <span class="accented">and the court</span> reached <span class="accented">unto the post</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> being used collectively), <span class="accented">the gate</span> being <span class="accented">round about</span> (Revised Version); or, <span class="accented">the court round about the gate</span> reached to <span class="accented">the pillars</span> (Keil); or, <span class="accented">at the pillar the court</span> was round <span class="accented">about the gate</span> (Kliefoth). The sense is, that the court lay round about the inner egress from the gate. The Authorized Version, with which Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' agrees, thinks of an inner hall between the porch of the gate and the two most western guard-chambers, round the sides of which the sixty-cubit columns stood. Ewald, following the corrupt text of the LXX., translates, "And the threshold of the outer vestibule twenty cubits, the gate court abutting on the chambers round about." </body></html>
