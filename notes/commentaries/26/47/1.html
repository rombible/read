The stream is represented as issuing from the summit of “a very high mountain” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm" title="In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), and as constantly and rapidly increasing its volume, without the accession of tributaries, so that in a little more than a mile it becomes a river no longer fordable. The trees upon its banks, too, are evidently symbolical, and its effect upon the Dead Sea (as already said in the introductory note to Ezekiel 40-48) is such as could not naturally occur. Such imagery is common in prophecy. Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>) says, “All the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.” Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>), “Living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea;” and finally, the description of the “pure river of water of life” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1-3</a>, is evidently founded upon this passage of Ezekiel. Passages in which water is used as the symbol of the influence of the Spirit are too numerous and familiar to need quotation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm" title="For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground: I will pour my spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm" title="In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.">Zechariah 13:1</a>, &c.)<p>Ezekiel, having in the previous chapters described the dwelling of the Lord among His people with characteristic minuteness of detail, now proceeds to set forth the blessings that flow from this presence.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Door of the house.—</span>This is the entrance of the Temple itself; the waters come out from under its threshold, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1</a> they proceed “out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.” The prophet, who had just been in the outer court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-21.htm" title="Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.">Ezekiel 46:21</a>, &c.), is brought in to the door of the house that he may see the waters.<p><span class= "bld">From the right side of the house.—</span>Although the waters issue directly from the threshold which was in the centre of the east front of the Temple, and their general course was due east, it was necessary that they should be deflected a little at the start to the south in order to pass the porch and the altar, as well as both the inner and outer gateways.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/ezekiel/47.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Ezekiel<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE RIVER OF LIFE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.">Ezekiel 47:1</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Unlike most great cities, Jerusalem was not situated on a great river. True, the inconsiderable waters of Siloam-’which flow softly’ because they were so inconsiderable-rose from a crevice in the Temple rock, and beneath that rock stretched the valley of the Kedron, dry and bleached in the summer, and a rainy torrent during the rainy seasons; but that was all. So, many of the prophets, who looked forward to the better times to come, laid their finger upon that one defect, and prophesied that it should be cured. Thus we read in a psalm: ‘There is a river, the divisions whereof make glad the City of our God.’ Faith saw what sense saw not. Again, Isaiah says: ‘There’-that is to say, in the new Jerusalem-’the glorious Lord shall be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams.’ And so, this prophet casts his anticipations of the abundant outpouring of blessing that shall come when God in very deed dwells among men, into this figure of a river pouring out from beneath the Temple-door, and spreading life and fertility wherever its waters come. I need not remind you how our Lord Himself uses the same figure, and modifies it, by saying that whosoever believeth on Him, ‘out of him shall flow rivers of living waters’; or how, in the very last words of the Apocalyptic seer, we hear again the music of the ripples of the great stream, ‘the river of the water of life proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb.’ So then, all through Scripture, we may say that we hear the murmur of the stream, and can catch the line of verdure upon its banks. My object now is not only to deal with the words that I have read as a starting-point, but rather to seek to draw out the wonderful significance of this great prophetic parable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. I notice, first, the source from which the river conies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>I have already anticipated that in pointing out that it flows from the very Temple itself. The Prophet sees it coming out of the house-that is to say, the Sanctuary. It flows across the outer court of the house, passes the altar, comes out under the threshold, and then pours itself down on to the plain beneath. This is the symbolical dress of the thought that all spiritual blessings, and every conceivable form of human good, take their rise in the fact of God’s dwelling with men. From beneath the Temple threshold comes the water of life; and wherever it is true that in any heart-or in any community-God dwells, there will be heard the tinkling of its ripples, and freshness and fertility will come from the stream. The dwelling of God with a man, like the dwelling of God in humanity in the Incarnation of His own dear Son, is, as it were, the opening of the fountain that it may pour out into the world. So, if we desire to have the blessings that are possible for us, we must comply with the conditions, and let God dwell in our hearts, and make them His temples; and then from beneath the threshold of that temple, too, will pour out, according to Christ’s own promise, rivers of living water which will be first for ourselves to drink of and be blessed by, and then will refresh and gladden others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Another thought connected with this source of the river of life is that all the blessings which, massed together, are included in that one word ‘salvation’-which is a kind of nebula made up of many unresolved stars-take their rise from nothing else than the deep heart of God Himself. This river rose in the House of the Lord, and amidst the mysteries of the Divine Presence; it took its rise, one might say, from beneath the Mercy-seat where the brooding Cherubim sat in silence and poured itself into a world that had not asked for it, that did not expect it, that in many of its members did not desire it and would not have it. The river that rose in the secret place of God symbolises for us the great thought which is put into plainer words by the last of the apostles when he says, ‘We love Him because He first loved us.’ All the blessings of salvation rise from the unmotived, self-impelled, self-fed divine love and purpose. Nothing moves Him to communicate Himself but His own delight in giving Himself to His poor creatures; and it is all of grace that it might be all through faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Still further, another thought that may be suggested in connection with the source of this river is, that that which is to bless the world must necessarily take its rise above the world. Ezekiel has sketched, in the last portion of his prophecy, an entirely ideal topography of the Holy Land. He has swept away mountains and valleys, and levelled all out into a great plain, in the midst of which rises the mountain of the Lord’s House, far higher than the Temple hill. In reality, opposite it rose the Mount of Olives, and between the two there was the deep gorge of the Valley of the Kedron. The Prophet smooths it all out into one great plain, and high above all towers the Temple-mount, and from it there rushes down on to the low levels the fertilising, life-giving flood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That imaginary geography tells us this, that what is to bless the world must come from above the world. There needs a waterfall to generate electricity; the power which is to come into humanity and deal with its miseries must have its source high above the objects of its energy and its compassion, and in proportion to the height from which it falls will be the force of its impact and its power to generate the quickening impulse. All merely human efforts at social reform, rivers that do not rise in the Temple, are like the rivers in Mongolia, that run for a few miles and then get sucked up by the hot sands and are lost and nobody sees them any more. Only the perennial stream, that comes out from beneath the Temple threshold, can sustain itself in the desert, to say nothing of transforming the desert into a Garden of Eden. So moral and social and intellectual and political reformers may well go to Ezekiel, and learn that the ‘river of the water of life,’ which is to heal the barren and refresh the thirsty land, must come from below the Temple threshold.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Note the rapid increase of the stream.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The Prophet describes how his companion, the interpreter, measured down the stream a thousand cubits-about a quarter of a mile-and the waters were ankle-deep another thousand, making half a mile from the start, and the water was knee-deep. Another thousand-or three-quarters of a mile-and the water was waist-deep; another thousand-about a mile in all-and the water was unfordable, ‘waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.’ Where did the increase come from? There were no tributaries. We do not hear of any side-stream flowing into the main body. Where did the increase come from? It came from the abundant welling-up in the sanctuary. The fountain was the mother of the river-that is to say, God’s ideal for the world, for the Church, for the individual Christian, is rapid increase in their experience of the depth and the force of the stream of blessings which together make up salvation. So we come to a very sharp testing question. Will anybody tell me that the rate at which Christianity has grown for these nineteen centuries corresponds with Ezekiel’s vision-which is God’s ideal? Will any Christian man say, ‘My own growth in grace, and increase in the depth and fulness of the flow of the river through my spirit and my life correspond to that ideal’? A mile from the source the river is unfordable. How many miles from the source of <span class="ital">our</span> first experience do we stand? How many of us, instead of having ‘a river that could not be passed over, waters to swim in,’ have but a poor and all but stagnant feeble trickle, as shallow as or shallower than it was at first?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I was speaking a minute ago about Mongolian rivers. Australian rivers are more like some men’s lives. A chain of ponds in the dry season-nay! not even a chain, but a series, with no connecting channel of water between them. That is like a great many Christian people; they have isolated times when they feel the voice of Christ’s love, and yield themselves to the powers of the world to come, and then there are long intervals, when they feel neither the one nor the other. But the picture that ought to be realised by each of us is God’s ideal, which there is power in the gospel to make real in the case of every one of us, the rapid and continuous increase in the depth and in the scour of ‘the river of the water of life,’ that flows through our lives. Luther used to say, ‘If you want to clean out a dunghill, turn the Elbe into it.’ If you desire to have your hearts cleansed of all their foulness, turn the river into it. But it needs to be a progressively deepening river, or there will be no scour in the feeble trickle, and we shall not be a bit the holier or the purer for our potential and imperfect Christianity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, note the effects of the stream.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>These are threefold: fertility, healing, life. Fertility. In the East one condition of fertility is water. Irrigate the desert, and you make it a garden. Break down the aqueduct, and you make the granary of the world into a waste. The traveller as he goes along can tell where there is a stream of water, by the verdure along its banks. You travel along a plateau, and it is all baked and barren. You plunge into a wâ¤¹, and immediately the ground is clothed with under-growth and shrubs, and the birds of the air sing among the branches. And so, says Ezekiel, wherever the river comes there springs up, as if by magic, fair trees ‘on the banks thereof, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Fertility comes second, the reception of the fertilising agent comes first. It is wasted time to tinker at our characters unless we have begun with getting into our hearts the grace of God, and the new spirit that will be wrought out by diligent effort into all beauty of life and character. Ezekiel seems to be copying the first psalm, or vice versa, the Psalmist is copying Ezekiel. At any rate, there is a verbal similarity between them, in that both dwell upon the unfading leaf of the tree that grows planted by rivers of water. And our text goes further, and speaks about perennial fruitfulness month by month, all the year round. In some tropical countries you will find blossoms, buds in their earliest stage, and ripened fruit all hanging upon one laden branch. Such ought to be the Christian life-continuously fruitful because dependent upon continual drawing into itself, by means of its roots and suckers, of the water of life by which we are fructified.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is yet another effect of the waters-healing. As we said, Ezekiel takes great liberties with the geography of the Holy Land, levelling it all, so his stream makes nothing of the Mount of Olives, but flows due east until it comes to the smitten gorge of the Jordan, and then turns south, down into the dull, leaden waters of the Dead Sea, which it heals. We all know how these are charged with poison. Dip up a glassful anywhere, and you find it full of deleterious matter. They are the symbol of humanity, with the sin that is in solution all through it. No chemist can eliminate it, but there is One who can. ‘He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.’ The pure river of the water of life will cast out from humanity the malignant components that are there, and will sweeten it all. Ay, all, and yet not all, for very solemnly the Prophet’s optimism pauses, and he says that the salt marshes by the side of the sea are not healed. They are by the side of it. The healing is perfectly available for them, but they are not healed. It is possible for men to reject the influences that make for the destruction of sin and the establishment of righteousness. And although the waters are healed, there still remain the obstinate marshes with the white crystals efflorescing on their surface, and bringing salt and barrenness. You can put away the healing and remain tainted with the poison.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And then the last thought is the life-giving influence of the river. Everything lived whithersoever it went. Contrast Christendom with heathendom. Admit all the hollowness and mere nominal Christianity of large tracts of life in so-called Christian countries, and yet why is it that on the one side you find stagnation and death, and on the other side mental and manifold activity and progressiveness? I believe that the difference between ‘the people that <span class="ital">sit</span> in darkness’ and ‘the people that <span class="ital">walk</span> in the light is that one has the light and the other has not, and activity befits the light as torpor befits the darkness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But there is a far deeper truth than that in the figure, a truth that I would fain lay upon the hearts of all my hearers, that unless we our own selves have this water of life which comes from the Sanctuary and is brought to us by Jesus Christ, ‘we are dead in trespasses and sins.’ The only true life is in Christ. ‘If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/47.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.">Ezekiel 47:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">He brought me again to the door of the house — </span>The door of the temple, described <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-2.htm" title="And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.">Ezekiel 41:2</a>. <span class="ital">And behold, waters issued from under the threshold eastward — </span>Ezekiel had repeatedly walked round the house, and had surveyed the doors of it, but had not discovered this stream of water springing from under its threshold till now. Thus God makes known his mind and will to his people, not all at once, but by degrees. Dr. Lightfoot tells us, that there was a large quantity of water conveyed in pipes under ground from the fountain of Etam, for the uses of the temple; and some commentators seem disposed to interpret this part of Ezekiel’s vision, of that water. Others think he only alludes to it, or draws his similitude from it, but is to be mystically understood. Whether he allude to any such conduit, or stream of water, or not, that the waters here spoken of are to be understood mystically, will hardly be doubted by any that consider what is stated concerning their direction and course, their continual increase, and salubrious effects; circumstances all utterly inapplicable to the water said to be brought in pipes for the uses of the temple. <span class="ital">The fore-front of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under the right side of the house, </span>and proceeded <span class="ital">eastward — </span>They did not therefore come to the temple, as if intended for the purposes of washing the sacrifices, carrying off the filth, and keeping every part clean and wholesome; but they issued from it, and proceeded to refresh and fertilize other places. The prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>, <span class="ital">that living waters should go forth from Jerusalem, half of them toward the former sea, and half toward the hinder sea; </span>and St. John’s vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1</a>) <span class="ital">of a pure river of water of life, proceeding out of the</span> <span class="ital">throne of God and the Lamb, </span>elucidate this part of Ezekiel’s vision, and direct us in the application of it. It is undoubtedly to be understood of the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread itself into the countries around; and of the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, and by virtue of which it diffused its influence far and wide, and produced the most blessed effects. Thus Isaiah foretold that <span class="ital">out of Zion should go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>. At Jerusalem it was that the Spirit was poured out upon the apostles, enduing them with the gift of tongues, that they might carry these waters to all nations; and in the temple first they stood and preached the words of this life. But this temple of Ezekiel was not so much designed to be an emblem of the material temple, built after the return of the Jews from Babylon, or of the Jewish Church, which had its principal seat there, as of the Christian Church, the <span class="ital">temple built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, </span>of which Jesus Christ is at once the foundation and chief corner-stone; nay, and also its <span class="ital">threshold </span>and door of entrance: and from him springs <span class="ital">the well, </span>and from him proceed <span class="ital">the rivers of living water, which refresh and comfort the souls of </span>true believers, and render them fruitful to the praise and glory of God: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.">John 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm" title="But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.">John 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-38.htm" title="He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water....">John 7:38-39</a>.

Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The vision of the waters; or, the blessings which flow from this source to animate and refresh all the inhabitants of the earth. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-8.htm">Isaiah 44:8</a>...; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>. Ezekiel's description is adopted and modifled by Zechariah and in Rev. (compare the marginal references) Hebrew tradition speaks of a spring of water, named Etham, said to be identical with the well-waters of Nephtoah <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-15.htm">Joshua 18:15</a>, on the west of the temple, whose waters were conducted by pipes into the temple-courts for the uses needed in the ministration of the priests. The waters of Shiloah <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a> flowed from the rocks beneath the temple-hill. It is quite in the manner of Ezekiel's vision to start from an existing feature and thence proceed to an ideal picture from where to draw a spiritual lesson. The deepening of the waters in their course shows the continual deepening of spiritual life and multiplication of spiritual blessings in the growth of the kingdom of God. So long as the stream is confined to the temple-courts, it is merely a small rill, for the most part unseen, but when it issues from the courts it begins at once to deepen and to widen. So on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended upon the company of believers, little then but presently to develop into the infant Church in Jerusalem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 47<p>Eze 47:1-23. Vision of the Temple Waters. Borders and Division of The land.<p>The happy fruit to the earth at large of God's dwelling with Israel in holy fellowship is that the blessing is no longer restricted to the one people and locality, but is to be diffused with comprehensive catholicity through the whole world. So the plant from the cedar of Lebanon is represented as gathering under its shelter "all fowl of every wing" (Eze 17:23). Even the desert places of the earth shall be made fruitful by the healing waters of the Gospel (compare Isa 35:1).<p>1. waters&#8212;So Re 22:1, represents "the water of life as proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb." His throne was set up in the temple at Jerusalem (Eze 43:7). Thence it is to flow over the earth (Joe 3:18; Zec 13:1; 14:8). Messiah is the temple and the door; from His pierced side flow the living waters, ever increasing, both in the individual believer and in the heart. The fountains in the vicinity of Moriah suggested the image here. The waters flow eastward, that is, towards the Kedron, and thence towards the Jordan, and so along the Ghor into the Dead Sea. The main point in the picture is the rapid augmentation from a petty stream into a mighty river, not by the influx of side streams, but by its own self-supply from the sacred miraculous source in the temple [Henderson]. (Compare Ps 36:8, 9; 46:4; Isa 11:9; Hab 2:14). Searching into the things of God, we find some easy to understand, as the water up to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters up to the knees or loins; others beyond our reach, of which we can only adore the depth (Ro 11:33). The healing of the waters of the Dead Sea here answers to "there shall be no more curse" (Re 22:3; compare Zec 14:11).The vision of the holy waters, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar....">Ezekiel 47:1-5</a></span>.

The door of the temple, even of the holy of holies; hither the prophet is said to be brought again, or "brought back" (x); for he was last in the corners of the outward court, viewing the kitchens or boiling places of the ministers; but now he was brought back into the inner court, and to the door that led into the holiest of all: <p>and, behold! for it was matter of admiration, as well as of observation and attention: <p>waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; this is a new thing, to which there was nothing like it, either in the first or second temple. Ariateas (y) indeed relates what he himself saw, <p>"a never failing conflux of water, as of a large fountain, naturally flowing underneath, and wonderful receptacles under ground; to each of which were leaden pipes, through which the waters came in on every side, for about half a mile about the temple, and washed away the blood of the sacrifices;'' <p>and so the Talmudists (z) say, there was an aqueduct from the fountain of Etam, and pipes laid from thence to supply the temple with water, for the washing and boiling of the sacrifices, and keeping the temple clean: but these waters are quite different; they are such as came out of the temple, and not what were carried by pipes into it; nor were they a common sewer to carry off the filth of it, but formed a delightful and useful river. The fountain of them is not declared, only where they were first seen to issue out, <p>under the threshold of the house eastward; the threshold of the door of the most holy place; so that they seem to take their rise from the holy of holies, the seat of the divine Majesty, and throne of God, with which agrees <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>, and so the Talmudists (a) say, that this fountain came first from the house of the holy of holies, under the threshold of the door of it, which looked to the east: <p>for the fore front of the house stood toward the east; the holy of holies was at the west end of the temple; but the front of it, and so the door into it, was to the east, and from hence these waters flowed: <p>and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house; they are said to "come down", because the temple was high built upon the top of a mountain; and "from under", that is, the threshold of the door of it; or rather in subterraneous passages, till they appeared from under that; and this was "on the right side of the house"; that is, on the south side: for, suppose a man standing with his face to the east, as the prophet did, when he turned himself to see which way the waters flowed, having his face to the west when he first saw them come out; the south then must be on his right hand, and so it follows: <p>at the south side of the altar; of the altar of burnt offerings, which stood before the house. <p>(x) "reduxit me", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Starckius.

And he brought me out into the outer court by the way toward the north, and brought me to the cell-building, which was opposite to the separate place, and opposite to the building toward the north, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2</a>. Before the long side of a hundred cubits, with the door toward the north, and the breadth fifty cubits, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a>. Opposite to the twenty of the inner court and opposite to the stone pavement of the outer-court; gallery against gallery was in the third storey. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-4.htm">Ezekiel 42:4</a>. And before the cells a walk, ten cubits broad; to the inner a way of a hundred cubits; and their doors went to the north. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm">Ezekiel 42:5</a>. And the upper cells were shortened, because the galleries took away space from them, in comparison with the lower and the central ones in the building. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-6.htm">Ezekiel 42:6</a>. For they were three-storied, and had no columns, like the columns of the courts; therefore a deduction was made from the lower and from the central ones from the ground. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-7.htm">Ezekiel 42:7</a>. And a wall outside parallel with the cells ran toward the outer court in front of the cells; its length fifty cubits. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-8.htm">Ezekiel 42:8</a>. For the length of the cells of the outer court was fifty cubits, and, behold, against the sanctuary it was a hundred cubits. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-9.htm">Ezekiel 42:9</a>. And out from underneath it rose up these cells; the entrance was from the east, when one went to them from the outer court. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-10.htm">Ezekiel 42:10</a>. In the breadth of the court wall toward the south, before the separate place and before the building, there were cells, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-11.htm">Ezekiel 42:11</a>. With a way before them, like the cells, which stood toward the north, as according to their length so according to their breadth, and according to all their exits as according to all their arrangements. And as their doorways, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-12.htm">Ezekiel 42:12</a>. So were also the doorways of the cells, which were toward the south, an entrance at the head of the way, of the way opposite to the corresponding wall, of the way from the east when one came to them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>. And he said to me, The cells in the north, the cells in the south, which stood in front of the separate place, are the holy cells where the priests, who draw near to Jehovah, shall eat the most holy thing; there they shall place the most holy thing, both the meat-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>. When they go in, the priests, they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court; but there shall they place their clothes, in which they perform the service, for they are holy; they shall put on other clothes, and so draw near to what belongs to the people.<p>It is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>, which furnish particulars concerning the cells already described, that the description itself refers to two cell-buildings only, one on the north side and the other on the south side of the separate place (see Plate I L). Of these the one situated on the north is described in a more circumstantial manner (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-9</a>); that on the south, on the contrary, is merely stated in the briefest manner to have resembled the other in the main (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-10.htm">Ezekiel 42:10-12</a>). That these two cell-buildings are not identical either with those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a>. or with those of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a>, as Hvernick supposes, but are distinct from both, is so obvious that it is impossible to understand how they could ever have been identified. The difference in the description is sufficient to show that they are not the same as those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a>. The cells mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a> were set apart as dwelling-places for the priests during their administration of the service in the holy place and at the altar; whereas these serve as places for depositing the most holy sacrificial gifts and the official dresses of the priests. To this may be added the difference of situation, which distinguishes those mentioned here both from those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a>., and also from those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a>. Those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a> were in the inner court, ours in the outer. It is true that those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a> were also in the latter, but in entirely different situations, as the description of the position of those noticed in the chapter before us indisputably proves. Ezekiel is led out of the inner court into the outer, by the way in the direction toward the north, to &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, the cell-building (that &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is used here in a collective sense is evident from the plural &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-4.htm">Ezekiel 42:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm">Ezekiel 42:5</a>). This stood opposite to the gizrah, i.e., the separate space behind the temple house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>.), and opposite to the &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., neither the outer court wall, which is designated as &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>, but cannot be intended here, where there is no further definition, nor the temple house, as Kliefoth imagines, for this is invariably called &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;. We have rather to understand by &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; the building upon the gizrah described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>., to which no valid objection can be offered on the ground of the repetition of the relative &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as it is omitted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-10.htm">Ezekiel 42:10</a>, and in general simply serves to give greater prominence to the second definition in the sense of "and, indeed, opposite to the building (sc., of the separate place) toward the north."<p>As &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; belongs to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; as a more precise definition of the direction indicated by &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, the '&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488; which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2</a> depends upon &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, and is co-ordinate with &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, defining the side of the cell-building to which Ezekiel was taken: "to the face of the length," i.e., to the long side of the building, which extended to a hundred cubits. The article in &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; requires that the words should be connected in this manner, as it could not be used if the words were intended to mean "on the surface of a length of a hundred cubits." Since, then, the separate place was also a hundred cubits, that is to say, of the same length as the cell-building opposite to it, we might be disposed to assume that as the separate place reached to the outer court wall on the west, the cell-building also extended to the latter with its western narrow side. But this would be at variance with the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19-20</a>, the sacrificial kitchens for the priests stood at the western end of this portion of the court, and therefore behind the cell-building. The size of these kitchens is not given; but judging from the size of the sacrificial kitchens for the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-22.htm">Ezekiel 46:22</a>), we must reserve a space of forty cubits in length; and consequently the cell-building, which was a hundred cubits long, if built close against the kitchens, would reach the line of the back wall of the temple house with its front (or eastern) narrow side, since, according to the calculation given in the comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1-11</a>, this wall was forty cubits from the front of the separate place, so that there was no prominent building standing opposite to the true sanctuary on the northern or southern side, by which any portion of it could have been concealed. And not only is there no reason for leaving a vacant space between the sacrificial kitchens and the cell-buildings, but this is precluded by the fact that if the kitchens had been separated from the cell building by an intervening space, it would have been necessary to carry the holy sacrificial flesh from the kitchen to the cell in which it was eaten, after being cooked, across a portion of the outer court. It is not stated here how far this cell-building was from the northern boundary of the gizrah, and the open space (&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;) surrounding the temple house; but this may be inferred from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-10.htm">Ezekiel 41:10</a>, according to which the intervening space between the munnach and the cells was twenty cubits. For the cells mentioned there can only be those of our cell-building, as there were no other cells opposite to the northern and southern sides of the temple house. But if the distance of the southern longer side of the cell-building, so far as it stood opposite to the temple house, was only twenty cubits, the southern wall of the cell-building coincided with the boundary wall of the inner court, so that it could be regarded as a continuation of that wall. - The further definition &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; , door to the north, is to be taken as subordinate to the preceding clause, in the sense of "with the door to the north," because it would otherwise come in between the accounts of the length and breadth of the building, so as to disturb the connection. The breadth of the building corresponds to the breadth of the gate-buildings of the inner court.<p>The meaning of the third verse is a subject of dispute. "&#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;," says Bttcher, "is difficult on account of the article as well as the number, inasmuch as, with the exception of the twenty cubits left open in the temple ground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-10.htm">Ezekiel 41:10</a>), there are no &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; mentioned as belonging to the actual '&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1492;&#1508;&#1503;, and the numeral does not stand with sufficient appropriateness by the side of the following &#1512;&#1510;&#1508;&#1492;." But there is not sufficient weight in the last objection to render the reference to the twenty cubits a doubtful one, since the "twenty cubits" is simply a contracted form of expression for "the space of twenty cubits," and this space forms a fitting antithesis to the pavement (&#1512;&#1510;&#1508;&#1492;), i.e., the paved portion of the court. Moreover, it is most natural to supply the missing substantive to the "twenty" from the &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; mentioned just before, - much more natural certainly than to supply &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, as there is no allusion either before or afterwards to any other cells than those whose situation is intended to be defined according to the twenty. We therefore agree with J. H. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Hvernick, and Hitzig, that the only admissible course is to supply &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;; for the description of the priests' cells in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a>, to which Kliefoth imagines that &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; refers, is far too distant for us to be able to take the word &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; thence and supply it to &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. And again, the situation of these priests' cells to the east of the cell-building referred to here does not harmonize with the &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, as the second definition introduced by the correlative &#1493;&#1504;&#1490;&#1491; points to the stone pavement on the north. East and north do not form such a vis--vis as the double &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; requires. - Our view of the &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; eht is also in harmony with the explanatory relative clause, "which were to the inner court," i.e., belonged to it. For the open space of twenty cubits' breadth, which ran by the long side of the temple house between the munnach belonging to the temple and the wall of the inner court, formed the continuation of the inner court which surrounded the temple house on the north, west, and south.<p>(Note: The statement of Kliefoth, that "this space of twenty cubits in breadth did not belong to the inner court at all," cannot be established from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>, where the size of the inner court is given as a hundred cubits in length and the same in breadth. For this measurement simply refers to the space in front of the temple.)<p>If, therefore, this first definition of the &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; refers to what was opposite to the cell-building on the south, the second &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; defines what stood opposite to it on the northern side. There the portion of the outer court which was paved with stones ran along the inner side of the surrounding wall. This serves to define as clearly as possible the position of the broad side of the cell-building. For Kliefoth and Hitzig are right in connecting these definitions with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2</a>, and taking the words from &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; onwards as introducing a fresh statement. Even the expression itself &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; does not properly harmonize with the combination of the two halves of the third verse as one sentence, as Bttcher proposes, thus: "against the twenty cubits of the inner court and against the pavement of the outer court there ran gallery in front of gallery threefold." For if the galleries of the building were opposite to the pavement on the north, and to the space in front of the temple on the south of the building, they must of necessity have run along the northern and southern walls of the building in a parallel direction, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is not the correct expression for this. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, to the front - that is to say, one gallery to the front of the other, or up to the other. This could only be the case if the galleries surrounded the building on all four sides, or at any rate on three; for with the latter arrangement, the gallery upon the eastern side would terminate against those on the southern and northern sides. Again, the rendering "threefold," or into the threefold, cannot be defended either from the usage of the language or from the facts. The only other passage in which the plural &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; occurs is <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-16.htm">Genesis 6:16</a>, where it signifies chambers, or rooms of the third storey, and the singular &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; means the third. Consequently &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is "in the third row of chambers or rooms," i.e., in the third storey. And so far as the fact is concerned, it does not follow from the allusion to upper, central, and lower cells (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm">Ezekiel 42:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-6.htm">Ezekiel 42:6</a>), that there were galleries round every one of the three storeys.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-4.htm">Ezekiel 42:4</a>. "Before the cells there was a walk of ten cubits' breadth" (m). In what sense we are to understand &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, "before," whether running along the northern longer side of the building, or in front of the eastern wall, depends upon the explanation of the words which follow, and chiefly of the words &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, by which alone the sense in which &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; is to be understood can also be determined. Hvernick and Kliefoth take &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, "a way of one cubit," in the sense of "the approaches (entrances into the rooms) were a cubit broad." But the words cannot possibly have this meaning; not only because the collective use of &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; after the preceding &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, which is not collective, and with the plural &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; following, is extremely improbable, if not impossible; but principally because &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, a way, is not synonymous with &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;, an entrance, or &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, a doorway. Moreover, an entrance, if only a cubit in breadth, to a large building would be much too narrow, and bear no proportion whatever to the walk of ten cubits in breadth. It is impossible to get any suitable meaning from the words as they stand, "a way of one cubit;" and no other course remains than to alter &#1488;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; into &#1502;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;, after the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; of the Septuagint. There is no question that we have such a change of &#1502;&#1488;&#1492; into &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>, where even the Rabbins acknowledge that it has occurred. And when once &#1502;&#1488;&#1492; had been turned into &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, this change would naturally be followed by the alteration of &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; into a numeral - that is to say, into &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;. The statement itself, "a way of a hundred cubits" (in length), might be taken as referring to the length of the walk in front of the cells, as the cell-building was a hundred cubits long. But &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; is hardly reconcilable with this. If, for example, we take these words in connection with the preceding clause, "a walk of ten cubits broad into the interior," the statement, "a way of a hundred cubits," does not square with this. For if the walk which ran in front of the cells was a hundred cubits long, it did not lead into the interior of the cell-building, but led past it to the outer western wall. We must therefore take  &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; in connection with what follows, so that it corresponds to &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;: in front of the cells there was a walk of ten cubits in breadth, and to the inner there led a way of a hundred cubits in length. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; would then signify, not the interior of the cell-building, but the inner court (&#1492;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-27.htm">Ezekiel 21:27</a>, etc.). This explanation derives its principal support from the circumstance that, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-9.htm">Ezekiel 42:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-11.htm">Ezekiel 42:11</a>, a way ran from the east, i.e., from the steps of the inner court gates, on the northern and southern sides, to the cell-buildings on the north and south of the separate place, the length of which, from the steps of the gate-buildings already mentioned to the north-eastern and south-eastern corners of our cell-buildings, was exactly a hundred cubits, as we may see from the plan in Plate I. This way (l) was continued in the walk in front of the cells (m), and may safely be assumed to have been of the same breadth as the walk. - The last statement of the fourth verse is perfectly clear; the doorways to the cells were turned toward the north, so that one could go from the walk in front of the cells directly into the cells themselves.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm">Ezekiel 42:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-6.htm">Ezekiel 42:6</a> there follow certain statements concerning the manner in which the cells were built. The building contained upper, lower, and middle cells; so that it was three-storied. This is expressed in the words &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; , "for the cells were tripled;" three rows stood one above another. But they were not all built alike; the upper ones were shortened in comparison with the lower and the central ones, i.e., were shorter than these (&#1502;&#1503; before &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is comparative); "for galleries ate away part of them" - that is to say, took away a portion of them (&#1497;&#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, in an architectural sense, to take away from). How far this took place is shown in the first two clauses of the sixth verse, the first of which explains the reference to upper, lower, and middle cells, while the second gives the reason for the shortening of the upper in comparison with the lower and the central cones. As the three rows of cells built one above another had no columns on which the galleries of the upper row could rest, it was necessary, in order to get a foundation for the gallery of the third storey, that the cells should be thrown back from the outer wall, or built as far inwards as the breadth of the gallery required. This is expressly stated in the last clause, '&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1500; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. &#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1500;, with an indefinite subject: there was deducted from the lower and the middle cells from the ground, sc. which these rooms covered. &#1502;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is added for the purpose of elucidation. From the allusion to the columns of the courts we may see that the courts had colonnades, like the courts in the Herodian temple, and probably also in that of Solomon, though their character is nowhere described, and no allusion is made to them in the description of the courts.<p>The further statements concerning this cell-building in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-7.htm">Ezekiel 42:7-9</a> are obscure. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; is a wall serving to enclose courtyards, vineyards, and the like. The predicate to &#1493;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; follows in &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;: a boundary wall ran along the front of the cells (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; stands for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; rof sdn, as the corresponding &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-8.htm">Ezekiel 42:8</a> shows). The course of this wall (n) is more precisely defined by the relative clause, "which ran outwards parallel with the cells in the direction of the outer court," i.e., toward the outer court. The length of this wall was fifty cubits. It is evident from this that the wall did not run along the north side of the building, - for in that case it must have been a hundred cubits in length, - but along the narrow side, the length of which was fifty cubits. Whether it was on the western or eastern side cannot be determined with certainty from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-7.htm">Ezekiel 42:7</a>, although &#1488;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; favours the eastern, i.e., the front side, rather than the western side, or back. And what follows is decisive in favour of the eastern narrow side. In explanation of the reason why this wall was fifty cubits long, it is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-8.htm">Ezekiel 42:8</a> that "the length of the cells, which were to the outer court, was fifty cubits; but, behold, toward the temple front a hundred cubits." Consequently "the cells which the outer court had" can only be the cells whose windows were toward the outer court - that is to say, those on the eastern narrow side of the building; for the sacrificial kitchens were on the western narrow side (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19-20</a>). The second statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-8.htm">Ezekiel 42:8</a>, which is introduced by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is an indication of something important, is intended to preclude any misinterpretation of &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;' fo noitat, as though by length we must necessarily understand the extension of the building from east to west, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2</a> and most of the other measurements. The use of &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; for the extension of the narrow side of the building is also suggested by the &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, "length of the wall," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-7.htm">Ezekiel 42:7</a>, where &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; would have been inadmissible, because &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;, the breadth of a wall, would have been taken to mean its thickness. &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; is the outer side of the temple house which faced the north.<p>A further confirmation of the fact that the boundary wall was situated on the eastern narrow side of the building is given in the first clause of the ninth verse, in which, however, the reading fluctuates. The Chetib gives &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, the Keri &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1492;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;. But as we generally find, the Keri is an alteration for the worse, occasioned by the objection felt by the Masoretes, partly to the unusual circumstance that the singular form of the suffix is attached to &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, whereas it usually takes the suffixes in the plural form, and partly to the omission of the article from &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; by the side of the demonstrative &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which is defined by the article. But these two deviations from the ordinary rule do not warrant any alterations, as there are analogies in favour of both. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; has a singular suffix not only in &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a>) and &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-37.htm">2 Samuel 22:37</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-40.htm">2 Samuel 22:40</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-48.htm">2 Samuel 22:48</a>), instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-37.htm">Psalm 18:37</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-40.htm">Psalm 18:40</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a>), which may undoubtedly be explained on the ground that the direction whither is thought of (Ges. 103. 1, Anm. 3), but also in &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, which occurs more frequently than &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, and that without any difference in the meaning (compare, for example, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-21.htm">Deuteronomy 2:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-7.htm">Joshua 5:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-24.htm">Job 34:24</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-12.htm">Job 40:12</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-24.htm">1 Kings 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-22.htm">1 Chronicles 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-10.htm">2 Chronicles 12:10</a>). And &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is analogous to &#1492;&#1512;  in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>, and many other combinations, in which the force of the definition (by means of the article) is only placed in the middle for the sake of convenience (vid., Ewald, &#1431;293a). If, therefore, the Chetib is to be taken without reserve as the original reading, the suffix in &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; can only refer to &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;, which is of common gender: from underneath the wall were these cells, i.e., the cells turned toward the outer court; and the meaning is the following: toward the bottom these cells were covered by the wall, which ran in front of them, so that, when a person coming toward them from the east fixed his eyes upon these cells, they appeared to rise out of the wall. Kliefoth, therefore, who was the first to perceive the true meaning of this clause, has given expression to the conjecture that the design of the wall was to hide the windows of the lower row of cells which looked toward the east, so that, when the priests were putting on their official clothes, they might not be seen from the outside. - &#1492;&#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; commences a fresh statement. To connect these words with the preceding clause ("underneath these cells was the entrance from the east"), as Bttcher has done, yields no meaning with which a rational idea can possibly be associated, unless the &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; be altogether ignored. The lxx have therefore changed &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, which was unintelligible to them, into &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#1493;&#1508;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497;), and Hitzig has followed them in doing so. No such conjecture is necessary if &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; be rightly interpreted, for in that case &#1492;&#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; must be the commencement of a new sentence. &#1492;&#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; (by the side of which the senseless reading of the Keri &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; cannot be taken into consideration for a moment) is the approach, or the way which led to the cells. This was from the east, from the outer court, not from the inner court, against the northern boundary of which the building stood. &#1502;&#1492;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1492;&#1495;&#1510;&#1504;&#1492; is not to be taken in connection with &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, but is co-ordinate with &#1502;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, of which it is</body></html>
