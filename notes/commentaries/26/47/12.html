These trees with their supernatural virtues are represented as produced by the waters because “they issued out of the sanctuary,” thus presenting a most effective image of the life-giving power of those spiritual influences which come from God upon men.<p>It has been objected to the spiritual interpretation of this vision, that under it nothing can be made of the fishermen of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand on it from Engedi even to Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.">Ezekiel 47:10</a>, and that, therefore, the whole is to be considered as a glorification of nature in the future Palestine. But this is to forget that in every figure and parable there are, and must be, details necessary to the figure which have nothing answering to them in the thing signified, and that it is the habit of Ezekiel to carry out such details very far. In this case, the mention of the fishermen greatly heightens the imagery of the life-giving power of the waters; while, if the whole were to be literally understood, they would really have no place, because there would be no such fishermen in the supposed glorified condition of the land.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-13.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.">Ezekiel 47:13-23</a>, which, as already said, properly belong to Ezekiel 48, give the boundaries of the land to be divided among the tribes, together with provision for the inheritance of strangers living among them.

There is a great variety of these trees, through the diversity of gifts with which they are endued by that one Spirit which works <span class="ital">all in all. </span>They grow on the bank of the river, for they keep close to holy ordinances, and through them derive sap and virtue from Christ. They are fruit-trees, designed, as the fig-tree and the olive, to honour with their fruits both God and man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-9.htm" title="But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?">Jdg 9:9</a>. <span class="ital">The fruit thereof shall be for meat, </span>for <span class="ital">the lips of the righteous feed many, </span>and the fruits of their righteousness are many ways beneficial.

Therefore their profession shall not wither, nor their discourse lose its healing, strengthening virtue. <span class="ital">Neither shall their fruit be consumed — </span>That is, they shall not cease to bear fruit, retaining still the principles of their fruitfulness; but shall bring it forth even in old age. Or, the reward of their fruitfulness shall abide for ever; they shall produce fruit that shall abound to their account at the appearing of Jesus Christ, fruit to life eternal. <span class="ital">They shall bring forth new fruit according to their months — </span>Some in one month and others in another; or, each one of them shall bring forth fruit monthly; which signifies a constant disposition, desire, resolution, and endeavour to bear fruit, and that they shall never be <span class="ital">weary of well-doing. </span>And the reason of this extraordinary fruitfulness is, <span class="ital">because their waters issue out of the sanctuary — </span>It is not to be ascribed to their own wisdom, power, or goodness, or to any thing in themselves, but to the continual supplies of divine grace, with which they are watered every moment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-3.htm" title="I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.">Isaiah 27:3</a>.

Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The exception, which reserves for sterility places to which the living water does not reach, probably indicates that the life and health are solely due to the stream which proceeds from beneath the throne of God.

grow up in him, and grow upwards and heavenwards in their affections and desires, and in the exercise of faith and hope: they are the trees of the Lord, trees of righteousness, good trees, that bring forth good fruit;

One natural fact was this, that there was a fountain connected with the temple-hill, the waters of which fell into the valley east of the city and made their way towards the sea; and long ere this time the gentle waters of this brook, that flowed fast by the oracle of God, had furnished symbols to the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm" title="For as much as this people refuses the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;">Isaiah 8:6</a>). Such waters in the east are the source of every blessing to men. The religious conceptions are such as these: that Jehovah himself is the giver of all blessings to men, and from his presence all blessings flow. He was now present in his fulness and for ever in his temple. Hence the prophet sees the life-giving stream issue from the sanctuary. Another current idea was that in the regeneration of men, when the tabernacle of God was with them, external nature would also be transfigured. Then every good would be enjoyed and there would be no more evil nor curse. The desert would blossom like the rose, and the field that aforetime was thought fruitful should be accounted no better than bush. The barren land toward the east and the bitter waters of the sea were a contradiction to the ideal of an external nature subservient in all her parts to man in the fellowship of God. Therefore the desert shall be fertilized and the waters of the sea healed, and all things minister to man’s good. But “good” to the Israelite was not exclusively spiritual, it was also material. It would be an error to regard this fertilizing, healing stream in the light of a mere symbol for blessings which we call “spiritual.” It is well fitted in other connexions to be such a symbol; but to take it so here would be to overstep the limits of the Old Testament and anticipate a later revelation. As yet the Israelite had no conception of a transcendent sphere of existence for men in the fellowship of God, such as we name heaven. Man’s final abode even in his perfect state was considered to be still on the earth. God came down and dwelt with men; men were not translated to abide with God. But God’s presence with men on earth gave to earth the attributes of heaven. Yet man’s needs remained, and God’s presence was the source of all things necessary to supply them. When he had the needful blessings the Israelite saw in them the tokens and the sacraments of God’s favour and presence with him; and conversely when God was near him he was assured that he should want no good thing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-9.htm" title="O fear the LORD, you his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.">Psalm 34:9</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The effect of the river upon the vegetation growing on its banks is the last feature added to the prophet's picture.

But as that space was five hundred cubits long and five hundred broad, according to the sum of the measurements given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-42</a>:15, the lxx have omitted the word &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-19.htm">Ezekiel 42:19</a>, whilst they have changed it into &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-17.htm">Ezekiel 42:17</a>, and have also attached this word to the numbers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a>. According to this, only the outer circumference of the temple area would be measured in our verses, and the wall which was five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a>) would be the surrounding wall of the outer court mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-15.htm">Ezekiel 42:15</a> could certainly be made to harmonize with this view. For even if we understood by the "inner house" not merely the temple house, which the expression primarily indicates, but the whole of the inner building, i.e., all the buildings found in the inner and outer court, and by the east gate the eastern gate of the outer court; the expression '&#1502;&#1491;&#1491;&#1493; &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; , "he measured it round about," merely affirms that he measured something round about outside this gate. The suffix in &#1502;&#1491;&#1491;&#1493; is indefinite, and cannot be taken as referring to any of the objects mentioned before, either to &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; or to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;. The inner house he had already measured; and the measurements which follow are not applicable to the gate. Nor can the suffix be taken as referring to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, illam sc. aedem (Ros.); or at any rate, there is nothing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a> to sustain such a reference. Nevertheless, we might think of a measuring of the outer sides of the whole building comprehended under the idea of the inner house, and regard the wall mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a> as that which had been measured round about on the outer side both in length and breadth. But it is difficult to reconcile this view even with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a>; and with the measurements given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16-19</a> it is perfectly irreconcilable. Even if we were disposed to expunge &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as a gloss in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-17.htm">Ezekiel 42:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-19.htm">Ezekiel 42:19</a>, the words, "he measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred by the measuring rod," are equivalent to five hundred rods, according to the well-known Hebrew usage; just as indisputably as &#1502;&#1488;&#1492;, a hundred by the cubit, is equivalent to a hundred cubits (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a> at the close). The rejection of &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as an imaginary gloss is therefore not only arbitrary, but also useless; as the appended words &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, even without &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, affirm that the five hundred were not cubits, but rods.<p>(Note: The &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a> is utterly useless as a proof that cubits and not rods are intended; as it is obviously a copyist's error, a fact which even the Masoretes admit. Rabbi ben-Asher's view of this writing is an interesting one. Prof. Dr. Delitzsch has sent me the following, taken from a fragment in his possession copied from a codex of the Royal Library at Copenhagen. R. ben-Asher reckons &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; among the &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501; &#1493;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1495;&#1512;, i.e., words written &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, of which there are forty-seven in the whole of the Old Testament, the following being quoted by ben-Asher (l.c.) by way of example: &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-27.htm">Joshua 21:27</a>; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14</a>; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-28.htm">2 Samuel 15:28</a>; &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-26.htm">Judges 16:26</a>; &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>.)<p>The &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-17.htm">Ezekiel 42:17</a> is not to be understood as signifying that on the east and north sides he measured a square on each side of five hundred rods in length and breadth, but simply indicates that he measured on all sides, as is obvious from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a>. For according to this, the space which was measured toward every quarter at five hundred rods had a boundary wall, which was five hundred rods long on every side. This gives an area of 250,000 square rods; whereas the temple,with the inner and outer courts, covered only a square of five hundred cubits in length and breadth, or 250,000 square cubits. It is evident from this that the measuring related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-15.htm">Ezekiel 42:15-20</a> does not refer to the space occupied by the temple and its courts, and therefore that the wall which the measured space had around it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a>) cannot be the wall of the outer court mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>, the sides of which were not more than five hundred cubits long. The meaning is rather, that around this wall, which enclosed the temple and its courts, a further space of five hundred rods in length and breadth was measured off "to separate between the holy and profane," i.e., a space which was intended to form a separating domain between the sanctuary and the common land. The purpose thus assigned for the space, which was measured off on all four sides of the "inner house," leaves no doubt remaining that it was not the length of the surrounding wall of the outer court that was measured, but a space outside this wall. The following clause &#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492; , "a wall was round about it," is irreconcilable with the idea that the suffix in &#1502;&#1491;&#1491;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-15.htm">Ezekiel 40:15</a>) refers to this wall, inasmuch as the &#1500;&#1493; can only refer to the object indicated by the suffix attached to &#1502;&#1491;&#1491;&#1493;. This object, i.e., the space which was five hundred rods long and the same broad round about, i.e., on every one of the four sides, had a wall enclosing it on the outside, and forming the partition between the holy and the common. &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is therefore &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;, "the inner house;" but this is not the temple house with its side-building, but the sanctuary of the temple with its two courts and their buildings, which was measured in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5-42:12</a>.<p>The arguments which have been adduced in opposition to this explanation of our verses, - the only one in harmony with the words of the text, - and in vindication of the alterations made in the text by the lxx, are without any force. According to Bttcher (p. 355), Hitzig, and others, &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is likely to be a false gloss, (1) "because &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; stands close to it; and while this is quite needless after &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, it may also have occasioned the gloss." But this tells rather against the suspicion that &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is a gloss, since, as we have already observed, according to the Hebrew mode of expression, the "five hundred" would be defined as rods by &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, even without &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. Ezekiel, however, had added &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; for the purpose of expressing in the clearest manner the fact that the reference here is not to cubits, but to a new measurement of an extraordinary kind, to which nothing corresponding could be shown in the earlier temple. And the Seventy, by retaining this clause, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, have pronounced sentence upon their own change of the rods into cubits; and it is no answer to this that the Talmud (Midd. c. ii. note 5) also gives only five hundred cubits to the &#1492;&#1512; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;, since this Talmudic description is treating of the historical temple and not of Ezekiel's prophetic picture of a temple, although the Rabbins have transferred various statements from the latter to the former. The second and third reasons are weaker still - viz. "because there is no other instance in which the measurement is expressed by rods in the plural; and, on the other hand, &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is frequently omitted as being the ordinary measurement, and therefore taken for granted." For the first assertion is proved to be erroneous, not only by our verses, but also by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-16.htm">Ezekiel 48:16</a>., whilst there is no force whatever in the second. The last argument employed is a more plausible one - namely, that "the five hundred rods are not in keeping with the sanctuary, because the edifice with the courts and gates would look but a little pile according to the previous measurements in the wide expanse of 20,000 (?) rods." But although the space measured off around the temple-building for the separation between the holy and the profane was five times as long and five times as broad, according to the Hebrew text, or twenty-five times as large as the whole extent of the temple and its courts,<p>(a) Area of the temple with the two courts, 500 cubits square.<p>(b) Surrounding space, five hundred rods  equals  3000 cubits square.<p>(c) Circuit of fifty cubits in breadth around the surrounding space. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a><p>the appearance of the temple with its courts is not diminished in consequence, because the surrounding space was not covered with buildings; on the contrary, the fact that it was separated from the common by so large a surrounding space, would rather add to the importance of the temple with its courts. This broad separation is peculiar to Ezekiel's temple, and serves, like many other arrangements in the new sanctuary and worship, to symbolize the inviolable holiness of that sanctuary. The earlier sanctuary had nothing answering to this; and Kliefoth is wrong in supposing that the outer court served the same purpose in the tabernacle and Solomon's temple, whereas in the temple of Ezekiel this had also become part of the sanctuary, and was itself holy. The tabernacle had no outer court at all, and in Solomon's temple the outer court did form a component part of the sanctuary. The people might enter it, no doubt, when they desired to draw near to the Lord with sacrifices and gifts; but this continued to be the case in Ezekiel's temple, though with certain restrictions (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-10.htm">Ezekiel 46:10</a>). Only, in the case of Solomon's temple, the outer court bordered directly upon the common soil of the city and the land, so that the defilement of the land produced by the sin of the people could penetrate directly even into the holy space of the courts. In the sanctuary of the future, a safeguard was to be placed against this by the surrounding space which separated the holy from the common. It is true that the surface of Moriah supplied no room for this space of five hundred rods square; but the new temple was not to be built upon the real Moriah, but upon a very high mountain, which the Lord would exalt and make ready for the purpose when the temple was erected. Moreover, the circumstance that Moriah was much too small for the extent of the new temple and its surroundings, cannot furnish any argument against the correctness of our view of the verses in question, for the simple reason that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45.htm">Ezekiel 45</a> and 48 there follow still further statements concerning the separation of the sanctuary from the rest of the land, which are in perfect harmony with this, and show most indisputably that the temple seen by Ezekiel was not to have its seat in the ancient Jerusalem. </body></html>
