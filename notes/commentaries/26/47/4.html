Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The knees - The mission of Paul and Barnabas <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-4</a> is another marked epoch in the Church's history; and the time of Paul's martyrdom denotes an increase in the Gentile Church, which corresponds with the waters reaching the loins. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 47<p>Eze 47:1-23. Vision of the Temple Waters. Borders and Division of The land.<p>The happy fruit to the earth at large of God's dwelling with Israel in holy fellowship is that the blessing is no longer restricted to the one people and locality, but is to be diffused with comprehensive catholicity through the whole world. So the plant from the cedar of Lebanon is represented as gathering under its shelter "all fowl of every wing" (Eze 17:23). Even the desert places of the earth shall be made fruitful by the healing waters of the Gospel (compare Isa 35:1).<p>1. waters&#8212;So Re 22:1, represents "the water of life as proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb." His throne was set up in the temple at Jerusalem (Eze 43:7). Thence it is to flow over the earth (Joe 3:18; Zec 13:1; 14:8). Messiah is the temple and the door; from His pierced side flow the living waters, ever increasing, both in the individual believer and in the heart. The fountains in the vicinity of Moriah suggested the image here. The waters flow eastward, that is, towards the Kedron, and thence towards the Jordan, and so along the Ghor into the Dead Sea. The main point in the picture is the rapid augmentation from a petty stream into a mighty river, not by the influx of side streams, but by its own self-supply from the sacred miraculous source in the temple [Henderson]. (Compare Ps 36:8, 9; 46:4; Isa 11:9; Hab 2:14). Searching into the things of God, we find some easy to understand, as the water up to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters up to the knees or loins; others beyond our reach, of which we can only adore the depth (Ro 11:33). The healing of the waters of the Dead Sea here answers to "there shall be no more curse" (Re 22:3; compare Zec 14:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/47.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees,.... The man with his line measured another thousand cubits straight on from the first; and then bid the prophet cross and ford them again, and then they were knee deep: <p>again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins; a third time he measured a thousand cubits still onward, and ordered the prophet to wade through them, when they were risen so high as to reach his loins. The waters to the knees and loins may signify the greater knowledge of the Gospel, and the mysteries of it, the apostles had after the Spirit was poured forth; and the greater spread of it in the world, among Jews and Gentiles: or else may design those doctrines of the Gospel, and mysteries of grace, which are more sublime, and more difficult to understand; which require some pains to search into, and get the knowledge of; as concerning predestination, election, the covenant of grace, and the eternal transactions between the Father and the Son, &amp;c. which are meat for strong men, who have their senses exercised to discern between good and evil. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/47.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees.

Successive measurements shewed a depth to the knees, the loins, and finally an impassable river. The word rendered “river” is the usual one for “brook” or wady, viz. a stream with its valley or gorge.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - At a second and a third distance of a thousand cubits the same process was repeated when the waters were found to be first <span class="cmt_word">waters to the knees</span>, and secondly <span class="cmt_word">waters to</span> (or, of) <span class="cmt_word">the loins.</span> The unusual expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, instead <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, as in the similar expressions before and after, may have been chosen, Keil suggests, in order to avoid resemblance to the phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-12.htm">Isaiah 36:12</a> (Keri) - not a likely explanation.
