The reference which lies in the &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; to the classes of the priests and Levites, i.e., the priests and Levites divided into classes, does not presuppose their presence in the assembly.

The &#1500; before &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;-naadiyb, "are all freely willing with wisdom," in the middle of the sentence introducing the subject is strange; Bertheau would therefore strike it out, thinking that, as &#1500;&#1499;&#1500; goes immediately before, and follows immediately afterwards twice, &#1500;&#1499;&#1500; here may easily be an error for &#1499;&#1500;. This is certainly possible; but since this &#1500; is very frequently used in the Chronicle, it is a question whether it should not be regarded as authentic, "serving to bring into emphatic prominence the idea of the ndyb kl: with thee is for each business, what regards each willing person, for also all willing persons;" cf.
