What is the ground for this plaintive turn in the thought? Merely, it would seem, to emphasise what has just been said. We, as creatures of a day, can have no abiding and absolute possession. Our good things are lent to us for a season only. As our fathers passed away, so shall we.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_chronicles/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm" title="For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.">1 Chronicles 29:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">For we are strangers before thee, </span>&c. — Poor, despicable creatures. The land which we possess is thine, not ours; we are not the proprietors, but only thy tenants: and as our fathers once were mere strangers in it, even before men, so we at this day are no better before thee, having no absolute right in it, but only to travel through it, and sojourn in it for the short time we live in the world. This is equally true of all men, who on earth are but strangers and sojourners; while angels and saints in heaven are there at home. <span class="ital">Our days on earth are as a shadow — </span>David’s days had as much of substance in them as most men’s: for he was upon the whole a good man, a useful man, and now an old man. He lived long, and to good purpose; and yet he puts himself in the front of those who must acknowledge that their <span class="ital">days on the earth are as a shadow: </span>which speaks our life a vain life, a dark life, a transient life, and a life that will have its period, either in perfect light or perfect darkness. <span class="ital">And there is none abiding — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מקוה</span>, <span class="ital">mickve, expectation. </span>We cannot expect much from earth, nor can we expect any long continuance in it. This is mentioned here as that which forbids us to boast of what we give to God and his cause, or to our poor and destitute fellow-creatures, or of the services we perform to him. We only give what we must shortly leave, and what we cannot keep to ourselves: and our services are confined to a mere scantling of time: they are the services of a short, uncertain life. What, therefore, can we pretend to merit by such gifts or services? and what right have we to boast, or think highly of ourselves, on account of them? Surely God does us a great favour that he will accept such offerings and services from us.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:10-19 We cannot form a right idea of the magnificence of the temple, and the buildings around it, about which such quantities of gold and silver were employed. But the unsearchable riches of Christ exceed the splendour of the temple, infinitely more than that surpassed the meanest cottage on earth. Instead of boasting of these large oblations, David gave solemn thanks to the Lord. All they gave for the Lord's temple was his own; if they attempted to keep it, death would soon have removed them from it. They only use they could make of it to their real advantage, was, to consecrate it to the service of Him who gave it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The people rejoiced for that they offered willingly - i. e., the munificence of the princes and officers <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-6.htm">1 Chronicles 29:6</a> caused general joy among the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 29:10-25.

Wherefore David blessed the Lord&#8212;This beautiful thanksgiving prayer was the effusion overflowing with gratitude and delight at seeing the warm and widespread interest that was now taken in forwarding the favorite project of his life. Its piety is displayed in the fervor of devotional feeling&#8212;in the ascription of all worldly wealth and greatness to God as the giver, in tracing the general readiness in contributing to the influence of His grace, in praying for the continuance of this happy disposition among the people, and in solemnly and earnestly commending the young king and his kingdom to the care and blessing of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These words may contain a reason, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

In ancient states foreigners were sometimes allowed to reside in the capital under the immediate protection of the king or of the heads of the state; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/22-3.htm" title="And David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me....">1 Samuel 22:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-3.htm" title="And David dwelled with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.">1 Samuel 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-19.htm" title="Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with us? return to your place, and abide with the king: for you are a stranger, and also an exile.">2 Samuel 15:19</a>; cp. also the position of the aliens at Athens. David appeals to God on the ground that Israel is immediately under God’s protection. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-12.htm" title="Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with you, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.">Psalm 39:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">none abiding</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">no abiding</span>, i.e. no continuance.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Of the seven other clear occasions of occurrence of the word here translated <span class="cmt_word">abiding</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), it bears three times the meaning of "a gathering together" as of waters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-36.htm">Leviticus 11:36</a>). The other four times it is translated in the Authorized Version "hope," either in the abstract (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-2.htm">Ezra 10:2</a>), or in the personal object of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-7.htm">Jeremiah 50:7</a>).
