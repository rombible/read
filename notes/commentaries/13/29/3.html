The gold was "the gold of Ophir," then esteemed the purest and finest in the world (Job 22:24; 28:16; Isa 13:12).

In the second member of the verse, at the close of the enumeration, &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>, is again taken up, but with &#1500;, which Berth. rightly takes to be nota accus.: and (gave him) "the model of the chariot of the cherubim of gold, as spreading out (wings), and sheltering over the ark of the covenant of Jahve." &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; is not subordinated in the genitive to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, but is in explanatory apposition to it. The cherubim, not the ark, are the chariot upon which God enters or is throned; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>. The conception of the cherubim set upon the golden cover of the ark as &#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; is derived from the idea &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>. Ezekiel, it is true, saw wheels on the throne of God under the cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15</a>., 26), and in accordance with this the lxx and Vulg. have made a cherubim-chariot out of the words (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;, quadriga cherubim); but as against this Berth. rightly remarks, that the idea of a chariot of the cherubim does not at all appear in the two sculptured cherubim upon the ark, nor yet in our passage. &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; (without the article, and with &#1500;) Berth. thinks quite unintelligible, and would alter the text, reading &#1493;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1499;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, because the two participles should be in apposition to &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;. But this is an error; for neither by the meaning of the words, nor by the passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-8.htm">2 Chronicles 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a>, are we compelled to make this alteration. The two first-mentioned passages prove the opposite, viz., that these participles state for what purpose the cherubim are to serve. &#1493;&#1505;&#1499;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; have the signification of &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, "that the cherubim might be spreading wings and protecting" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>), as J. H. Mich. has rightly seen. This use of &#1500;, where in &#1500; even without a verb the idea of "becoming something" lies, but which Berth. does not understand, has been already discussed, Ew. 217, d, and illustrated by passages, among which <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-18.htm">1 Chronicles 28:18</a> is one. The reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a> explains also the use of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; without &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, the author of the Chronicle not thinking it necessary to give the object of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, as he might assume that that passage would be known to readers of his book.</body></html>
