David thanks God because his people are at one with him on the subject nearest his heart. Touching this fine utterance of a true inspiration, which the chronicler—or rather, perhaps, his authority—puts into the mouth of the aged king, we may remark that the spirit which found expression in the stirring odes of psalmists and the trumpet-tones of prophets in olden times, in the latter days, when psalmody was weak and prophecy dead, flowed forth in the new outlet of impassioned prayer.<p><span class= "bld">Before all.</span>—To <span class= "ital">the eyes of all</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-11.htm" title="No, my lord, hear me: the field give I you, and the cave that is therein, I give it you; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it you: bury your dead.">Genesis 23:11</a>), and frequently.<p><span class= "bld">Lord God of Israel our rather.</span>—The connection is “Israel our father,” not “Jehovah our father.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-18.htm" title="O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart to you:">1Chronicles 29:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-20.htm" title="And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God.

The fatherhood of God, though thus occasionally affirmed in prophetic writings, hardly became a ruling idea within the limits of Old Testament times.

The nearer we come to the land of everlasting praise, the more we should speak the language and do the work of that world. <span class="ital">Thine is the greatness and the power, </span>&c. — Thus David praises God with holy awe and reverence, acknowledging and adoring, 1st, His infinite perfections; not only that he is great, powerful, and glorious, &c., but that his is the greatness, power, and glory; that he has these perfections in and of himself, and is the centre and fountain of every thing that is excellent and blessed. 2d, His sovereign dominion, that he is the rightful owner and almighty possessor of all. <span class="ital">All that is in heaven and in earth is thine — </span>And at thy disposal, by the indisputable right of creation, and as Supreme Ruler and Commander of all. <span class="ital">Thine is the kingdom — </span>And all kings are thy subjects; <span class="ital">and thou art </span>to be <span class="ital">exalted </span>and worshipped <span class="ital">as head above all — </span>3d, His universal influence and agency. All that are rich and honourable among mankind have their riches and honours from God. This acknowledgment David would have the princes to take notice of, and join in, that they might not think they had merited any thing of God by their generosity; for from God they had had their riches and honour, and what they had returned to him was but a small part of what they had received from him. Whoever are great among men, it is God that makes them so; and whatever strength we have, it is God that gives it us. Let <span class="ital">no flesh, </span>then, <span class="ital">glory in his presence; for of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever!

But the unsearchable riches of Christ exceed the splendour of the temple, infinitely more than that surpassed the meanest cottage on earth. Instead of boasting of these large oblations, David gave solemn thanks to the Lord. All they gave for the Lord's temple was his own; if they attempted to keep it, death would soon have removed them from it. They only use they could make of it to their real advantage, was, to consecrate it to the service of Him who gave it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The people rejoiced for that they offered willingly - i. e., the munificence of the princes and officers <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-6.htm">1 Chronicles 29:6</a> caused general joy among the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 29:10-25.

Its piety is displayed in the fervor of devotional feeling&#8212;in the ascription of all worldly wealth and greatness to God as the giver, in tracing the general readiness in contributing to the influence of His grace, in praying for the continuance of this happy disposition among the people, and in solemnly and earnestly commending the young king and his kingdom to the care and blessing of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation,....

It includes adoration, acknowledgment of the inherent nature of human dependence, self-humiliation, and confession, dedication of all the offerings, and prayer both for the whole people in general, and for Solomon in particular, in view of his future position and responsibilities. Its utter repudiation of all idea of meritoriousness is very striking. The traces are visible of what may be called snatches of memory on the part of David from various religious odes of his own authorship, as well as from those of others still on record, as, for instance, especially in vers. 14-17, compared with passages in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89, </a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39.htm">Psalm 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144.htm">Psalm 144</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17.htm">Psalm 17</a>; and 139. But the unity of this service is abundantly conspicuous, and every sentence seems weighed and measured for the occasion. The scene, reaching its climax in what is recorded in ver. 20, must have been one of the utmost religious grandeur and impressiveness. It is true that the very last clause, which couples the reverence done on the part of the assembled multitude to the king, with that done to Jehovah himself, strikes us as an unfortunate conjunction. It does not, indeed, need upon its merits any vindication, considering the tenor of all which has preceded; but it may be felt an extenuation of the form in which the expression occurs, if we suppose (as we justly may) that the people viewed their act in the light of part of their religious service at that particular time. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-31.htm">1 Kings 1:31</a> the same words express the reverence paid to David, though in numerous other passages they mark that offered to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Gold 3000 talents, i.e., about 13 1/2, or, reckoning according to the royal shekel, 6 3/4 millions of pounds; 7000 talents of silver, circa 2 1/2 or 1 1/4 millions of pounds: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-14.htm">1 Chronicles 22:14</a>.
