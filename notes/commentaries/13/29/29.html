A uniform rendering for all might be found in the general word "history" or "acts." The question as to the probable nature of these works, and whether identical with our Books of Samuel, has been treated of in the Introduction. The Hebrew word for "seer," applied in this verse to Samuel, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. And that applied to Gad, though the Authorized Version has the same translation, "seer," is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. There can be no doubt that the word applied to Samuel would, under any circumstances, stand as the higher of the two names, were there any comparison intended between them. This is confirmed by the fact that it is found used only of him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9, 11, 18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-28.htm">1 Chronicles 26:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>) and of Hanani (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7, 10</a>), whereas the word applied to Gad in this verse is the <span class="accented">generic</span> name for seers, and is used several times in the Books of Chronicles of other persons than Gad. At the same time, the parenthesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>, to the effect that the word here used of Samuel as seer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) was superseded in later times (as, for instance, at the time of the writing of the Books of Samuel) by the word prophet (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>), compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>, points in a somewhat different direction. In the first place, it would indicate that our Authorized Version in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a> should rather stand, "Which say to the prophets, Prophesy not, and to the seers," etc. While for our present passage it would indicate that no insidious comparison is possible between Samuel and Gad as seers, but rather that Samuel retains the old honoured name by which he had been wont to be called, and that to <span class="accented">Nathan</span> is with equal naturalness attached the more modern name - the functions represented being essentially the same, or at least analogous. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Solomon's accession and David's death, with a statement as to the length of his reign and the sources of the history. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23-25</a>. The remarks on Solomon's accession and reign contained in these verses are necessary to the complete conclusion of a history of David's reign, for they show how David's wishes for his son Solomon, whom Jahve chose to be his successor, were fulfilled. On &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; see the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, he was prosperous, corresponds to the hope expressed by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-13.htm">1 Chronicles 22:13</a>), which was also fulfilled by the submission of all princes and heroes, and also of all the king's sons, to King Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-24.htm">1 Chronicles 29:24</a>). There can hardly, however, be in these last words a reference to the frustrating of Adonijah's attempted usurpation of the throne (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-15.htm">1 Kings 1:15</a>.). &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;  equals  to submit. But this meaning is not derived (Rashi) from the custom of taking oaths of fidelity by clasping of hands, for this custom cannot be certainly proved to have existed among the Israelites; still less can it have arisen from the ancient custom mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-9.htm">Genesis 24:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-29.htm">Genesis 47:29</a>, of laying the hand under the thigh of the person to whom one swore in making promises with oath. The hand, as the instrument of all activity, is here simply a symbol of power. </body></html>
