The Vulg. has the exegetical expansion, “dederunt manum et subjeeti fuerunt Salomoni regi.” The Hebrew phrase “put (<span class= "ital">nāthan</span>) hand under . . .” is not met with elsewhere. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-2.htm" title="And Abraham said to his oldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh:">Genesis 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-9.htm" title="And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.">Genesis 24:9</a>.) It appears to be different from “give hand to . . .” in token of good faith or submission. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-8.htm" title="Now be you not stiff necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.">2Chronicles 30:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-6.htm" title="We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.">Lamentations 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm" title="Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, see, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.">Ezekiel 17:18</a>.) An ancient mode of doing homage may be intended.

Though, by seniority, the title of David’s other sons to the crown was prior to that of Solomon, and they might think themselves wronged by his advancement; yet, because God was pleased to make him king, and had qualified him for that high office, they all submitted themselves to him, God doubtless inclining their hearts to do so, that Solomon’s reign might from the first be peaceable.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:20-25 This great assembly joined with David in adoring God.
