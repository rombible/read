The same words are used, in a somewhat different sense. about David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;">2Samuel 7:1</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-4.htm" title="But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil result.">1Kings 5:4</a> Solomon applies them to himself.

The Hebrew is <span class= "ital">Shĕlōmō;</span> for which the LXX. gives Sălōmōn; Syriac, Shĕleimûn; Arabic, Suleimân (same as “Solyman the Magnificent”). The original form of the word had the final <span class= "ital">n</span> which we see in the cognate languages. The Assyrian <span class= "ital">Shalman</span> (in Shalmaneser) and the Moabite Salamanu seem to be identical. The Vulg. has Pacificus (peace-maker). (Comp. the Greek Irenæeus, the German Friederich, our “Frederick,” peaceful.) Sŏlŏmon is the New Testament spelling.<p>It would seem that the original name of Solomon was Jedidiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm" title="And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.">2Samuel 12:25</a>), but posterity, looking back with fond regret to the palmy days of his reign, remembered him only as Shelomoh, “The Peaceful.” (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm" title="And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.">1Chronicles 20:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And I will give peace and</span> <span class= "bld">quietness unto Israel in</span> <span class= "bld">his days.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">and peace and quietness will I put upon Israel,</span> &c.

Because God named him. Nothing is more powerful to engage us in any service for God, than to know that we are appointed thereto. Because he would have leisure and opportunity to do it. He should have peace and quietness. Where God gives rest, he expects work. Because God had promised to establish his kingdom. God's gracious promises should quicken and strengthen our religious service. David delivered to Solomon an account of the vast preparations he had made for this building; not from pride and vain-glory, but to encourage Solomon to engage cheerfully in the great work. He must not think, by building the temple, to purchase a dispensation to sin; on the contrary, his doing that would not be accepted, if he did not take heed to fulfil the statutes of the Lord. In our spiritual work, as well as in our spiritual warfare, we have need of courage and resolution.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the names of Solomon, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a> note.

He unfolded his great and long cherished plan, enjoined the building of God's house as a sacred duty on him as his son and successor, and described the resources that were at command for carrying on the work. The vast amount of personal property he had accumulated in the precious metals [1Ch 22:14] must have been spoil taken from the people he had conquered, and the cities he had sacked.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, a son shall be born to thee,....

The promise here made is of a period of peace sufficiently long for the work of Temple-building.
