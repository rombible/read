They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From this passage and from the subsequent account of the Manassites <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23-24</a>, the Gadites extended themselves to the north at the expense of their brethren, gradually occupying a considerable portion of the tract originally allotted to the "half tribe." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 5:11-26.

"His (i.e., Beerah's) brothers" are the families related to the family of Beerah, which were descended from the brothers of Joel. That they were not, however, properly "brothers," is clear from the fact that Bela's descent is traced back to Joel as the third of the preceding members of his family; and the conclusion would be the same, even if this Joel be another than the one mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-4.htm">1 Chronicles 5:4</a>. The singular suffix with &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; is to be taken distributively or &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; may be supplied before it in thought; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-34.htm">Numbers 2:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-10.htm">Numbers 11:10</a>. The word &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, "head," for the first-born, stands here before the name, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-3.htm">1 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-8.htm">1 Chronicles 23:8</a>; elsewhere it stands after the name, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>.

"Until Nebo and Baal-meon" westward. Nebo, a village on the hill of the same name in the mountains of Abarim, opposite Jericho (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>). Baal-meon is probably identical with the ruin Myun, three-quarters of an hour south-east from Heshbon. </body></html>
