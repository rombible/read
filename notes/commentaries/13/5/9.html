This desert was a painful memory to the restored exiles. Ezra took four months to cross it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm" title="For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.">Ezra 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-22.htm" title="For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is on all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.">Ezra 8:22</a>).

They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He inhabited - i. e.

Reuben is called the first-born of Israel, because he was the first-born of Jacob, although, owing to his having defiled his father's bed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), his birthright, i.e., its privileges, were transferred to the sons of Joseph, who were not, however, entered in the family register of the house of Israel according to the birthright, i.e., as first-born sons. The inf. &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; with &#1500; expresses "shall" or "must," cf. Ew. 237, e., "he was not to register," i.e., "he was not to be registered." The subject is Joseph, as the Rabbins, e.g., Kimchi, have perceived. The clauses after &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; form a parenthesis, containing the reason of Reuben's being called &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;, which is still further established by its being shown (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-2.htm">1 Chronicles 5:2</a>) how it happened that Joseph, although the birthright was given to him, according to the disposition made by the patriarch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>.), yet was not entered in the family registers as first-born. The reason of this was, "for Judah was strong among his brethren, and (one) from him became the Prince;" scil. on the strength of the patriarchal blessing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>), and by means of the historic fulfilment of this blessing. The "prevailing" of Judah among his brethren showed itself even under Moses at the numbering of the people, when the tribe of Judah considerably outnumbered all the other tribes (cf. t. i. 2, S. 192). Then, again, it appeared after the division of the land of Canaan among the tribes of Israel, Judah being called by a declaration of the divine will to be the vanguard of the army in the war against the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>.); and it was finally made manifest by the &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; over Israel being chosen by God from the tribe of Judah, in the person of David (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-4.htm">1 Chronicles 28:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-30.htm">1 Samuel 25:30</a>). From this we gather that the short, and from its brevity obscure, sentence &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; bears the signification we have given it. "But the birthright was Joseph's;" i.e., the rights of the progenitor were transferred to or remained with him, for two tribal domains were assigned to his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh, according to the law of the first-born (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>).<p>After this parenthetic explanation, the words "the sons of Reuben, the first-born of Israel," <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>, are again taken up in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-3.htm">1 Chronicles 5:3</a>, and the sons are enumerated. The names of the four sons correspond to those given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5-7</a>. </body></html>
