Zechariah and Bela were heads of the other chief houses.

They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed.

The Line of Reuben.<p>1. Now the sons of Reuben&#8212;In proceeding to give this genealogy, the sacred historian states, in a parenthesis (1Ch 5:1, 2), the reason why it was not placed first, as Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob. The birthright, which by a foul crime he had forfeited, implied not only dominion, but a double portion (De 21:17); and both of these were transferred to Joseph, whose two sons having been adopted as the children of Jacob (Ge 48:5), received each an allotted portion, as forming two distinct tribes in Israel. Joseph then was entitled to the precedency; and yet, as his posterity was not mentioned first, the sacred historian judged it necessary to explain that "the genealogy was not to be reckoned after the birthright," but with a reference to a superior honor and privilege that had been conferred on Judah&#8212;not the man, but the tribe, whereby it was invested with the pre-eminence over all the other tribes, and out of it was to spring David with his royal lineage, and especially the great Messiah (Heb 7:14). These were the two reasons why, in the order of enumeration, the genealogy of Judah is introduced before that of Reuben.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His brethren, </span> i.e. the other sons of Reuben, and their posterity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The chief, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the head</span>; each was the head of his family. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his brethren by their families,....

There is little doubt that Burckhardt has identified the ruins of <span class="cmt_word">Aroer</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24, 36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8, 12, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-1.htm">Joshua 12:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13, 26</a>, where note transposition of letters in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>).

This Nebo, the <span class="accented">town</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> distinct from Mount Nebo. It is remarkable that it is not mentioned, unless under one of the "changed" names (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>), in the list of the towns of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15-23</a>). Nebo was the name of a heathen deity, known among the Chaldeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), Babylonians, and Assyrians; and this constituted one reason, if not the reason, for changing its name when it had been affixed to the Moabite city. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The families of the tribe of Reuben. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-2.htm">1 Chronicles 5:2</a>. Reuben is called the first-born of Israel, because he was the first-born of Jacob, although, owing to his having defiled his father's bed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), his birthright, i.e., its privileges, were transferred to the sons of Joseph, who were not, however, entered in the family register of the house of Israel according to the birthright, i.e., as first-born sons. The inf. &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; with &#1500; expresses "shall" or "must," cf. Ew. 237, e., "he was not to register," i.e., "he was not to be registered." The subject is Joseph, as the Rabbins, e.g., Kimchi, have perceived. The clauses after &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; form a parenthesis, containing the reason of Reuben's being called &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;, which is still further established by its being shown (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-2.htm">1 Chronicles 5:2</a>) how it happened that Joseph, although the birthright was given to him, according to the disposition made by the patriarch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>.), yet was not entered in the family registers as first-born. The reason of this was, "for Judah was strong among his brethren, and (one) from him became the Prince;" scil. on the strength of the patriarchal blessing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>), and by means of the historic fulfilment of this blessing. The "prevailing" of Judah among his brethren showed itself even under Moses at the numbering of the people, when the tribe of Judah considerably outnumbered all the other tribes (cf. t. i. 2, S. 192). Then, again, it appeared after the division of the land of Canaan among the tribes of Israel, Judah being called by a declaration of the divine will to be the vanguard of the army in the war against the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>.); and it was finally made manifest by the &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; over Israel being chosen by God from the tribe of Judah, in the person of David (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-4.htm">1 Chronicles 28:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-30.htm">1 Samuel 25:30</a>). From this we gather that the short, and from its brevity obscure, sentence &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; bears the signification we have given it. "But the birthright was Joseph's;" i.e., the rights of the progenitor were transferred to or remained with him, for two tribal domains were assigned to his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh, according to the law of the first-born (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>).<p>After this parenthetic explanation, the words "the sons of Reuben, the first-born of Israel," <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>, are again taken up in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-3.htm">1 Chronicles 5:3</a>, and the sons are enumerated. The names of the four sons correspond to those given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5-7</a>. </body></html>
