They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sons of Joel - The line of succession here given must be broken by one great gap or several smaller ones, since nine generations before Tiglath-pileser would carry us back no further than the reign of Rehoboam. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 5<p>1Ch 5:1-10. The Line of Reuben.<p>1. Now the sons of Reuben&#8212;In proceeding to give this genealogy, the sacred historian states, in a parenthesis (1Ch 5:1, 2), the reason why it was not placed first, as Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob. The birthright, which by a foul crime he had forfeited, implied not only dominion, but a double portion (De 21:17); and both of these were transferred to Joseph, whose two sons having been adopted as the children of Jacob (Ge 48:5), received each an allotted portion, as forming two distinct tribes in Israel. Joseph then was entitled to the precedency; and yet, as his posterity was not mentioned first, the sacred historian judged it necessary to explain that "the genealogy was not to be reckoned after the birthright," but with a reference to a superior honor and privilege that had been conferred on Judah&#8212;not the man, but the tribe, whereby it was invested with the pre-eminence over all the other tribes, and out of it was to spring David with his royal lineage, and especially the great Messiah (Heb 7:14). These were the two reasons why, in the order of enumeration, the genealogy of Judah is introduced before that of Reuben.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The sons of Joel,.... Who was either the son of Carmi last mentioned, or rather of Hanoch, Reuben's firstborn, since the descendants of him were the princes of the tribe: his posterity in succession were, Shemaiah, Cog, Shimei, Micah, Reaia, Baal, Beerah; of whom we know no more than their names, and by these the descent is carried down to the captivity by Tiglathpileser, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A part of the Simeonites undertook a second war of conquest against Mount Seir. Led by four chiefs of the sons of Shimei (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a>), 500 men marched thither, smote the remainder of the Amalekites who had escaped, and they dwell there to this day (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41</a>). &#1502;&#1492;&#1501; is more accurately defined by &#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and is therefore to be referred to the Simeonites in general, and not to that part of them only mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-33.htm">1 Chronicles 4:33</a> (Berth.). From the circumstance that the leaders were sons of Shimei, we may conclude that the whole troop belonged to this family. The escaped of Amalek are those who had escaped destruction in the victories of Saul and David over this hereditary enemy of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>). A remnant of them had been driven into the mountain land of Idumea, where they were smitten, i.e., extirpated, by the Simeonites. It is not said at what time this was done, but it occurred most probably in the second half of Hezekiah's reign. </body></html>
