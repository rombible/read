They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jetur no doubt gave his name to the important tribe of the Ituraeans who inhabited the region southwest of the Damascene plain, between Gaulonitis (Jaulan) and the Ledjah. This tribe was noted for its thievish habits, and was regarded as savage and warlike. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-22. Hagarites&#8212;or, "Hagarenes," originally synonymous with "Ishmaelites," but afterwards applied to a particular tribe of the Arabs (compare Ps 83:6).<p>Jetur&#8212;His descendants were called Itureans, and the country Auranitis, from Hauran, its chief city. These, who were skilled in archery, were invaded in the time of Joshua by a confederate army of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, who, probably incensed by the frequent raids of those marauding neighbors, took reprisals in men and cattle, dispossessed almost all of the original inhabitants, and colonized the district themselves. Divine Providence favoured, in a remarkable manner, the Hebrew army in this just war.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. With the posterity of Jetur, &c., who were Ishmeelites, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-15.htm" title="Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:">Genesis 25:15</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they made war with the Hagarites,....

It would be possible to consider them here as <span class="accented">in apposition</span> with the description, <span class="cmt_word">the Hagarites</span> (respecting whom see note on ver. 10); but they may more probably be regarded as favourite names, still repeated in the descendants of the tribe. The people of Nephish have not made their mark deep on the page of ethnographic history; but the people of Jetur have done so. Their stinted territory appears in the name Ituraea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>). Their people reappear also (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13. e. 11, &sect; 3; Strabo, 16:518, 520). Nor is it an unnoticeable contribution to the truth of our history here to put, side by side with the description of the qualities and of the arms and weapons of warfare of the Manassites and their helpers of Reuben and Gad (ver. 18), those of the Ituraeans, their antagonists (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:448; Cicero, 'Philippians,' 2:44; Luean, 'Pharsalia,' 7:230; see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:905). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sons of Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-16.htm">Genesis 46:16</a>) are not named here, because the enumeration of the families of Gad had been already introduced by <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-11.htm">1 Chronicles 5:11</a>, and the genealogical connection of the families enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a>., with the sons of the tribal ancestor, had not been handed down. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a> four names are mentioned, which are clearly those of heads of families or fathers'-houses, with the addition "in Bashan," i.e., dwelling, for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is to be repeated or supplied from the preceding verse. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-13.htm">1 Chronicles 5:13</a> seven other names occur, the bearers of which are introduced as brothers of those mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a>), according to their fathers'-houses. They are therefore heads of fathers'-houses, but the district in which they dwelt is not given; whence Bertheau concludes, but wrongly, that the place where they dwelt is not given in the text. The statement which is here omitted follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a> at a fitting place; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-14.htm">1 Chronicles 5:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-15.htm">1 Chronicles 5:15</a> their genealogy, which rightly goes before the mention of their dwelling-place, is given. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-14.htm">1 Chronicles 5:14</a>, is not to be referred, as Bertheau thinks, to the four Gadites mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-13.htm">1 Chronicles 5:13</a>, but only to those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-13.htm">1 Chronicles 5:13</a>. Nothing more was known of those four (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a>) but that they dwelt in Bashan, while the genealogy of the seven is traced up through eight generations to a certain Buz, of whom nothing further is known, as the name &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; occurs nowhere else, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a> as that of a son of Nahor. The names of his ancestors also are not found elsewhere among the Gadites.</body></html>
