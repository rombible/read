The line of Joel is traced through seven generations to Beerah, who was transported to Assyria by Tiglath Pileser. II., 734 B.C., in the reign of Pekah, king of Israel. Supposing there are no gaps in the series, Joel flourished 280 years (7 x 40) before that date; that is, about 1014 B.C., under David and Solomon.<p>(4) The LXX. read: “Sons of Joel Shemaiah, and Banaia (Benaiah) his son; and sons of Gog, son of Shemaiah, his son Micah,” &c.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-26 Genealogies. - This chapter gives some account of the two tribes and a half seated on the east side of Jordan. They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sons of Joel - The line of succession here given must be broken by one great gap or several smaller ones, since nine generations before Tiglath-pileser would carry us back no further than the reign of Rehoboam. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 5<p>1Ch 5:1-10. The Line of Reuben.<p>1. Now the sons of Reuben&#8212;In proceeding to give this genealogy, the sacred historian states, in a parenthesis (1Ch 5:1, 2), the reason why it was not placed first, as Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob. The birthright, which by a foul crime he had forfeited, implied not only dominion, but a double portion (De 21:17); and both of these were transferred to Joseph, whose two sons having been adopted as the children of Jacob (Ge 48:5), received each an allotted portion, as forming two distinct tribes in Israel. Joseph then was entitled to the precedency; and yet, as his posterity was not mentioned first, the sacred historian judged it necessary to explain that "the genealogy was not to be reckoned after the birthright," but with a reference to a superior honor and privilege that had been conferred on Judah&#8212;not the man, but the tribe, whereby it was invested with the pre-eminence over all the other tribes, and out of it was to spring David with his royal lineage, and especially the great Messiah (Heb 7:14). These were the two reasons why, in the order of enumeration, the genealogy of Judah is introduced before that of Reuben.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Joel</span> was the son either of Carmi last mentioned; or rather of Hanoch, Reuben’s first-born, because he and his were successively princes of this tribe, as may be gathered from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-6.htm" title="Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.">1 Chronicles 5:6</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The sons of Joel,....

Juntas and Tremellius say Hanoch, others Carmi, while the Syriac Version has Carrot <span class="accented">vice</span> Joel. It is to be remarked that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-8.htm">Numbers 26:8-10</a> a line of descent through <span class="accented">Pallu</span> is given, but reaching only to the second generation, <span class="cmt_word">Beerah</span> in the present list will be only ninth at furthest from Reuben, so that it is evident that it is a very fragmentary genealogy, whether the hiatus be only one, viz. between Reuben's son (whichever it may be in question) and Joel, or whether both there and elsewhere also. Of none of the eight persons beginning with Joel and ending with Beerah is anything else known, unless either <span class="cmt_word">Shemaiah</span> or <span class="cmt_word">Shimei</span> may be identical with the Shema of ver. 8, in which case it might be also that the Joel of ver. 8 is identical with that of ver. 4. In this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a> <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span> appears as the name of a <span class="accented">man.</span> In this passage, and in ver. 26 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20</a>, we have a different form in each part of the word, of the <span class="accented">Tiglath-pileser</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>. These slight differences in the position of the radicals, with the introduction or omission of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, make as many as four different readings in the Hebrew. Tiglath-pileser, the second Assyrian king who came into conflict with the Israelites, reigned <span class="accented">about</span>  <span class="date">B.C. 747-727</span>. Gesenius thinks that the former half of the word is the same as <span class="accented">Diglath</span>, i.q. Tigris; and that the latter, a root occurring also in the name <span class="accented">Nabo-pola-saris</span>, is from an Assyrian verb meaning "to guard." He translates the word as "Lord of the Tigris." The Assyrian reproduction of the name is <span class="accented">Tigulti-pal-tsira</span> (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), or <span class="accented">Tukulti-pal-zara</span> ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The Captivity is spoken of further in the last verse of this chapter and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27-31</a>. The Septuagint reads vers. 4 and 5 differently: "The sons of Joel, Semei and Banaea his son; and the sons of Gog the son of <span class="accented">Semei</span>," etc., and this in all three editions - Vatican, Alexandrine, and Aldine. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The above-mentioned Simeonite princes, with their people, fell upon the peaceful little people of the Hamites in the days of Hezekiah, and smote, i.e., destroyed, their tents, and also the Meunites whom they found there. The Meunites were strangers in this place, and were probably connected with the city Maan in the neighbourhood of Petra, to the east of Wady Musa (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-7.htm">2 Chronicles 26:7</a>), who dwelt in tents as nomads, with the Hamites in their richly pastured valley. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1502;&#1501;, and they destroyed them utterly, as the Vulgate rightly renders it, et deleverunt; and J. H. Mich., ad internecionem usque eos exciderunt. The word &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, to smite with the curse, having gradually lost its original religious signification, came to be used in a wider sense, to denote complete extirpation, because all accursed persons were slain. Undoubted examples are <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-14.htm">2 Chronicles 32:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-11.htm">2 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-11.htm">Isaiah 37:11</a>; and it is to be so understood here also.<p>(Note: Bertheau ignores this secondary use of the word, and has drawn from &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1502;&#1501; the extremely wide inference, that the Simeonites, impelled by holy enthusiasm, arising from the wondrous deliverance of Judah from the attack of the Assyrian power, and the elevation of feeling which it produced in the community, and filled with the thought awakened by the discourses of the great prophets, that the time had come to extend Israel's rule, and to bring the conquered peoples under the curse, just as was done in the time of Joshua, had undertaken this war of annexation. But there is unfortunately not a single trace of this enthusiastic thought in the narrative of our verse, for it knows no other motive for the whole undertaking than the purely earthly need to seek and find new pasture lands.)<p>"Until this day," i.e., till the composition of the historical work used by the author of the Chronicle, i.e., till the time before the exile. </body></html>
