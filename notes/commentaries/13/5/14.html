They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From this passage and from the subsequent account of the Manassites <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23-24</a>, the Gadites extended themselves to the north at the expense of their brethren, gradually occupying a considerable portion of the tract originally allotted to the "half tribe." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 5:11-26.

The translators of the Septuagint saw that the two verses composed one line of ascent, but instead of piecing "Aki" to "Buz," translated it as" brother." Though this line takes us some way back, we find nowhere else any clue or identification of any of these ten persons. Of the twenty-one persons in all, therefore, named as belonging to the tribe of Gad, nothing else is known; and we have nothing to guide us to connect them with any one rather than another of the original" sons of Gad" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-16.htm">Genesis 46:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15-18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And his brothers," (each) according to his families in the registration, according to their descent (properly their generations; vide for &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>), are (were) the head (the first) Jeiel and Zechariah, and Bela, ... the son of Joel," probably the Joel already mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-4.htm">1 Chronicles 5:4</a>. "His (i.e., Beerah's) brothers" are the families related to the family of Beerah, which were descended from the brothers of Joel. That they were not, however, properly "brothers," is clear from the fact that Bela's descent is traced back to Joel as the third of the preceding members of his family; and the conclusion would be the same, even if this Joel be another than the one mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-4.htm">1 Chronicles 5:4</a>. The singular suffix with &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; is to be taken distributively or &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; may be supplied before it in thought; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-34.htm">Numbers 2:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-10.htm">Numbers 11:10</a>. The word &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, "head," for the first-born, stands here before the name, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-3.htm">1 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-8.htm">1 Chronicles 23:8</a>; elsewhere it stands after the name, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>. The dwelling-places of Bela and his family are then given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-8.htm">1 Chronicles 5:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-9.htm">1 Chronicles 5:9</a>. "He dwelt in Aroer," on the banks of the brook Arnon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>), now the ruin Araayr on the northern bank of the Mojeb (vide on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>). "Until Nebo and Baal-meon" westward. Nebo, a village on the hill of the same name in the mountains of Abarim, opposite Jericho (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>). Baal-meon is probably identical with the ruin Myun, three-quarters of an hour south-east from Heshbon. </body></html>
