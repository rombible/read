See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Some prefer, "And let Thy name be established and magnified forever:" i. e., "Let not only Thy promise stand firm, but let Thy Name also stand firm (continue to be held in honor) and be magnified," etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

But the word &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; remains obscure in any case, for elsewhere it occurs only as a substantive, in the significations, "the act of going up" (or drawing up) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>), "that which goes up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-5.htm">Ezekiel 11:5</a>), "the step;" while for the signification "height" (locus superior) only this passage is adduced by Gesenius in Thes. But even had the word this signification, the word &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; could not signify in loco excelso  equals  in coelis in its present connection; and further, even were this possible, the translation et me intuitus es more hominum in coelis gives no tolerable sense. But neither can &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; be the vocative of address, and a predicate of God, "Thou height, Jahve God," as Hgstb. Christol. i. p. 378 trans., takes it, with many older commentators. The passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-9.htm">Psalm 92:9</a>, "Thou art &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, height, sublimity for ever, Jahve," is not sufficient to prove that in our verse &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is predicated of God. Without doubt, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; should go with &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;, and appears to correspond to the &#1500;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; of the preceding clause, in the signification: as regards the elevation, in reference to the going upwards, i.e., the exaltation of my race (seed) on high. The thought would then be this: After the manner of men, so condescendingly and graciously, as men have intercourse with each other, hast Thou looked upon or visited me in reference to the elevation of myself or my race, - the text of the Chronicle giving an explanation of the parallel narrative.<p>(Note: This interpretation of this extremely difficult word corresponds in sense to the not less obscure words in 2nd Samuel, and gives us, with any alteration of the text, a more fitting thought than the alterations in the reading proposed by the moderns. Ewald and Berth. would alter &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; into &#1493;&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; (hiph.), and &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; into &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, in order to get the meaning, "Thou hast caused me to see like the series of men upwards," i.e., the line of men who stretch from David outward into the far future in unbroken series, which Thenius rightly calls a thoroughly modern idea. Bttcher's attempt at explanation is much more artificial. He proposes, in N. k. Aehrenlese, iii. S. 225, to read &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;...&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;, and translates: "so that I saw myself, as the series of men who follow upwards shall see me, i.e., so that I could see myself as posterity will see me, at the head of a continuous family of rulers:" where the main idea has to be supplied.)<p>The divergence in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-18.htm">1 Chronicles 17:18</a>, &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; instead of &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-20.htm">2 Samuel 7:20</a>), which cannot be an explanation or interpretation of Samuel's text, is less difficult of explanation. The words in Samuel, "What can David say more unto Thee?" have in this connection the very easily understood signification, What more can I say of the promise given me? and needed no explanation. When, instead of this, we read in the Chronicle, "What more can Thy servant add to Thee in regard to the honour to Thy servant?" an unprejudiced criticism must hold this text for the original, because it is the more difficult. It is the more difficult, not only on account of the omission of &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, which indeed is not absolutely necessary, though serving to explain &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;, but mainly on account of the unusual construction of the nomen &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; with &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498;, honour towards Thy servant. The construction &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514; &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is not quite analogous, for &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; is not a nomen actionis like &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470; &#1499;&#1489;&#1491; is rather connected with the practice which begins to obtain in the later language of employing &#1488;&#1514; as a general casus obliquus, instead of any more definite preposition (Ew. 277, d, S. 683f., der 7 Aufl.), and is to be translated: "honour concerning Thy servant." The assertion that &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; is to be erased as a later gloss which has crept into the text, cuts the knots, but does not untie them. That the lxx have not these words, only proves that these translators did not know what to make of them, and so just omitted them, as they have omitted the first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a> also there is no valid ground for altering the &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; of the Chronicle to make it correspond to &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in Samuel; for the words, "for Thy servant's sake," i.e., because Thou hast chosen Thy servant, give a quite suitable sense; cf. the discussion on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-21.htm">2 Samuel 7:21</a>. In the second half of the verse, however, the more extended phrases of 2nd Samuel are greatly contracted. </body></html>
