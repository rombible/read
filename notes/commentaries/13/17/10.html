The allusion is to the oppressions undergone in the period of the judges, and the troubles of the former reign.<p><span class= "bld">Moreover </span>(and)<span class= "bld"> I will subdue all thine enemies.</span>—A continuation of the promises at the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-9.htm" title="Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,">1Chronicles 17:9</a>. “I will subdue the foes of the king, as I subdued the foes of the shepherd and the outlaw.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-8.htm" title="And I have been with you wherever you have walked, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.">1Chronicles 17:8</a>.) Instead of this, Samuel has, “And I will give thee rest from all thy enemies.”<p><span class= "bld">Furthermore I tell thee</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">And I have told thee, and a house will Jehovah build thee;”</span> that is, I have foretold it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-21.htm" title="Have you not known? have you not heard? has it not been told you from the beginning? have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?">Isaiah 40:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-21.htm" title="Tell you, and bring them near; yes, let them take counsel together: who has declared this from ancient time? who has told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Savior; there is none beside me.">Isaiah 45:21</a>.) That which follows is a sort of ironical inversion of David’s wish to build a house for the Lord. The term “house” is figurative (offspring), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-1.htm" title="Except the LORD build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman wakes but in vain.">Psalm 127:1</a>.

The reading of Samuel is, “And Jehovah hath [now] told thee [by my mouth] that a house will Jehovah make for thee.” This looks original, with its rare construction of the perfect, which the chronicler has altered; its repetition of the most holy Name; and its less exact “make,” which Chronicles improves into “build,” with an eye to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-4.htm" title="Go and tell David my servant, Thus said the LORD, You shall not build me an house to dwell in:">1Chronicles 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-6.htm" title="Wherever I have walked with all Israel, spoke I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have you not built me an house of cedars?">1Chronicles 17:6</a>, as well as to the play on the word (<span class= "ital">bānāh,</span> build; <span class= "ital">bānîm,</span> sons).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_chronicles/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-10.htm" title="And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel.

See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare throughout <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> and the notes found there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. at the beginning, and since the time that I commanded judges&#8212;that is, including the whole period from Joshua to Saul.<p>I tell thee that the Lord will build thee an house&#8212;This was the language of Nathan himself, who was specially directed to assure David, not only of personal blessing and prosperity, but of a continuous line of royal descendants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel.

Our account of this design of David's, with its results for him and for his kingdom, is in all essential points identical with the parallel account, so that we may refer to the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> for any necessary explanation of the matter. The difference between the two narratives are in great part of a merely formal kind; the author of the Chronicle having sought to make the narrative more intelligible to his contemporaries, partly by using later phrases current in his own time, such as &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; for &#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;, partly by simplifying and explaining the bolder and more obscure expressions. Very seldom do we find divergences in the subject-matter which alter the meaning or make it appear to be different. To supplement and complete the commentary already given in 2nd Samuel, we will now shortly treat of these divergences. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1</a>, the statement that David communicated his purpose to build a temple to the Lord to the prophet Nathan, "when Jahve had given him rest from all his enemies round about," is wanting. This clause, which fixes the time, has been omitted by the chronicler to avoid the apparent contradiction which would have arisen in case the narrative were taken chronologically, seeing that the greatest of David's wars, those against the Philistines, Syrians, and Ammonites, are narrated only in the succeeding chapter. As to this, cf. the discussion on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-3</a>. </body></html>
