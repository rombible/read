See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The marginal rendering is preferable. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

This explanation, however, does not justify us in supposing that &#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; has been dropped out of the Chronicle. The words &#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; are either to be subordinated in a loose connection to the clause, to define the way in which God has made Himself a name (cf. Ew. 283), or connected with &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; in a pregnant sense: "to make Thee a name, (doing) great and fearful things." But, on the other hand, the converse expression in Samuel, "fearful things for Thy land, before Thy people which Thou redeemedst to Thee from Egypt (from) the nations and their gods," is explained in Chronicles by the interpolation of &#1500;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;: "fearful things, to drive out before Thy people, which ... nations." The divergences cannot be explained by the hypothesis that both texts are mutilated, as is sufficiently shown by the contradictions into which Thenius and Bertheau have fallen in their attempts so to explain them.<p>All the remaining divergences of one text from the other are only variations of the expression, such as involuntarily arise in the endeavour to give a clear and intelligible narrative, without making a literal copy of the authority made use of. Among these we include even &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, "Thy servant hath found to pray" (1 Chr. , as compared with &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, "Thy servant hath found his heart," i.e., found courage, to pray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-28.htm">2 Samuel 7:28</a>); where it is impossible to decide whether the author of the books of Samuel has added &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; as an explanation, or the author of the Chronicle has omitted it because the phrase "to find his heart" occurs only in this single passage of the Old Testament. &#1500;&#1492;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; signifies, Thy servant has reached the point of directing this prayer to Thee. </body></html>
