See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare throughout <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> and the notes found there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 17<p>1Ch 17:1-10.

The date was towards the latter end of David's reign, for it is expressly said in the former book to have been at the cessation of all his wars. But as to narrate the preparations for the removal of the ark and the erection of the temple was the principal object of the historian, the exact chronology is not followed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Nathan said unto David, Do <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for God <i>is</i> with thee.</span><p>(c) As yet God had not revealed to the prophet what he purposed concerning David, therefore seeing God favoured David, he spoke what he thought.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">in thine heart</span>] The heart according to Heb. thought is the seat of intention and purpose.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse gives Nathan's response on the spur of the moment. And that it was not radically wrong from a prophet may be inferred from the stress afterwards laid upon the acceptableness to God of what had been in the heart of David to do. Even with God, silence would sometimes be understood by a prophet to be equivalent to assent. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1510;&#1491;&#1493;&#1511; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; is still dependent on the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-37.htm">1 Chronicles 16:37</a>. The priest Zadok with his brethren he left before the tent of Jahve, i.e., the tabernacle at the Bamah in Gibeon. For &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-13.htm">2 Chronicles 1:13</a>, and for Zadok on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-12.htm">2 Chronicles 6:12</a>. It is surprising here that no priest is named as superintendent or overseer of the sacrificial worship in the tent of the ark of the covenant. But the omission is accounted for by the fact that our chapter treats properly only of the arrangement of the sacred music connected with the worship, and Zadok is mentioned as overseer of the sanctuary of the tabernacle at Gibeon only in order to introduce the statement as to the Levitic singers and players assigned to that sanctuary. Without doubt Abiathar as high priest had the oversight of the sacrificial worship in the sanctuary of the tabernacle: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-40.htm">1 Chronicles 16:40</a> cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-6.htm">Numbers 28:6</a>. &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; corresponds to &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;: and in reference to all, i.e., to look after all, which was written. This refers not only to the bringing of the sacrifices prescribed, in addition to the daily burnt-offering, but in general to everything that it was the priests' duty to do in the sanctuary.</body></html>
