A select number of the musicians were chosen for the service from the list (1Ch 15:19-21) of those who had taken a prominent part in the recent procession. The same arrangement was to be observed in their duties, now that the ark again was stationary; Asaph, with his associates, composing the first or principal company, played with cymbals; Zechariah and his colleagues, with whom were conjoined Jeiel and Obed-edom, forming the second company, used harps and similar instruments.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord,....

The verse seems to describe what should be the essence of that service. It was threefold - <span class="cmt_word">to record, to thank</span>, and to praise the Lord God of Israel. The word here used for "record" is the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (to remember), and is remarked upon by Gesenius as a title strictly appropriate to the character of the two psalms Psalms 38 and Psalms 70, on the head of which it stands, as meaning, "to make others remember" (see also such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-26.htm">Isaiah 43:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>). The minds of the people were to be refreshed in this service and in their very psalm of praise (so note in this sense vers. 8, 9, 12, 21, etc.), by being reminded or told, so far as the youngest of them might be concerned, of God's marvellous and merciful deeds for their forefathers of many, many a generation. Then they were to give intelligent and hearty thanks. And, lastly, they were to offer to approach that purest form of worship which consists in adoring praise. One might imagine with what zest they would have accepted, with what fervour they would have added lip and instrument of music to it - that one verse which needed the revolution yet of nearly another three thousand years, that it might flow from the devotion or' Addison. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When all thy mercies, O my God,<br />My rising soul surveys,<br />Transported with the view I'm lost<br />In wonder, love, and praise."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The discrepancy between <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-27.htm">1 Chronicles 15:27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a> is more difficult of explanation. Instead of the words &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1494; &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;, David danced with all his might before Jahve, we read in the Chronicle &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500; &#1491;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;, David was clothed with a robe of byssus. But since &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1499;&#1512; differs from &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500; only in the last two letters, and &#1499;&#1512; might be easily exchanged for &#1489;&#1500;, we may suppose that &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500; has arisen out of &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1499;&#1512;. Bertheau accordingly says: "Any one who remembered that in this verse David's clothing was spoken of might write &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1499;&#1512; as &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500;, while the words &#1506;&#1494; &#1489;&#1499;&#1500;, which were probably illegible,were conjecture to be &#1489;&#1493;&#1509; &#1489;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500;." This opinion would be worthy of consideration, if only the other discrepancies between the Chronicle and Samuel were thereby made more comprehensible. That, besides David, the bearers of the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah are mentioned, Bertheau thinks can be easily explained by what precedes; but how can that explain the absence of the &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; of Samuel from our text? Bertheau passes this over in silence; and yet it is just the absence of these words in our text which shows that &#1489;&#1493;&#1509; &#1489;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500; cannot have arisen from an orthographical error and the illegibility of &#1506;&#1494; &#1489;&#1499;&#1500;, since &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; must have been purposely omitted. Bttcher's opinion (N. kr. Aehrenl. iii. S. 224), that the Chaldaizing &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500; can scarcely have been written by the chronicler, because it is not at all like his pure Hebrew style, and that consequently a later reader, who considered it objectionable that a Levite should dance, and perhaps impossible that the bearers should (forgetting that they were released in turn from performing their office), while holding as closely to the letter of the text as possible, corrected &#1506;&#1494; &#1489;&#1499;&#1500; &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1499;&#1512; into &#1489;&#1493;&#1509; &#1489;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500;, and that the same person, or perhaps a later, added besides &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, is still less probable. In that way, indeed, we get no explanation of the main difficulty, viz., how the words from &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; came into the text of the Chronicle, instead of the &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; of Samuel. The supposition that originally the words from &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491; to &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; stood in the text, when of course the statement would be, not only that David danced with all his might, but also that all the Levites who bore the ark danced, is in the highest degree unsatisfactory; for this reason, if for no other, that we cannot conceive how the singers could play the nebel and the kinnor and dance at the same time, since it is not alternations between singing and playing, and dancing and leaping that are spoken of.<p>The discrepancy can only be got rid of by supposing that both narratives are abridged extracts from a more detailed statement, which contained, besides David's dancing, a completer account of the clothing of the king, and of the Levites who took part in the procession. Of these the author of the books of Samuel has communicated only the two characteristic facts, that David danced with all his might before the Lord, and wore an ephod of white; while the author of the Chronicle gives us an account of David's clothing and that of the Levites, while he omits David's dancing. This he does, not because he was scandalized thereby, for he not only gives a hint of it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>, but mentions it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>, which is parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; but because the account of the king's clothing, and of that of the Levites, in so far as the religious meaning of the solemn progress was thereby brought out, appeared to him more important for his design of depicting at length the religious side of the procession. For the clothing of the king had a priestly character; and not only the ephod of white (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>), but also the me&#8219;il of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, white byssus, distinguished the king as head of a priestly people. The me&#8219;il as such was,it is true, an outer garment which every Israelite might wear, but it was worn usually only by persons of rank and distinction (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-19.htm">1 Samuel 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-14.htm">Job 29:14</a>), and white byssus was the material for the priests' garments. Among the articles of clothing which the law prescribed for the official dress of the simple priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>) the &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; was not included, but only the &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;, a tight close-fitting coat; but the priests were not thereby prevented from wearing a me&#8219;il of byssus on special festive occasions, and we are informed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a> that even the Levites and singers were on such occasions clad in byssus. In this way the statement of our verse, that David and all the Levites and bearers of the ark, the singers, and the captain Chenaniah, had put on me&#8219;ilim of byssus, is justified and shown to be in accordance with the circumstances. The words therefore are to be so understood. The words from &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512; are co-ordinate with &#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;, and may translate the verse thus: "David was clothed in a me&#8219;il of byssus, as also were all the Levites," etc. No objection can be taken to the &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512; when we have the article with a nomen regens, for cases of this kind frequently occur where the article, as here, has a strong retrospective force; cf. Ew. 290, d. On the contrary, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; after &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; is meaningless, and can only have come into the text, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>, by an error of the transcriber, although it was so read as early as the time of the lxx. For the last clause, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>. </body></html>
