His Psalm of Thanksgiving.<p>7. Then on that day David delivered first this psalm&#8212;Among the other preparations for this solemn inauguration, the royal bard had composed a special hymn for the occasion. Doubtless it had been previously in the hands of Asaph and his assistants, but it was now publicly committed to them as they entered for the first time on the performance of their sacred duties. It occupies the greater part of this chapter (1Ch 16:8-36), and seems to have been compiled from other psalms of David, previously known to the Israelites, as the whole of it will be found, with very slight variations, in Ps 96:1-13; 105:1-15; 106:47, 48. In the form, however, in which it is given by the sacred historian, it seems to have been the first psalm given for use in the tabernacle service. Abounding, as it does, with the liveliest ascriptions of praise to God for the revelation of His glorious character and the display of His marvellous works and containing, as it does, so many pointed allusions to the origin, privileges, and peculiar destiny of the chosen people, it was admirably calculated to animate the devotions and call forth the gratitude of the assembled multitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then on that day,....

He appointed before the ark, from among the Levites, servants to praise and celebrate God, i.e., singers and players to sing psalms as a part of the regular worship. &#1500;&#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, literally, "in order to bring into remembrance," is not to praise in general, but is to be interpreted according to the &#1500;&#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; in the superscription of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38.htm">Psalm 38</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/70-1.htm">Psalm 70:1-5</a>, by which these psalms are designated as the appointed prayers at the presentation of the Azcarah of the meat-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>). &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; accordingly is a denom. from &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, to present the Azcarah (cf. Del. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-1.htm">Psalm 38:1</a>), and is in our verse to be understood of the recital of these prayer-songs with musical accompaniment. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, to confess, refers to the psalms in which invocation and acknowledgment of the name of the Lord predominates, and &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; to those in which praise (Hallelujah) is the prominent feature. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-6.htm">1 Chronicles 16:6</a> there follow the names of the Levites appointed for this purpose, who have all been already mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19-21</a> as accompanying the ark in its transmission; but all who are there spoken of are not included in our list here. Of the chief singers only Asaph is mentioned, Heman and Ethan being omitted; of the singers and players of the second rank, only nine; six of the eight nebel-players (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-20.htm">1 Chronicles 15:20</a>. &#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500; is a transcriber's error for &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>), and only three of the six kinnor-players; while instead of seven trumpet-blowing priests only two are named, viz., Benaiah, one of those seven, and Jehaziel, whose name does not occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>. </body></html>
