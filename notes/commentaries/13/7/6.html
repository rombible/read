There are variations of reading and probably also variations of tradition in the different lists; e.g. here the sons of Benjamin are reckoned to be <span class="ital">three</span> in number, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-2.htm" title="Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth.">1 Chronicles 8:2</a> to be <span class="ital">five</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Bela, and Becher, and Jediael</span>] These three names come from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a>, <span class="ital">Jediael</span> (“Known to God”) being substituted for the heathen-sounding <span class="ital">Ashbel</span> (= <span class="ital">Ishbaal</span>, “Man of Baal”). The Chronicler in this case conforms literally to the principle laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-17.htm" title="For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.">Hosea 2:17</a>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-1.htm" title="Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third,">1 Chronicles 8:1</a> on the contrary the three names <span class="ital">Bela, Ashbel, Aharah</span> (= <span class="ital">Ahiram</span>) are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm" title="The sons of Benjamin after their families: of Bela, the family of the Belaites: of Ashbel, the family of the Ashbelites: of Ahiram, the family of the Ahiramites:">Numbers 26:38</a> without misgiving.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The sons of <span class="cmt_word">Benjamin; Bela</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Becher</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Jediael</span>, three. We have four passages for our authorities as to the sons of Benjamin, and it is not altogether easy to bring them into verbal harmony. They are <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-41</a>; the present passage; and ch. 8. Our present passage mentions three sons, as though they were all, and immediately proceeds to their posterity. The list in Genesis mentions ten, of whom, however, we know (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-40.htm">Numbers 26:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-3.htm">1 Chronicles 8:3, 4</a>) that three, Naaman, Ard, and Gem, were grandsons, being sons of Bela, under which circumstances the order in which the two former stand in Genesis is remarkable. Again, while Becher is given as the second son in both Genesis and our present place, he is not mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-41</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>. Ashbel, who in Genesis is given as the third, is expressly called the second son. Among the Ephraimites, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>), a Becher, with his descendants the Bachrites, is mentioned, and it is not improbable that, by marriage, the family were at <span class="accented">that time</span>, for manifest reasons of inheritance and possession, reckoned in this tribe, though by blood of the tribe of Benjamin. This subject is skilfully discussed by Lord A. C. Hervey (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:175). Lastly, Jediael of this passage and ver. 10 is not found in Genesis, in Numbers, or in our ch. 8. This name seems to have superseded in our passage the name Ashbel in Genesis, though it is impossible to speak certainly. It cannot be supposed to designate the same person, but rather a descendant in the same branch, whose family had come to importance "in the days of David." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-65.htm">1 Chronicles 6:65-66</a>).
