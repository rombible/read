The reason would seem to be that the names before us represent the chieftains and clans of Bela as they existed at a given epoch, viz., the time of David’s census. The list of 1 Chronicles 8 belongs to another period. Here, as elsewhere, it is evident enough that the chronicler has faithfully followed or rather transcribed his sources, without a thought of harmonising their apparent inconsistencies.<p><span class= "bld">Heads of</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "bld">fathers.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">heads of their</span> <span class= "ital">father-houses, i.e.,</span> chieftains.<p><span class= "bld">And were reckoned by their genealogies.</span>—<span class= "ital">And their census was</span> 22,034.

In an earlier period seven great families of Benjamin are mentioned (Nu 26:38), five of them being headed by these five sons of Benjamin, and two descended from Bela. Here five families of Bela are specified, whence we are led to conclude that time or the ravages of war had greatly changed the condition of Benjamin, or that the five families of Bela were subordinate to the other great divisions that sprang directly from the five sons of the patriarch.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Heads of the house of their fathers; </span> each of them head, or chief, or commander of that house or family from which he was descended, or to which he belonged.
