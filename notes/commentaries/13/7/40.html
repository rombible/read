They are called “choice,” picked men, <span class= "ital">eximii,</span> and chiefs of the princes or emirs. The clans appear to be identified with their chieftains.<p><span class= "bld">And the number throughout the genealogy.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">and their census, in the host, in the battle</span>—<span class= "ital">their number in men was</span> 26,000.” Perhaps we should render <span class= "ital">in the case of service in war.</span> The census here given has reference only to the number of males qualified for military service. In the Mosaic census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-41.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Asher, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 1:41</a>) the total of males of the tribe of Asher was 41,500; and a generation later, the fighting men were 53,000 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-47.htm" title="These are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered of them; who were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.">Numbers 26:47</a>). The date of the present census is not assigned. If it be that of David, which appears likely, the tribe may have declined in numbers and importance by his day.

We can assign no reason why they only should be omitted; but it is the disgrace of the tribe of Dan, that idolatry began in that colony which fixed in Laish, and called it Dan, Jud 18 and there one of the golden calves was set up by Jeroboam. Dan is omitted, Re 7.

The patriarch Ephraim was then alive, though he must have arrived at a very advanced age; and the Hebrew people, at all events those of them who were his descendants, still retained their pastoral character. It was in perfect consistency with the ideas and habits of Oriental shepherds that they should have made a raid on the neighboring tribe of the Philistines for the purpose of plundering their flocks. For nothing is more common among them than hostile incursions on the inhabitants of towns, or on other nomad tribes with whom they have no league of amity. But a different view of the incident is brought out, if, instead of "because," we render the Hebrew particle "when" they came down to take their cattle, for the tenor of the context leads rather to the conclusion that "the men of Gath" were the aggressors, who, making a sudden foray on the Ephraimite flocks, killed the shepherds including several of the sons of Ephraim. The calamity spread a deep gloom around the tent of their aged father, and was the occasion of his receiving visits of condolence from his distant relatives, according to the custom of the East, which is remarkably exemplified in the history of Job (Job 2:11; compare Joh 11:19).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All these were the children of Asher, heads of their father's house,....

The number of Asherites, "of twenty years old and upwards, able to go forth to war," given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-40.htm">Numbers 1:40, 41</a>, was forty-one thousand five hundred. Forty years later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-44.htm">Numbers 26:44-47</a>; comp. ver. 2) the number was fifty-three thousand four hundred. But it is supposed that the twenty-six thousand of this verse may refer only to a portion of the tribe, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the large and distinguished family of Heber. It is to be noticed that the name of the tribe of Asher is not found in the list of the "chief rulers" lower down in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16-22</a>). The tone also in which reference is made to <span class="cmt_word">Asher</span> and Manasseh and Zebulun coming to Jerusalem to Hezekiah's Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11</a>) is very noticeable. This tribe, with Simeon, gave no judge to the nation, and of all the tribes west of the Jordan they stand by themselves in this respect. There is an ancient legend that the parents of St. Paul lived within the territories of Asher, at the place called Ahlab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>, otherwise Giscala, or Gush Chaleb. Against the uncertainty of the legend we may gratefully remember the certainty of the history of the "Anna,...  daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sons of Beriah, Heber and Malchiel, are also to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-17.htm">Genesis 46:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-45.htm">Numbers 26:45</a> as the heads of two families; but the further statement, "he (i.e., Malchiel) the father of Birzavith," is found only here. How &#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514;, the Kethibh, is to be pronounced, cannot be with certainty determined. Gesen. in Thes. p. 239 makes it &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514;, and considers the word to be the name of a woman; Bertheau, on the contrary conjectures that it is a compound of &#1489;&#1512;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; and &#1494;&#1497;&#1514;, "well of the olive-tree," and so the name of a place. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32-34</a> the descendants of Heber are enumerated in three generations, which are mentioned nowhere else. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32</a> we have four sons and one daughter. The name &#1497;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496; is not to be connected with &#1497;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>, "because a family of Asher is not to be sought for in the neighbourhood there referred to" (Berth.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-33.htm">1 Chronicles 7:33</a> we have four sons of Japhlet, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-34.htm">1 Chronicles 7:34</a> the sons of his brother Shemer. It is somewhat remarkable that &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32</a>, is called here &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;. &#1488;&#1495;&#1497; is not an appellative, but a proper name, as the &#1493; before the following name shows; cf. another Ahi in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-15.htm">1 Chronicles 5:15</a>. For &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; we should read &#1493;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;.</body></html>
