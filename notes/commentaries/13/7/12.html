We have seen (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/7-6.htm" title="The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three.">1Chronicles 7:6-11</a>) that <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a> names “Muppim and. Huppim” as sons of Benjamin, and that Numbers 26 has “Snephupham and Hupham” corresponding to the same pair of names. Lastly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-5.htm" title="And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.">1Chronicles 8:5</a> mentions “Shephupham and Huram” among the sons of Bela, son of Benjamin. It is clear that “Muppim” is a mere slip of the pen for “Shuppim,” to which the name Shephupham is really equivalent. From Shephupham, according to Numbers 26, sprang the clan of the “Shuphami” (Shuphamite), as from “Hupham” the clan of the Huphami. Shupham and Hupham are quite natural variants of Shuppim and Huppim. The “Huram” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-5.htm" title="And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.">1Chronicles 8:5</a> is a scribe’s error for “Hupham.” Shuppim and Huppim, called sons of Benjamin in Genesis and Numbers, and sons of Bela in 1 Chronicles 8, are here called “sons of Ir;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-7.htm" title="And the sons of Bela; Ezbon, and Uzzi, and Uzziel, and Jerimoth, and Iri, five; heads of the house of their fathers, mighty men of valor; and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four.">1Chronicles 7:7</a> above informs us that Ir or Iri (? the Irite) was a son of Bela. There is no more contradiction here than there would be in calling the same person a son of David, son of Judah, and son of Abraham.<p><span class= "bld">Hushim, the</span> <span class= "bld">sons of Aher.</span>—The name Hushim (a <span class= "ital">plural</span> form) recurs at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-8.htm" title="And Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab, after he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives.">1Chronicles 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-11.htm" title="And of Hushim he begat Abitub, and Elpaal.">1Chronicles 8:11</a>, as a Benjamite clan. Aher looks like a variant of the Ahiram of Numbers, and the Ahrah of 1 Chronicles 8, and perhaps of the Ehi-Rosh of Genesis. From this it would appear that the whole verse is an appendix to the genealogy of Benjamin. The word Aher, however, happens to mean <span class= "ital">another,</span> and if the reading were certain (comp. the variants Ahiram, Ahrah, &c), would be very singular as a proper name. The clause has been rendered “Hushim. sons of another;” and this odd expression has been taken to be a veiled reference to the tribe of Dan, whose name is omitted in the present section. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-23.htm" title="And the sons of Dan; Hushim.">Genesis 46:23</a>, “And the sons of Dan, Hushim,” a statement occurring like the present clause between that of the sons of Benjamin and the sons of Naphtali, is cited in support of this view. This last coincidence is certainly remarkable; but the following considerations are decidedly adverse to the view in question: 1. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-42.htm" title="These are the sons of Dan after their families: of Shuham, the family of the Shuhamites. These are the families of Dan after their families.">Numbers 26:42</a> calls the offspring of Dan, Shuham, not Hushim, though there also Dan follows Benjamin. 2. Dan is, indeed, omitted here, but so also is Zebulun, just as Gad and Asher are omitted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/27-16.htm" title="Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah:">1Chronicles 27:16-22</a>; and Naphtali here has only one verse 3. The chronicler’s dislike of the tribe of Dan is probably an unfounded supposition, suggested by some accidental omissions; he has mentioned that tribe by name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-2.htm" title="Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.">1Chronicles 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-35.htm" title="And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.">1Chronicles 12:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-22.htm" title="Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.">1Chronicles 27:22</a>. If the omission in the present list be neither accidental nor due to imperfect MSS., it may be ascribed to later editors of the book. (Comp. Judges 18 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/7-5.htm" title="Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand.

Shuppim, Muppim, and Hushim are plural words, and therefore denote not individuals, but the heads of their respective families; and as they were not comprised in the above enumeration (1Ch 7:7, 9) they are inserted here in the form of an appendix. Some render the passage, "Hushim, the son of another," that is, tribe or family. The name occurs among the sons of Dan (Ge 46:23), and it is a presumption in favor of this being the true rendering, that after having recorded the genealogy of Naphtali (1Ch 7:13) the sacred historian adds, "the sons of Bilhah, the handmaid, who was the mother of Dan and Naphtali." We naturally expect, therefore, that these two will be noticed together, but Dan is not mentioned at all, if not in this passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shuppim also, and Huppim, </span> called <span class="ital">Muppim</span> and <span class="ital">Huppim</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a></span>, also <span class="ital">Hupham</span> and <span class="ital">Shupham</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-39.htm" title="Of Shupham, the family of the Shuphamites: of Hupham, the family of the Huphamites.">Numbers 26:39</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The sons of Aher</span>; but divers take the Hebrew word <span class="ital">aher</span> for a common, not proper name, and render the words thus, <span class="ital">another son</span>, or <span class="ital">the son of another</span> family or tribe, to wit, of Dan, as may be gathered, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Besides these, there are five sons of Benjamin spoken of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1-2</a>, - Bela the first, Ashbel the second, Aharah the third, Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth; while in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-3.htm">1 Chronicles 7:3-5</a> five other &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are enumerated, viz., &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; (twice), &#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1503;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1503;, and &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;. If we compare here the statements of the Pentateuch as to the genealogy of Benjamin, we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a> the following sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi (&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;) and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard (&#1488;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;); and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-40</a> seven families, of which five are descended from his sons Bela, Ashbel, Ahiram, Shephupham, and Hupham (&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1501;); and two from his grandsons, the sons of Bela, Ard and Naaman. From this we learn, not only that of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a> at least two were grandsons, but also that the names &#1488;&#1495;&#1497; and &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (Gen.) are only other forms of &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1501; (Num.). It is, however, somewhat strange that among the families (in Num.) the names &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, and &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; are wanting. The explanation which at once suggests itself, that their descendants were not numerous enough to form separate families, and that they on that account were received into the families of the other sons, though it may be accepted in the case of Gera and Rosh, of whom it is nowhere recorded that they had numerous descendants, cannot meet the case of Becher, for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-8.htm">1 Chronicles 7:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-9.htm">1 Chronicles 7:9</a> of our chapter mention is made of nine sons of his, with a posterity of 20,200 men. The supposition that the name of Becher and his family has been dropped from the genealogical register of the families in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>, will not appear in the slightest degree probable, when we consider the accuracy of this register in other respects. The only remaining explanation therefore is, that the descendants of Becher were in reality not numerous enough to form a &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; by themselves, but had afterwards so increased that they numbered nine fathers'-houses, with a total of 20,200 valiant warriors. The numbers in our register point unquestionably to post-Mosaic times; for at the second numbering by Moses, all the families of Benjamin together numbered only 45,600 men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-41.htm">Numbers 26:41</a>), while the three families mentioned in our verses number together 59,434 (22,034 + 20,200 + 17,200). The tribe of Benjamin, which moreover was entirely destroyed, with the exception of 600 men, in the war which it waged against the other tribes in the earlier part of the period of the judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-47.htm">Judges 20:47</a>), could not have increased to such an extent before the times of David and Solomon. The name of the third son of Benjamin, Jediael, occurs only here, and is considered by the older commentators to be another name of Ashbel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>), which cannot indeed be accepted as a certainty, but is very probable.</body></html>
