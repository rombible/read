In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a> it is more clearly put &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, for the remaining Merarites are not spoken of. What is intended to be said is, that the Merarites, alone of the Levites, are still to be mentioned. In the tribe of Zebulun, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-77.htm">1 Chronicles 6:77</a>, only two cities are named, Rimmon and Tabor, instead of the four - Jokneam, Karthah, Dimnah, and Nahalal - in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a>. The first two names have been dropped out of our text, while &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493; corresponds to the &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; of Joshua, but is a more correct reading, since &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-13.htm">Joshua 19:13</a> among the cities of Zebulun, while &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; is not mentioned; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; must consequently correspond to the &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1500; in Joshua. Nahalal occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a> and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>, in the form Nahalol, among the cities of Zebulun, and consequently seems to be the more correct name, but has not yet been pointed out with certainty, since its identification with Mlul (Arabic m&#8219;lu&#770;l), south-west from Nazareth, rests upon very slender foundation. Bertheau's conjecture that the name of the city has been dropped out, and that of a more exact description of its position, perhaps &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-12.htm">Joshua 19:12</a>, only the last word has remained, is no more probable than that of Movers, that instead of the name of the city, only the neighbourhood in which the city lay, viz., Mount Tabor, is mentioned.</body></html>
