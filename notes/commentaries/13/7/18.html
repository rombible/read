We can assign no reason why they only should be omitted; but it is the disgrace of the tribe of Dan, that idolatry began in that colony which fixed in Laish, and called it Dan, Jud 18 and there one of the golden calves was set up by Jeroboam.

The text, as it stands, is so confused and complicated that it is exceedingly difficult to trace the genealogical thread, and a great variety of conjectures have been made with a view to clear away the obscurity. The passage [1Ch 7:14, 15] should probably be rendered thus: "The sons of Manasseh were Ashriel, whom his Syrian concubine bare to him, and Machir, the father of Gilead (whom his wife bare to him).

The first half, "And Shuppim and Huppim, sons of Ir," would seem, if we may judge from the &#1493; cop., to enumerate some other descendants of Benjamin. And besides, (1) the names &#1493;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a> among those of the sons of Benjamin, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-39.htm">Numbers 26:39</a>, among the families of Benjamin, one called &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1502;&#1497; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1501;, and another &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1502;&#1497; from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1501;, are introduced; we must consequently hold &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; to be an error for &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1501; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1501;. And (2) the name &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is most probably identical with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-7.htm">1 Chronicles 7:7</a>. The peculiar forms of those names, viz., &#1493;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1501;, seem to have arisen from an improper comparison of them with &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>, in which the fact was overlooked that the Huppim and Shuppim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a> belong to the Manassites. Here, therefore, two other families descended from the Benjamite Ir or Iri would seem to be mentioned, which may easily be reconciled with the purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6</a>) to mention none of the Benjamites but the descendants of Bela, Becher, and Jediael. The further statement, "Hushim, sons of Aher," is utterly enigmatical. The name &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-23.htm">Genesis 46:23</a> as that of Dan's only son, who, however, is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-42.htm">Numbers 26:42</a> &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;, and who founded the family of the Shuhami. But as the names &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are again met with in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-8.htm">1 Chronicles 8:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-11.htm">1 Chronicles 8:11</a> among the Benjamites, there is no need to imagine any connection between our &#1495;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501; and that family.<p>The word &#1488;&#1492;&#1512;, alius, is not indeed found elsewhere as a nomen proprium, but may notwithstanding be so here; when we might, notwithstanding the want of the conjunction w, take the Hushim sons of Aher to be another Benjamite family. In that case, certainly, the tribe of Dan would be omitted from our chapter; but we must not allow that to lead us into arbitrary hypotheses, as not only Dan but also Zebulun is omitted.<p>(Note: Bertheau's judgment in the matter is different. Starting from the facts that &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>) is called a son of Dan, and that further, in the enumeration of the tribes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>, Dan follows after Benjamin; that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a> Dan stands between Benjamin and Naphtali, and that in our chapter, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-13.htm">1 Chronicles 7:13</a>, the sons of Naphtali follow immediately; and that the closing words of this verse, "sons of Bilhah," can, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-25.htm">Genesis 46:25</a>, refer only to Dan and Naphtali, and consequently presuppose that Dan or his descendants have been mentioned in our passage, - he thinks there can be no doubt that originally Danites were mentioned in our verse, and that &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; was introduced as the son of Dan. Moreover, from the word &#1488;&#1492;&#1512;, "the other," he draws the further inference that it may have been, according to its meaning, the covert designation of a man whose proper name fear, or dislike of some sort, prevented men from using, and was probably a designation of the tribe of Dan, which set up its own worship, and so separated itself from the congregation of Israel; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17.htm">Judges 17</a>f. The name is avoided, he says, in our chapter, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-69.htm">1 Chronicles 6:69</a>, and is named only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-2.htm">1 Chronicles 2:2</a> among the twelve tribes of Israel, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-35.htm">1 Chronicles 12:35</a>. The conjecture, therefore, is forced upon us, that &#1488;&#1492;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; &#1495;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, "Hushim the son of the other," viz., of the other son of Bilhah, whose name he wished to pass over in silence, stands for &#1495;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501; &#1491;&#1503; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;. The name Aher, then, had so completely concealed the tribe of Dan, that later readers did not mark the new commencement, notwithstanding the want of the conjunction, and had no scruple in adding the well-known names of the Benjamites, &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1501; and &#1495;&#1508;&#1501;, to the similarly-sounding &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, though probably at first only in the margin. This hypothesis has no solid foundation. The supposed dislike to mention the name of Dan rests upon an erroneous imagination, as is manifest from the thrice repeated mention of that name, not merely in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-2.htm">1 Chronicles 2:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-35.htm">1 Chronicles 12:35</a>, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-22.htm">1 Chronicles 27:22</a>. The omission of the tribe of Dan in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-69.htm">1 Chronicles 6:69</a>, is only the result of a corruption of the text in these passages; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a> the words, "Ephraim and of the tribe of Dan," and after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-69.htm">1 Chronicles 6:69</a> a whole verse, have been dropped out in the copying. In neither of these verses can there by any idea of omitting the name Dan because of a dislike to mention it, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a> the name Ephraim is lacking, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-69.htm">1 Chronicles 6:69</a> the names of two cities are also omitted, where even Berth. cannot suppose any "dislike." When Berth. quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a> in favour of his concealment hypothesis, where under the Keri &#1502;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; the name &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is supposed to be concealed, he has forgotten that the opinion that in this passage &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; has been altered into &#1502;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; from a foolish dislike, is one of the rabbinic caprices, which we cannot attribute as a matter of course to the authors of the biblical writings. With this groundless suspicion falls of itself the attempt which he bases upon it "to solve the enigma of our verse." If the words in question do really contain a remark concerning the family of Dan, we must suppose, with Ewald (Gesch. i. S. 242), that the text has become corrupt, several words having been dropped out. Yet the &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-13.htm">1 Chronicles 7:13</a> is not sufficient to warrant such a supposition. Had the register originally contained not only the sons of Naphtali, but also the sons of Dan, so that &#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1492; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; would have to be referred to both, the conj. &#1493; could not have been omitted before &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. The want of this conjunction is, however, in conformity with the whole plan of our register, in which all the tribes follow, one after the other, without a conjunction; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-30.htm">1 Chronicles 7:30</a>. &#1493; is found only before &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-20.htm">1 Chronicles 7:20</a>, because Ephraim and Manasseh are closely connected, both continuing to form the one tribe of Joseph. We must accordingly hold &#1504;&#1507; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-13.htm">1 Chronicles 7:13</a>, without &#1493; cop., to have been the original reading, when the conjecture that &#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1492; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; includes also the sons of Dan is at once disposed of.)  </body></html>
