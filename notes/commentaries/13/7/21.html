So “Tahath” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-26.htm" title="And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.">Numbers 33:26</a>) was a desert station of Israel.

It is perhaps best to consider Ezer and Elead <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-21.htm">1 Chronicles 7:21</a> as not sons of Zabad and brothers of the second Shuthelah, but natural sons of Ephraim. The passage would then run thusly:<p>"And the sons of Ephraim, Shuthelah (and Bered was his son, and Tahath his son and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son, and Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son) and Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath slew" (i. e. the settled inhabitants, as contrasted with the nomadic Hebrews, Amalekites, etc.). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. whom the men of Gath &#8230; slew, &c.&#8212;This interesting little episode gives us a glimpse of the state of Hebrew society in Egypt; for the occurrence narrated seems to have taken place before the Israelites left that country. The patriarch Ephraim was then alive, though he must have arrived at a very advanced age; and the Hebrew people, at all events those of them who were his descendants, still retained their pastoral character. It was in perfect consistency with the ideas and habits of Oriental shepherds that they should have made a raid on the neighboring tribe of the Philistines for the purpose of plundering their flocks. For nothing is more common among them than hostile incursions on the inhabitants of towns, or on other nomad tribes with whom they have no league of amity. But a different view of the incident is brought out, if, instead of "because," we render the Hebrew particle "when" they came down to take their cattle, for the tenor of the context leads rather to the conclusion that "the men of Gath" were the aggressors, who, making a sudden foray on the Ephraimite flocks, killed the shepherds including several of the sons of Ephraim. The calamity spread a deep gloom around the tent of their aged father, and was the occasion of his receiving visits of condolence from his distant relatives, according to the custom of the East, which is remarkably exemplified in the history of Job (Job 2:11; compare Joh 11:19).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This history is not recorded elsewhere in Scripture, but it is in the ancient Hebrew writers, though mixed with many fables. The Philistines (one of whose cities this Gath was) and the Egyptians were next neighbours; and in those ancient times it was usual for such to make inroads one into another’s country, and to carry thence what prey they could take, as we find both in Scripture and in profane writers. And as the Philistines had probably made such inroads formerly into Egypt, and particularly into the land of Goshen, which was the utmost part of Egypt bordering upon the Philistines’ land; so the Israelites might requite them in the like kind: and particularly the children of Ephraim, either presuming upon their numbers and strength, or having possibly received the greatest injury from the Philistines in their last invasion, might make an attempt upon the Philistines to their own great loss, as is here related. And this seems to have happened a little before the Egyptian persecution, and before the reign of that <span class="ital">new king</span> mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-8.htm" title="Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.">Exodus 1:8</a></span>. The Philistines are here called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the men of Gath, </span> either because they were subject to the king of Gath, as afterwards that people were, or because they lived about Gath. And this clause, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that were born in that land, </span> may be added emphatically, as the motive which made them more resolute and furious in their fight with the Ephraimites, because they fought in and for their own land, wherein all their wealth and concerns lay, and against those that unjustly endeavoured to turn them out of their native country. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Zabad his son,....

According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-16.htm">1 Chronicles 7:16</a>, on the contrary, Maachah is the wife of Machir, and we should consequently expect to find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a> only the simple statement, "And Machir took a wife whose name was Maachah." From the words &#1502;&#1506;&#1499;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493; &#1502;&#1506;&#1499;&#1492; sdrow eh &#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1495;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; no meaning which harmonizes with the context can be obtained. Since &#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; signifies "to take a wife for one" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-2.htm">Judges 14:2</a>), we can only suppose that by the names Huppim and Shuppim Machir's sons are meant, to whom he, as their father, gave wives. But we cannot suppose that the sons of Machir are referred to, for the birth of the sons is first mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-16.htm">1 Chronicles 7:16</a>. But we have found the names &#1495;&#1508;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1501; spoken of as descendants of Benjamin; and Bertheau consequently conjectures that these names have been brought thence into our verse by some gloss, and that the beginning of our verse originally stood thus: &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1499;&#1501; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; &#1493;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "And Machir took a wife whose name is Maachah, and the name of his sister if Hammoleketh" (the last according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-18.htm">1 Chronicles 7:18</a>). By this means we certainly bring some meaning into the words; but we cannot venture to maintain that this conjecture corresponds to the original text, but rather incline to doubt it. For, in the first place, the following words, "And the name of the second (is) Zelophehad," do not suit the proposed reading. Berth. must here alter &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; into &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; (the name of his brother). But even after this alteration, the mention of the brother of Machir is not suitable to the context; and moreover Zelophehad was not a true brother, but only a nephew of Machir, the son of his brother Hepher; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-33.htm">Numbers 26:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>. And besides this, according to the concluding formula, "These are the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>), we should expect to find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-16.htm">1 Chronicles 7:16</a>, not merely sons or descendants of Machir, but rather descendants of Gilead. We therefore hold the statement of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>, "And the name of the second if Zelophehad, and Zelophehad had (only) daughters," to be correct and beyond criticism, and the first part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a> to be corrupt and defective; and conjecture that a son of Gilead's was mentioned in it, to whose name the words, "And the name of the second," etc., belonged. This son who was mentioned in the text, which has been handed down to us only in a defective state, was probably the Ashriel mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14</a>, a son of Gilead, whose descent from Machir was given more in detail in the corrupt and consequently meaningless first half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>, other descendants of Machir by his wife Maachah are enumerated, which favours the probable conjecture that the wife whom Machir took, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>, was different from Maachah, that Machir had two wives, and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a> originally the sons of the first were enumerated, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-16.htm">1 Chronicles 7:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>, the sons of the second. Peresh and Shelesh are mentioned only here. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, "his sons" (that is, the sons of the last-named, Shelesh), were Ulam and Rakem, names which are also met with only here. The name &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1503; is found in our Masoretic text, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a>, as the name of a judge, but probably &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; should be read instead.</body></html>
