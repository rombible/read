The patriarch Ephraim was then alive, though he must have arrived at a very advanced age; and the Hebrew people, at all events those of them who were his descendants, still retained their pastoral character. It was in perfect consistency with the ideas and habits of Oriental shepherds that they should have made a raid on the neighboring tribe of the Philistines for the purpose of plundering their flocks. For nothing is more common among them than hostile incursions on the inhabitants of towns, or on other nomad tribes with whom they have no league of amity. But a different view of the incident is brought out, if, instead of "because," we render the Hebrew particle "when" they came down to take their cattle, for the tenor of the context leads rather to the conclusion that "the men of Gath" were the aggressors, who, making a sudden foray on the Ephraimite flocks, killed the shepherds including several of the sons of Ephraim. The calamity spread a deep gloom around the tent of their aged father, and was the occasion of his receiving visits of condolence from his distant relatives, according to the custom of the East, which is remarkably exemplified in the history of Job (Job 2:11; compare Joh 11:19).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His daughter, </span> i.e. his grandchild, or great-grandchild, for such are oft called <span class="ital">sons</span> or <span class="ital">daughters</span> in Scripture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who built Beth-horon, </span> i.e. rebuilt or repaired, which possibly she did in Joshua’s time.

If the literal interpretation of this whole section be accepted, according to which both Ephraim and Beriah must have passed their lifetime in Egypt, the "daughter," strictly so called, of either the one or the other could not have been the founder of the places here mentioned. The word "daughter" must, therefore, represent simply a female descendant.

Of her sons, Ishod, i.e., "man of splendour," is not elsewhere mentioned. The name Abiezer occurs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a>, as that of the head of one of the families of Manasseh. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-30.htm">Numbers 26:30</a>, however, he is called Jeezer, which is probably the original reading, and consequently our Abiezer is different from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a>. Another circumstance which speaks strongly against the identification of the two men is, that the family descended from Jeezer holds the first place among the families of Manasseh, which is not at all consonant with the position of the son of Machir's sister here mentioned. Of the family of Abiezer came the judge Gideon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-15.htm">Judges 11:15</a>.
