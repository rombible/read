No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The skill of the Benjamites as archers is noted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>.

Ismaiah the Gibeonite&#8212;It appears that not only the Canaanites who were admitted into the congregation (Jos 9:1-27), but people of the tribe of Benjamin, were among the inhabitants of Gibeon. The mention of "the Gederathite," probably from Gederah (Jos 15:36), in the lowlands of Judah; of the Korhites (1Ch 12:6), from Korah (1Ch 2:43), and of Gedor (1Ch 12:7), a town in Judah, to the southwest of Beth-lehem (compare 1Ch 4:4), shows that this first list contains men of Judah as well as Benjamin [Bertheau].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites.

Some authorities are as positive that this name designates Levitic <span class="accented">Korahites</span>, as others are sceptical about it. Bertheau explains the name as meaning descendants of Korah of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-43.htm">1 Chronicles 2:43</a>). Others surmise that a Benjamite Korah, otherwise unknown to us, is pointed to. There does not seem any intrinsic difficulty in supposing that these were some of the Levite Korahites, whose proper and allotted abode was in Benjamin, or perhaps in Judah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;, which, so far as the form is concerned, is not a nomen gentil., Reland (Palaest. ill. p. 899) holds for a contraction of &#1510;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1488; &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500;, Migdal Zebujah-a place which, according to the rabbins, is said to have been somewhere in the neighbourhood of Hebron.
