Happy are those who wisely perceive it to be their duty and interest, to submit to the Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of David; who renounce for his sake all that is not consistent; whose earnest endeavours to do good are directed by the wisdom that God giveth, through acquaintance with his word, experience, and observation. If any man lack this wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "These are the numbers of the men, ready equipped for the host, that came to David, etc."<p>In the list which follows such points as<p>(1) The large mumber sent by the trans-Jordanic tribes;<p>(2) The large numbers from Zebulon, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan, all tribes somewhat remote, and generally speaking undistinguished;<p>(3) The small size of the contingent from Judah, which is generally represented as numerically superior to every other tribe, and which might have been expected to be especially zealous on behalf of its own prince and tribesman; throw some doubt upon the numbers, which may be suspected of having in some instances undergone corruption. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 12:23-40.

The Manassites went over "when David went with the Philistines against Israel to the war, and (yet) helped them not; for upon advisement (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1492;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-18.htm">Proverbs 20:18</a>), the lords of the Philistines had sent him away, saying, 'For our heads, he will fall away to his master Saul.' " <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2-11</a> contains the historical commentary on this event. When the lords of the Philistines collected their forces to march against Saul, David, who had found refuge with King Achish, was compelled to join the host of that prince with his band. But when the other Philistine princes saw the Hebrews, they demanded that they should be sent out of the army, as they feared that David might turn upon them during the battle, and so win favour by his treachery with Saul his lord. See the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1-11</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, for our heads, i.e., for the price of them, giving them as a price to obtain a friendly reception from Saul (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-4.htm">1 Samuel 29:4</a>). In consequence of this remonstrance, Achish requested David to return with his warriors to Ziklag. On this return march ("as he went to Ziklag," cf. with &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; the &#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-11.htm">1 Samuel 29:11</a>), and consequently before the battle in which Saul lost his life (Berth.), and not after Saul's great misfortune, as Ewald thinks, the Manassites whose names follow went over to David. The seven named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-20.htm">1 Chronicles 12:20</a> were "heads of the thousands of Manasseh," i.e., of the great families into which the tribe of Manasseh was divided, and as such were leaders of the Manassite forces in war: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-14.htm">Numbers 31:14</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>, and the commentary on the latter passage. </body></html>
