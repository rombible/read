No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The skill of the Benjamites as archers is noted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>.

Ismaiah the Gibeonite&#8212;It appears that not only the Canaanites who were admitted into the congregation (Jos 9:1-27), but people of the tribe of Benjamin, were among the inhabitants of Gibeon. The mention of "the Gederathite," probably from Gederah (Jos 15:36), in the lowlands of Judah; of the Korhites (1Ch 12:6), from Korah (1Ch 2:43), and of Gedor (1Ch 12:7), a town in Judah, to the southwest of Beth-lehem (compare 1Ch 4:4), shows that this first list contains men of Judah as well as Benjamin [Bertheau].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Over the thirty, </span> i.e. who came attended with thirty valiant Benjamites, and was their leader and commander. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty,....

Probably however the list in ch. 11 and that in ch. 12 belong to different times.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Gederathite</span>] i.e. the man of Gederah. The only Gederah known was in the Judæan Shephelah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-36.htm" title="And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:36</a>), so that it would seem that some men of Judah are reckoned along with the Benjamites in these verses. Similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-7.htm" title="And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.">1 Chronicles 12:7</a> men of the Judæan town of <span class="ital">Gedor</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm" title="And Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah.

Yet the name of <span class="cmt_word">Ismaiah</span> does not appear in the list of the preceding chapter, nor in its parallel; nor is it possible to identify it with any that does appear there. The suggested explanation is that he was in the <span class="accented">first edition</span> of that list, and died early. The expression, "among the thirty, and over the thirty," may possibly mean that, from distinction as one of them, he was promoted above them to be leader of them. <span class="cmt_word">Josabad the Gederathite</span>. The name should be spelt Jozabad. The Gederah here suggested cannot to all appearance be that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>, in the Shephelah of Judah, as Jozabad was a Benjamite. If otherwise, it must be supposed to have come in some way into the possession of Benjamin. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, he of the city Ashtaroth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-56.htm">1 Chronicles 6:56</a>), in the trans-Jordanic domain of Manasseh. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;, he of Aroer, or Reuben or Gad (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>). </body></html>
