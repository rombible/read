The latter seems preferable here.

There follow (vers. 24-37) the numbers of each tribe (the full <span class="accented">thirteen</span> being enumerated) who "came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel." The large numbers of some of the joyful pilgrims to Hebron, as for instance of the trans-Jordanic tribes, the very small number that came of the tribe of Judah (in fact, lowest but one, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Benjamin, and yet nearest home), and of some others, help to invest with doubt the numerals of this passage, although it is not at all difficult to suggest some very passable explanations of these phenomena. This doubt is not lessened by the total, which, according to this list, must make a figure between three hundred and forty thousand and three hundred and fifty thousand men. To the host have to be added, as we are expressly told, the "asses, camels, mules, and oxen," which carried the "bread, meat, meal, cakes of figs and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance," for the consumption of the host during their "three days' "stay "with David," and their journeys to and fro. In the presence of such numbers, and the celebration of such an occasion, Hebron must indeed have beheld the reflection of its own probable meaning, of the "fellowship" or "community" of society. <span class="cmt_word">To turn the kingdom of Saul to him</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-14.htm">1 Chronicles 10:14</a>).

Their names are not in the lists, possibly because they were not handed down in the historical works made use of by the chronicler. At their head, as we learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>, stood Amasai, chief of the thirty, i.e., of the corps formed of the thirty heroes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>), although his name does not occur in the catalogue, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11.htm">1 Chronicles 11</a>. According to this, Amasai must have occupied a very important position under David; but since the name &#1506;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; is not elsewhere mentioned in the history of David, the older commentators have conjectured that &#1506;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; may have been the same person as &#1506;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, son of Abigail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>), whom Absalom made captain in Joab's place, and whom David, after the victory over the rebels, wished to make commander-in-chief in the room of Joab, and whom for that reason Joab afterwards murdered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-14.htm">2 Samuel 19:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-4.htm">2 Samuel 20:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>.); or identical with &#1488;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; the son of Zeruiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-16.htm">1 Chronicles 2:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-20.htm">1 Chronicles 11:20</a>. Of these conjectures the first is much more probable than the second. To meet these men, David went forth from his fastness, and asked them with what purpose they came to him. "If for peace," to stand by him, "then shall there be to me towards you a heart for union," i.e., I will be with you of one heart, be true to you. &#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489;&#1489; is plainer than &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>. "But if &#1500;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;, to practise deceit against me (to be guilty of a &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;) for mine enemies (to deliver me to them), although there be no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon and punish;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm">2 Chronicles 24:22</a>. The God of our fathers, i.e., of the patriarchs (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-13.htm">Exodus 3:13</a>.), who rules in and over Israel, who shields the innocent and punishes the guilty. </body></html>
