The yoke of Saul seemed heavy even to his own tribe (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/8-11.htm" title="And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots....">1 Samuel 8:11-18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">while he yet kept himself close</span>] Render, <span class="bld">while he was yet shut up</span>.

The occasion referred to is evidently that recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1, 2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1, 26</a>; and generally in those and the intermediate chapters. David stayed at Ziklag a year and four months, a period which closed for him with the death of Saul. Ziklag, in Joshus's original allotment, was the possession of Simeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-5.htm">Joshua 19:5</a>). It was situated south of Judah, and came into the hands of Judah when Achish made it a gift to David for a rest-deuce (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5-7</a>). The site of it has not been identified in later times. It witnessed one of the narrowest and most remarkable of the escapes of David, on an occasion which brought danger, not so much from acknowledged foes, as from the maddened grief and despair of his own friends and people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3-6</a>). The whole scene of the broken-hearted grief of David and his people, when, on discovering the successful raid of the Amalekites upon Ziklag, "they lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep," is one of the most dramatic on record. The rapid reverse to good fortune, when David turns away their heedless anger against himself and proposal to stone him, by pursuing and overcoming the enemy, and recovering their captives and their goods near the brook Besor, completes the effectiveness of the scene. The <span class="accented">middle voice</span> form of expression in this verse, kept himself close, means to say that David was, by fear of Saul and by force of his enemies, more or less hemmed up in Ziklag. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-21.htm">1 Chronicles 11:21</a> should be translated: honoured before the three as two; i.e., doubly honoured-he became to them prince, leader. With regard to &#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which, as meaningless, Bertheau would alter so as to make it correspond with &#1492;&#1499;&#1497; (Sam.), cf. Ew. Lehrb. 269, b. For Benaiah and his exploits, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22-25</a>, see the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20-23</a>.<p>No special deeds of the heroes enumerated in vv. 26-47 are related, so that we may regard them as a third class, who are not equal to the first triad, and to the second pair, Abishai and Benaiah, and consequently occupied a subordinate place in the collective body of the royal body-guards. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a> thirty-two names are mentioned, which, with the above-mentioned three and two of the first and second classes, amount in all to thirty-seven men, as is expressly remarked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a> at the conclusion. In the text of the Chronicle no number is mentioned, and the register is increased by sixteen names (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41-47</a>), which have been added in the course of time to the earlier number. The words &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-26.htm">1 Chronicles 11:26</a>, are to be regarded as a superscription: And valiant heroes were, etc.; equivalent to, But besides there, there remain still the following valiant heroes. The words &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; are not synonymous with &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, leaders of the host, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>, (Berth.), but signify heroes in warlike strength, i.e., heroic warriors, like &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;   (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-5.htm">1 Chronicles 7:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-7.htm">1 Chronicles 7:7</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-11.htm">1 Chronicles 7:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-40.htm">1 Chronicles 7:40</a>). That &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; has here the article, while it is not found in the passages quoted from the seventh chapter, does not make any difference in the meaning of the words. The article is used, here, as with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, because the heroes of David are spoken of, and &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is to be mentally supplied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>. As to the names in vv. 26-41, which are also found in the register in the book of Samuel, see the commentary to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24-39</a>. This list, which is common to both books, begins with Asahel, a brother of Joab, who was slain by Abner in the war which he waged against David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-19.htm">2 Samuel 2:19-23</a>), and concludes in the book of Samuel with Uriah the Hittite, so well known from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-3.htm">2 Samuel 11:3</a>. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41</a>), with whose wife David committed adultery. But to the continuation of the register which is found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41-47</a> of our text, there is no parallel in the other writings of the Old Testament by which we might form an idea as to the correctness of the names. The individual names are indeed to be met with, for the most part, in other parts of the Old Testament, but denote other men of an earlier or later time. The names &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-45.htm">1 Chronicles 11:45</a>, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-46.htm">1 Chronicles 11:46</a>., are found also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-20.htm">1 Chronicles 12:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-11.htm">1 Chronicles 12:11</a>, among those of the valiant men who before Saul's death went over to David, but we cannot with any certainty ascertain whether the persons meant were the same. The expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-42.htm">1 Chronicles 11:42</a>) is also obscure, - "and to him in addition," i.e., together with him, thirty, - since the thought that with Adina the chief of the Reubenites, or besides him, there were thirty (men), has no meaning in this register. The lxx and the Vulgate read &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, while the Syriac, on the contrary, makes use of the periphrasis, "And even he was a ruler over thirty heroes;" and Bertheau accordingly recommends the emendation &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;, and thence concludes that the tribe of Reuben had thirty leaders in its army-a conjecture as bold as it is improbable. Were &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; to be read, we could not but refer the words to the thirty heroes of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, and hold Adina to be their leader, which could not be easily reconciled with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-4.htm">1 Chronicles 12:4</a>. </body></html>
