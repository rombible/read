Bertheau, on the contrary, thinks on various grounds that &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; refers to all the heroes who have been spoken of in vv. 1-20. In the first place, it was not the Manassites alone who took part in the conflict with Amalek, for David won the victory with his whole force of 600 men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-9.htm">1 Samuel 30:9</a>), among whom, without doubt, those named in vv. 1-18 were included. Then, secondly, a clear distinction is made between those who gave in their adhesion to and helped David at an earlier period (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-7.htm">1 Chronicles 12:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22</a>), and those who came to him in Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23</a>). And finally, the general remark in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22</a> is connected with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-21.htm">1 Chronicles 12:21</a> by the grounding &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, so that we must regard <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-21.htm">1 Chronicles 12:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22</a> as a subscription closing the preceding catalogues. but none of these arguments are very effective. The grounding &#1499;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22</a> does not refer to the whole of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-21.htm">1 Chronicles 12:21</a>, but only to the last clause, or, to be more accurate, only to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;, showing that David had an army. The second proves nothing, and in the first only so much is correct, that not merely the seven Manassites named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-20.htm">1 Chronicles 12:20</a> took, part in the battle with Amalek, but also the warriors who had formerly gone over to David; but from that there is not the slightest reason to conclude that this is expressed by &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;. It is manifest from the context and the plan of the register, that &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; can only refer to those of whom it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-20.htm">1 Chronicles 12:20</a> that they went over to David as he was returning to Ziklag. If <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-21.htm">1 Chronicles 12:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22</a> were a subscription to all the preceding registers, instead of &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; another expression which would separate the verse somewhat more from that immediately preceding would have been employed, perhaps &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;.)<p>helped David &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500;, against the detachment of Amalekites, who during David's absence had surprised and burnt Ziklag, and led captive the women and children (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1-10</a>). This interpretation, which Rashi also has (contra turmam Amalekitarum), and which the Vulgate hints at in its adversus latrunculos, rests upon the fact that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-8.htm">1 Samuel 30:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-15.htm">1 Samuel 30:15</a>, the word &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, which in general only denotes single detachments or predatory bands, is used of the Amalekite band; whence the word can only refer to the march of David against the Amalekites, of which we have an account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-9.htm">1 Samuel 30:9</a>., and not to the combats which he had with Saul. "For they were all valiant heroes, and were &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, captains in the army," sc. which gathered round David. </body></html>
