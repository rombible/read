No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The band of the rovers - See the marginal reference. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. the host of God&#8212;that is, a great and powerful army.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At that time, </span> i.e. while he was at Ziklag, and in his march to Hebron, and principally at Hebron, as the next verse explains it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Like the host of God, </span> i.e. innumerable, like the stars or angels, both which are called God’s hosts.

The for with which this verse commences probably explains the call there was for many and able "captains" for a host becoming daily larger. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There came to David in the mountain-fastness also men of Benjamin and Judah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). Their names are not in the lists, possibly because they were not handed down in the historical works made use of by the chronicler. At their head, as we learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>, stood Amasai, chief of the thirty, i.e., of the corps formed of the thirty heroes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>), although his name does not occur in the catalogue, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11.htm">1 Chronicles 11</a>. According to this, Amasai must have occupied a very important position under David; but since the name &#1506;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; is not elsewhere mentioned in the history of David, the older commentators have conjectured that &#1506;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; may have been the same person as &#1506;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, son of Abigail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>), whom Absalom made captain in Joab's place, and whom David, after the victory over the rebels, wished to make commander-in-chief in the room of Joab, and whom for that reason Joab afterwards murdered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-14.htm">2 Samuel 19:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-4.htm">2 Samuel 20:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>.); or identical with &#1488;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; the son of Zeruiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-16.htm">1 Chronicles 2:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-20.htm">1 Chronicles 11:20</a>. Of these conjectures the first is much more probable than the second. To meet these men, David went forth from his fastness, and asked them with what purpose they came to him. "If for peace," to stand by him, "then shall there be to me towards you a heart for union," i.e., I will be with you of one heart, be true to you. &#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489;&#1489; is plainer than &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>. "But if &#1500;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;, to practise deceit against me (to be guilty of a &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;) for mine enemies (to deliver me to them), although there be no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon and punish;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm">2 Chronicles 24:22</a>. The God of our fathers, i.e., of the patriarchs (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-13.htm">Exodus 3:13</a>.), who rules in and over Israel, who shields the innocent and punishes the guilty. </body></html>
