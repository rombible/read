On the other hand, “Gedor” was a town of Judah, south-west of Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm" title="And Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah. These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, the father of Bethlehem.">1Chronicles 4:4</a>). Some account for the appearance of Judæan names in a list purporting to relate to Benjaminites, by the assumption that the chronicler has welded two; lists into one; but towns did not always continue in the hands of the tribes to whom they were originally intended, and some Judæan towns may have contained a partially Benjaminite population.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-22 Here is an account of those who appeared and acted as David's friends, while he was persecuted. No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The skill of the Benjamites as archers is noted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>.

Ismaiah the Gibeonite&#8212;It appears that not only the Canaanites who were admitted into the congregation (Jos 9:1-27), but people of the tribe of Benjamin, were among the inhabitants of Gibeon. The mention of "the Gederathite," probably from Gederah (Jos 15:36), in the lowlands of Judah; of the Korhites (1Ch 12:6), from Korah (1Ch 2:43), and of Gedor (1Ch 12:7), a town in Judah, to the southwest of Beth-lehem (compare 1Ch 4:4), shows that this first list contains men of Judah as well as Benjamin [Bertheau].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

If it be the Gedor in Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>), it is to be noted still that Jeroham is a name of a Benjamite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Benjamites who came to David to Ziklag. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1</a>. Ziklag was originally allotted to the Simeonites by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-5.htm">Joshua 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-30.htm">1 Chronicles 4:30</a>), but at a later time came into possession of the Philistines, and was assigned and presented by king Achish to David, who had fled for refuge to him, as a dwelling-place for himself and his followers; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1-7</a>. As to its situation, which has not yet been with certainty ascertained, see the discussion on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-31.htm">Joshua 15:31</a>. In it David dwelt for a year and four months, until he went to Hebron on the death of Saul. During this time it was that the warriors of the tribe of Benjamin mentioned in the succeeding register went over to him, as we learn from the words &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;, "he was still held back before Saul," a concise expression for "while he was still held back before Saul." This last expression, however, does not signify, "hindered from coming before Saul" (Berth.), but inter Israelitas publice versari prohibitus (J. H. Mich.), or rather, "before Saul, imprisoned as it were, without being able to appear in a manner corresponding to his divine election to be ruler over Israel." &#1489;&#1490;&#1489; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, and they were among the heroes, i.e., belonged to the heroes, the helpers of the war, i.e., to those who helped him in his former wars; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-17.htm">1 Chronicles 12:17</a>., 21f.</body></html>
