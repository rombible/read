The term for “God” (Elohim) has probably fallen out of the Heb. ext. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm" title="And the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said to them, Thus said God, Why transgress you the commandments of the LORD, that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.">2Chronicles 24:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Judges 6:34</a>.) We, in these days, may word it differently, and say, Under a sudden impulse of enthusiasm, Amasai exclaimed, &c. But if we look deeper, and seek a definite interpretation of our terms, we shall allow that the impulses of spirit are spiritual, and that enthusiasm for truth and right is indeed a sort of divine possession. The Syriac renders: “The spirit of valour clothed Amasai.” Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>.) The spirit of Jehovah is the source of true courage, as of all other spiritual gifts.<p><span class= "bld">Amasai.</span>—Perhaps the same as Amasa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Abigail bore Amasa: and the father of Amasa was Jether the Ishmeelite.">1Chronicles 2:17</a>), son of Abigail, David’s sister, whom Joab murdered out of jealousy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.">2Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/20-4.htm" title="Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be you here present.">2Samuel 20:4-10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Chief of the captains.</span>—The Heb. text reads, “head of the Thirty,” with which the LXX., Svr., and Vulg. agree. The Heb. margin (Qri) has “knights,” or “chariot-soldiers” (Authorised Version, “captains”), which is less probable. Amasai’s name is not given in the catalogue of the Thirty (1 Chronicles 11), and he is here called “chief of the Thirty” by anticipation.<p><span class= "bld">Thine are we, David.</span>—The structure of Amasaľs inspired utterance is poetical—<p>“To thee, David!<p>And with thee, son of Ishai!<p>Peace, peace to thee.<p>And peace to thine helper;<p>For thy God hath holpen thee!<p><span class= "bld">On thy side.</span>—Heb., with thee.

Amasai answers, We will be fast friends with thee, and with all who befriend thee, because God is on thy side. (Comp, the usual Oriental greeting, Salãm ‘alaikum—Peace to you!)

From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act.

Their anticipations, as the result showed, were well founded. He did suspect them, but the doubts of David as to their object in repairing to him, were promptly dispelled by Amasai or Amasa, who, by the secret impulse of the Spirit, assured him of their strong attachment and their zealous service from a unanimous conviction that his cause was owned and blessed of God (1Sa 18:12-14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Spirit came upon Amasai; </span> not only saving graces, but other heroical and generous motions, are ascribed to God’s Spirit, which here stirred up in him a more than ordinary greatness and presentness of mind and resolution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy God helpeth thee; </span> we have observed God’s singular and gracious care of thee, and kindness to thee, and if we should oppose thee, we should be fighters against God and his word and providence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Captains of the band, </span> i. e. of those forces which they brought with them.

If we compare the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22-24</a>, we learn that David at that time did not hide himself in one single definite mountain-fortress, but sought and found resting-places, now here, now there, in the wilderness, on the summits of the hills (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>); so that &#1502;&#1510;&#1491; here is to be understood, as &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3</a>, also is, generally of the fastnesses in the mountains of Judah. At that time there gathered round David a great company of discontented and oppressed men, to the number of about 400, - men dissatisfied with Saul's rule, whose leader he became, and who soon amounted to 600 men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>).
