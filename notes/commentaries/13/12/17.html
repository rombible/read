From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the danger of the exploit, see the marginal reference note.<p>This passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8-15</a> seems to be taken verbatim from an ancient source, the poetical expressions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-14.htm">1 Chronicles 12:14</a>, being especially unlike the usual style of our author. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. the children of Benjamin and Judah&#8212;It is probable that the Benjamites invited the Judahites to accompany them, in order to prevent David being suspicious of them. Their anticipations, as the result showed, were well founded. He did suspect them, but the doubts of David as to their object in repairing to him, were promptly dispelled by Amasai or Amasa, who, by the secret impulse of the Spirit, assured him of their strong attachment and their zealous service from a unanimous conviction that his cause was owned and blessed of God (1Sa 18:12-14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And answered, </span> i. e. spake, as that word is oft used in Scripture, even of him that speaketh first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Mine heart shall be knit unto you; </span> I shall ever esteem and love you, and show this by my actions to you hereafter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If ye be come to betray me to mine enemies; </span> which your number, and quality, and near relation to Saul gives me some cause to suspect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">There is no wrong in mine hands; </span> I have done no injury to Saul, nor to you; but have spared him and you when it was in my power to have destroyed you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it, </span> to wit, by his hand and power manifested for me and against you for your perfidiousness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David went out to meet them,....

If we compare the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22-24</a>, we learn that David at that time did not hide himself in one single definite mountain-fortress, but sought and found resting-places, now here, now there, in the wilderness, on the summits of the hills (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>); so that &#1502;&#1510;&#1491; here is to be understood, as &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3</a>, also is, generally of the fastnesses in the mountains of Judah. At that time there gathered round David a great company of discontented and oppressed men, to the number of about 400, - men dissatisfied with Saul's rule, whose leader he became, and who soon amounted to 600 men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>). To these belong the Gadites, and the men out of Benjamin and Judah, whose adhesion to David is noticed in our verses. &#1504;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, they separated themselves from the other Gadites who were on Saul's side, "strong heroes," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>; cf. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-24.htm">1 Chronicles 5:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-2.htm">1 Chronicles 7:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-9.htm">1 Chronicles 7:9</a>, etc. &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, men for service in the host for the war, i.e., combatants practised in war. &#1493;&#1512;&#1502;&#1495; &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;, preparing shield and spear, i.e., wielding shield and spear, practised in their use: the preparing of these weapons includes the handling of them.

Lions' faces their faces, i.e., lion-like in appearance, thoroughly warlike figures; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>. "As roes running swiftly on the mountains;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>. This description of the strength and swiftness of these warriors recalls, as Bertheau remarks, the similar expressions used in the historical books concerning heroes of David's time. It has manifestly been drawn from the original documents, not added by the chronicler. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-9.htm">1 Chronicles 12:9-13</a> the names are enumerated individually. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, at the end of a series of ordinal numbers, denotes the eleventh; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-12.htm">1 Chronicles 24:12</a>. </body></html>
