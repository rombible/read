Happy are those who wisely perceive it to be their duty and interest, to submit to the Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of David; who renounce for his sake all that is not consistent; whose earnest endeavours to do good are directed by the wisdom that God giveth, through acquaintance with his word, experience, and observation. If any man lack this wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Expert in war ... - Rather "arrayed for battle with all harness of battle, who set the battle in array with no double heart," excelling, that is, in the matter of their arms and accoutrements.

The infinitive &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;&#1512; is substantially a continuation of the preceding participles, but grammatically is dependent on &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; understood (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>). Cf. as to this free use of the infinitive with &#1500;, Ew. 351, c. The signification of the verb &#1506;&#1491;&#1512;, which occurs only here (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-33.htm">1 Chronicles 12:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>), is doubtful. According to the lxx and the Vulg. (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, venerunt in auxilium), and nine MSS, which read &#1500;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;, we would be inclined to take &#1506;&#1491;&#1512; for the Aramaic form of the Hebrew &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; (cf. Arabic &#8219;dr), to help; but that meaning does not suit &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>. Its connection there demands that &#1506;&#1491;&#1512; should signify "to close up together," to set in order the battle array; and so here, closing up together with not double heart, i.e., with whole or stedfast heart (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>), animo integro et firmo atque concordi; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a> (Mich.). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a> we have a comprehensive statement; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which refers to all the bodies of men enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-24.htm">1 Chronicles 12:24-37</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; defectively written; and as it occurs only here, it may be perhaps a mere orthographical error. The whole of the remainder of Israel who did not go to Hebron were &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; er, of one, i.e., of united heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-12.htm">2 Chronicles 30:12</a>): they had a unanimous wish to make David king.</body></html>
