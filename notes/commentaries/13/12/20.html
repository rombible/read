No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Amasai - The marginal reference identifies him with Amasa, David's nephew, but it seems unlikely that David would have misdoubted a band led by his own nephew.<p>The passionate earnestness of Amasai's speech is strongly marked in the original, and will be better seen by omitting the words which our Version adds in italics.

As he went to Ziklag&#8212;If those Manassites joined him on his return to Ziklag, after his dismissal from the Philistine army, then their arrival took place before the battle of Gilboa could have been fought (compare 1Sa 29:11). Convinced of the desperate state of Saul's affairs, they abandoned him, and resolved to transfer their allegiance to David.

Seven is the number also of Eastern Manasseh mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-24.htm">1 Chronicles 5:24</a>. Nothing is now said of the men belonging to them joining with them. <span class="cmt_word">Jozabad</span>. One manuscript quoted by Kennicott has for this name on its first occurrence Jechabar. It is scarcely likely that the same name should appear twice in this short list, without some qualifying mark being put to one of the two. Nothing else is known of these seven cap-talus of the thousands of Manasseh. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, heads of the war-host, i.e., chief warriors, not leaders of the host. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, "one for a hundred, (viz.) the small and the greater for a thousand," i.e., the smaller (weaker) could cope with a hundred, the stronger with a thousand men; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>. This, which is the only correct interpretation, is that received by Bertheau and the older Jewish commentators. The Vulgate, on the contrary, translates, novissimus centum militibus praeerat et maximus mille, which is inadmissible, for in that case &#1506;&#1500; must have been used instead of &#1500;. The &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; belongs to both the clauses which it precedes, to &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; and to &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;, and is placed immediately before &#1500;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492; to emphasize the contrast between one and a hundred. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-15.htm">1 Chronicles 12:15</a> we have a proof of their valour, in an account of a bold exploit performed by them. In the first month of the year, that is, in spring, when the Jordan overflows all its banks, they crossed the river and put to flight all the dwellers in the valleys towards the east and towards the west. This happened, probably, when they separated themselves from their brethren and went over to David, when they must have had to cut their way through the adherents of Saul (Berth.). The Piel &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; with &#1506;&#1500; denotes to make full, to make to run over, in the signification to overflow. The Kethibh &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; comes from &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492; elsewhere only the plural &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, so also here in the Keri. In the dry summer season the Jordan may be crossed by wading at various points (fords); while in spring, on the contrary, when it is so swollen by the melting snows of Lebanon, that in some parts it overflows its banks, it is very dangerous to attempt to cross. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>. &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, "the valleys," for the inhabitants of the valleys. </body></html>
