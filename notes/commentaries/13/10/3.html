The verb is properly to writhe, travail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-4.htm" title="Be you ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.">Isaiah 23:4</a>). Saul’s deadly terror was natural. He believed himself forsaken of God, and stood now, after a lost battle, beset by murderous foes, whom he could not reach. There was no chance of a fair hand to hand encounter. The Heb. word for “archers” is the same in both places in Sam. (<span class= "ital">môrîm</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> here a rarer form (<span class= "ital">yôrîm,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-23.htm" title="And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.">2Chronicles 35:23</a>) fills the second place. The Philistines were from Egypt, and the bow was a favourite Egyptian arm. The hieroglyph for “soldier” (<span class= "ital">menfat</span>) is a man with bow and quiver.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-14 The death of Saul. - The design chiefly in view in these books of the Chronicles, appears to be to preserve the records of the house of David. Therefore the writer repeats not the history of Saul's reign, but only of his death, by which a way was made for David to the throne. And from the ruin of Saul, we may learn, 1. That the sin of sinners will certainly find them out, sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man's greatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3. Disobedience is a killing thing. Saul died for not keeping the word of the Lord. May be delivered from unbelief, impatience, and despair. By waiting on the Lord we shall obtain a kingdom that cannot be moved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The present chapter contains two facts not found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-13</a> - the fastening of Saul's head in the temple of Dagon <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>, and the burial of his bones, and those of his sons, under an oak <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-12.htm">1 Chronicles 10:12</a>.

He was not wounded, at least not dangerously, when he resolved on committing suicide.

The literal translation would be, <span class="accented">the shooters</span>, <span class="accented">men with the bow</span>, <span class="accented">found him.</span> The context makes it plain that the meaning is that the arrows of the pursuers rather than the pursuers themselves "found" him, and these made him argue all the rest. To this our Authorized Version has jumped by the one word "hit" him. It is evident from ver. 8 that the Philistines did not find the body of Saul to recognize it till next day. <span class="cmt_word">And he was wounded of the archers</span>. The radical meaning of the verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>) is rather "to twist" (<span class="accented">torquere</span>) or "be twisted," "writhe" (<span class="accented">torqueri</span>). And the meaning here is in harmony with it, that Saul trembled from fear or writhed with the pain already inflicted of the arrows. Hence the parallel passage couples with this same verb, the adverb <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5da;</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The family of King Saul. - This register has already occurred in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29-38</a>, along with those of other families of the tribe of Benjamin, and is repeated here only to connect the following history of the kingship with the preceding genealogical lists. It forms here the introduction to the narrative of Saul's death in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-1.htm">1 Chronicles 10:1-14</a>, which in turn forms the transition to the kingship of David. The deviations of this register from that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29-38</a>, show that it has been derived from another document in more complete preservation than that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8.htm">1 Chronicles 8</a>, which had been handed down in connection with other genealogies of the Benjamite families, and had suffered considerably in its text.
