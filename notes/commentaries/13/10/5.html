Therefore the writer repeats not the history of Saul's reign, but only of his death, by which a way was made for David to the throne. And from the ruin of Saul, we may learn, 1. That the sin of sinners will certainly find them out, sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man's greatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3. Disobedience is a killing thing. Saul died for not keeping the word of the Lord. May be delivered from unbelief, impatience, and despair. By waiting on the Lord we shall obtain a kingdom that cannot be moved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The present chapter contains two facts not found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-13</a> - the fastening of Saul's head in the temple of Dagon <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>, and the burial of his bones, and those of his sons, under an oak <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-12.htm">1 Chronicles 10:12</a>.
