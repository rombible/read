Therefore the writer repeats not the history of Saul's reign, but only of his death, by which a way was made for David to the throne. And from the ruin of Saul, we may learn, 1. That the sin of sinners will certainly find them out, sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man's greatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3. Disobedience is a killing thing. Saul died for not keeping the word of the Lord. May be delivered from unbelief, impatience, and despair. By waiting on the Lord we shall obtain a kingdom that cannot be moved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The present chapter contains two facts not found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-13</a> - the fastening of Saul's head in the temple of Dagon <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>, and the burial of his bones, and those of his sons, under an oak <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-12.htm">1 Chronicles 10:12</a>.

One function of an armourbearer was to give the “coup de grâce” to fallen enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-13.htm" title="And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer slew after him.">1 Samuel 14:13</a>), but sometimes the same office had to be executed for friends.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and abuse me</span>] i.e. wreak their cruel will upon me; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-6.htm" title="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Jdg 1:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a sword</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">his sword</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And abuse me</span>. The main idea of the Hithp. of the verb here used is to <span class="accented">satisfy the</span> thirst of lust or cruelty. Saul probably feared not the abuse of mocking only, but that of torture. In the corresponding passage this verb is preceded by the clause, <span class="cmt_word">and thrust me through. His armour-bearer would not</span>. He refused the request or bidding of Saul, no doubt mainly in respect of the fact that Saul was still "the anointed." We have a full description of both the loose arms and of the armour of the body in the case of the Philistine Goliath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4-7</a>). It is one of the world's surprising facts that the making of arms and armour, and the acquiring of skill in the using of them, should, as in fact all history attests, date from so early a period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-26.htm">Genesis 31:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>). As compared with the history and the fragmentary re. mains of classical antiquity, those of Scripture are remarkably scanty on this subject. The sword is the earliest mentioned in Scripture, carried in a <span class="accented">sheath</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-27.htm">1 Chronicles 21:27</a>); though the Hebrew word is here different from that used in Samuel. It was slung by a <span class="accented">girdle</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>), rested on <span class="accented">hips</span> or <span class="accented">thigh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-16.htm">Judges 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>), and was sometimes "two-edged" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-16.htm">Judges 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>). Then follows the spear in several varieties, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-9.htm">1 Chronicles 23:9</a>.

Again as a <span class="accented">lancet</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-12.htm">2 Chronicles 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-9.htm">Ezekiel 39:9</a>). In addition to these three chief varieties of spear - the spear proper, the javelin, end the lancet - there is mention of two other weapons used at all events as the dart of a light kind would be used, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-10.htm">2 Chronicles 23:10</a>, and elsewhere, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>, respectively. After sword and spear rank the bow and arrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-20.htm">Genesis 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>) And lastly, the sling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-29.htm">1 Samuel 25:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-25.htm">2 Kings 3:25</a>), and a very strong weapon of the same kind mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>. The chief articles worn as bodily armour were the breastplate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5, 38</a>); the somewhat obscure habergeon, mentioned only twice, in no connection then of battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-32.htm">Exodus 28:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-23.htm">Exodus 39:23</a>), the original name of which, <span class="accented">tacharah</span>, is found on Egyptian papyri of the nineteenth dynasty, - it seems to have been a species of doublet or corselet; the helmet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5</a>; ch. 26:14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>); greaves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-6.htm">1 Samuel 17:6</a>); two kinds of shield (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7, 41</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>); and lastly the article mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-9.htm">2 Chronicles 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>; and of which we can say nothing certainly bearing upon its nature or its use, except that it was made of gold.
