It is mere pedantry to press the phrases “all his men,” “all his house.” The strength of these expressions indicates the completeness of the overthrow.<p>The chronicler was fully aware that some of Saul’s house were not engaged in this battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm" title="And in Gibeon dwelled the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:">1Chronicles 9:35</a>).

Therefore the writer repeats not the history of Saul's reign, but only of his death, by which a way was made for David to the throne. And from the ruin of Saul, we may learn, 1. That the sin of sinners will certainly find them out, sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man's greatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3. Disobedience is a killing thing. Saul died for not keeping the word of the Lord. May be delivered from unbelief, impatience, and despair. By waiting on the Lord we shall obtain a kingdom that cannot be moved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All his house died together - Not the whole of his family, nor even "all his sons" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6-15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-1.htm">2 Samuel 4:1-12</a>).

In place of these words, the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6</a>) has, "And his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together." This reading avoids the ambiguity referred to already (ver. 2). In either passage the moral is plain, that the end and ruin of Saul's family as a whole had arrived, rather than literally that the whole, including every member, of that family had perished. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The family of King Saul. - This register has already occurred in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29-38</a>, along with those of other families of the tribe of Benjamin, and is repeated here only to connect the following history of the kingship with the preceding genealogical lists. It forms here the introduction to the narrative of Saul's death in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-1.htm">1 Chronicles 10:1-14</a>, which in turn forms the transition to the kingship of David. The deviations of this register from that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29-38</a>, show that it has been derived from another document in more complete preservation than that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8.htm">1 Chronicles 8</a>, which had been handed down in connection with other genealogies of the Benjamite families, and had suffered considerably in its text.
