For this reason, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20-30</a> the tribal princes of the Seirite inhabitants of the land are noticed; and in our chapter also, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-38.htm">1 Chronicles 1:38</a>, the names of these seven &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-39.htm">1 Chronicles 1:39-42</a> of their sons (eighteen men and one woman, Timna), are enumerated, where only Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, also mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-25.htm">Genesis 36:25</a>, is omitted. The names correspond, except in a few unimportant points, which have been already discussed in the Commentary on Genesis. The inhabitants of Mount Seir consisted, then, after the immigration of Esau and his descendants, of twenty tribes under a like number of phylarchs, thirteen of whom were Edomite, of the family of Esau, and seven Seirite, who are called in the Chronicle &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and in Genesis &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;, Troglodytes, inhabitants of the land, that is, aborigines.<p>If we glance over the whole posterity of Abraham as they are enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-28.htm">1 Chronicles 1:28-42</a>, we see that it embraces (a) his sons Ishmael and Isaac, and Isaac's sons Israel and Esau (together 4 persons); (b) the sons of Ishmael, or the tribes descended from Ishmael (12 names); (c) the sons and grandsons of Keturah (13 persons or chiefs); (d) the thirteen phylarchs descended from Esau; (e) the seven Seirite phylarchs, and eighteen grandsons and a granddaughter of Seir (26 persons). We have thus in all the names of sixty-eight persons, and to them we must add Keturah, and Timna the concubine of Eliphaz, before we get seventy persons. But these seventy must not by any means be reckoned as seventy tribes, which is the result Bertheau arrives at by means of strange calculations and errors in numbers.<p>(Note: That the Chronicle gives no countenance to this view appears from Bertheau's calculation of the 70 tribes: from Ishmael, 12; from Keturah, 13; from Isaac, 2; from Esau, 5 sons and 7 grandchildren of Eliphaz (Timna, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-36.htm">1 Chronicles 1:36</a>, being included in the number), and 4 grandsons by Reuel - 16 in all; from Seir 7 sons, and from these 20 other descendants, 27 in all, which makes the sum of 70. But the biblical text mentions only 19 other descendants of Seir, so that only 26 persons came from Seir, and the sum is therefore 12 + 13 + 2 + 16 + 26  equals  69. But we must also object to other points in Bertheau's reckoning: (1) the arbitrary change of Timna into a grandchild of Esau; (2) the arbitrary reckoning of Esau and Israel ( equals  Jacob) without Ishmael. Was Esau, apart from his sons, the originator of a people? Had the author of the Chronicle cherished the purpose attributed to him by Bertheau, of bringing the lists of names handed down by tradition to the round or significant number 70, he would certainly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-33.htm">1 Chronicles 1:33</a> not have omitted the three peoples descended from Dedan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>), as he might by these names have completed the number 70 without further trouble.)<p>Upon this conclusion he founds his hypothesis, that as the three branches of the family of Noah are divided into seventy peoples (which, as we have seen before is not the case), so also the three branches of the family of Abraham are divided into seventy tribes; and in this again he finds a remarkable indication "that even in the time of the chronicler, men sought by means of numbers to bring order and consistency into the lists of names handed down by tradition from the ancient times." </body></html>
