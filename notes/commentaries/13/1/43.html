These ten (6 + 4) grandsons of Esau were, with his three sons by Aholibamah (Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35</a>), the founders of the thirteen tribes of the posterity of Esau. They are called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15</a> &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;, heads of tribes (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;) of the children of Esau, i.e., of the Edomites, but are all again enumerated, Gen. 3615-19, singly.<p>(Note: The erroneous statement of Bertheau, therefore, that "according to Genesis the Edomite people was also divided into twelve tribes, five tribes from Eliphaz, four tribes from Reuel, and the three tribes which were referred immediately to Aholibamah the wife of Esau. It is distinctly stated that Amalek was connected with these twelve tribes only very loosely, for he appears as the son of the concubine of Eliphaz," - must be in so far corrected, that neither the Chronicle nor Genesis knows anything of the twelve tribes of the Edomites. Both books, on the contrary, mention thirteen grandsons of Esau, and these thirteen grandsons are, according to the account of Genesis, the thirteen phylarchs of the Edomite people, who are distributed according to the three wives of Esau; so that the thirteen families may be grouped together in three tribes. Nor is Amalek connected only in a loose way with the other tribes in Genesis: he is, on the contrary, not only included in the number of the sons of Adah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>, probably because Timna stood in the same relationship to Adah the wife of Esau as Hagar held to Sarah, but also is reckoned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-16.htm">Genesis 36:16</a> among the Allufim of the sons of Eliphaz. Genesis therefore enumerates not five but six tribes from Eliphaz; and the chronicler has not "completely obliterated the twelvefold division," as Bertheau further maintains, but the thirteen sons and grandsons of Esau who became phylarchs are all introduced; and the only thing which is omitted in reference to them is the title &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;, it being unnecessary in a genealogical enumeration of the descendants of Esau.) </body></html>
