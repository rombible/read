When compared with other places, there are some differences found; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless God that the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The original of the Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that God created, and is thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, and absurd origins assigned to other nations. But the nations now are all so mingled with one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Only this we are sure of, that God has created of one blood all nations of men; they are all descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us?

Ararat being Armenia, and Minni (= Mannai of the Assyrian monuments) being a neighbour of Armenia, Ashkenaz also is probably a neighbour of Armenia and to be sought on the N. or E. of Cappadocia, the seat of its “father” Gomer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Riphath</span>] so LXX. and Vulg.

"And ate continually before him all his life," i.e., ate at the king's table (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a>). Moreover a daily ration of food was supplied to him by the king for the maintenance of his retainers, who formed his little court.

At the same time, we cannot infer from this with any certainty that Jehoiachin died before Evil-merodach; for the favour shown to him might be continued by Evil-merodach's successor. We cannot make any safe conjecture as to the motives which induced Evil-merodach to pardon Jehoiachin and confer this distinction upon him. The higher ground of this joyful termination of his imprisonment lay in the gracious decree of God, that the seed of David, though severely chastised for its apostasy from the Lord, should not be utterly rejected (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14-15</a>). At the same time, this event was also intended as a comforting sign to the whole of the captive people, that the Lord would one day put an end to their banishment, if they would acknowledge that it was a well-merited punishment for this sins that they had been driven away from before His face, and would turn again to the Lord their God with all their heart.</body></html>
