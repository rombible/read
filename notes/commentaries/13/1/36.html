The best explanation is, that the writer has in his mind rather the tribes descended from Eliphaz than his actual children, and as there was a place, Timna, inhabited by his "dukes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-51.htm">1 Chronicles 1:51</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-40.htm">Genesis 35:40</a>), he puts the race which lived there among his "sons." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. sons of Eliphaz&#8212;the tribe Adites, in the center country of the Saracens, so called from his mother, Adah (Ge 36:10).<p>Teman&#8212;gave rise to the land of Teman, near the head of the Red Sea.<p>Omar&#8212;the tribe Beni-Amma, settled at the northern point of Djebel Shera (Mount Seir).<p>Zephi&#8212;the tribe Dzaf.<p>Gatam&#8212;Katam, inhabited by the tribe Al Saruat, or "people of Sarah."<p>Kenaz&#8212;the tribe Aenezes, a tribe whose settlement lies in the neighborhood of Syria.<p>Amalek&#8212;the Beni Malak of Zohran, and the Beni Maledj of the Shat el Arab.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Timna:</span> there is another Timna, the concubine of Eliphaz, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm" title="And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.">Genesis 36:12</a></span>, but this was one of his sons, though called by the same name; there being some names common both to men and women in the Hebrew and in other languages. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The sons of Esau,....

From this Bertheau wrongly concludes that the chronicler probably did not find these names in his copy of the Pentateuch. The reason of the omission is rather this, that in Genesis the great-grandchildren are not themselves mentioned, but only the tribes descended from the grandchildren, while the chronicler wished to enumerate only the sons and grandsons.
