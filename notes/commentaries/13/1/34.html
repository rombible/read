It breaks again at once into two, <span class="cmt_word">Esau</span>, the less important, treated of first; and <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span>, reserved till we enter on ch. 2. Of <span class="accented">Esau</span>, the names of five sons are given; and of seven grandsons by the first in order, and four grandsons by the second in order of these sons. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1-5</a> we have the names of the five sons of Esau, which correspond in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text exactly with those of this list. We have there in addition the names of their mothers respectively, who were "daughters of Canaan," Adah of the Hittites, mother of the first; Bashamath of the Ishmaelites, mother of the second (and by these two lines came the seven and four grandsons); and Aholibamah of the Hivites, mother of the remaining three sons. The names correspond also in the Septuagint in the two places, with the minute differences of Eliphaz and Ieoul here, for <span class="accented">Eliphas</span> and <span class="accented">Ieous</span> there. Then follow the names of seven grandsons of Esau though his son <span class="cmt_word">Eliphaz</span>, of whom the first five are found and in agreement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>), with the exception of <span class="cmt_word">Zephi</span> here for Zepho there, both in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text. But the sixth name here, Timna, is explained in Genesis as the name of a concubine of Eliphaz, by whom he had the son <span class="cmt_word">Amalek</span>, who appears here as the seventh son. There can be no doubt that we come here upon a transcriber's error, and it would be easily amended if we read "and by Timna, Amalek," <span class="accented">vice</span> "and Timna and Amalek." If this be the correct account of the matter, the grandsons of Esau of course count one fewer here. These two names also tally in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text in the two places; while for all seven names the agreement in the Septuagint is exact, except that we read Gootham here for Gothom there. There remain, in ver. 37, four grandsons to Esau, by Reuel. Their names agree with Genesis in the Authorized Version, in the Hebrew text, and in the Septuagint, except that this last reads <span class="cmt_word">Naches</span> here for Nachoth there. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sons of Abraham. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-28.htm">1 Chronicles 1:28</a> only Isaac and Ishmael are so called; Isaac first, as the son of the promise.
