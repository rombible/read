When compared with other places, there are some differences found; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless God that the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The original of the Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that God created, and is thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, and absurd origins assigned to other nations. But the nations now are all so mingled with one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Only this we are sure of, that God has created of one blood all nations of men; they are all descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us?

On the coincidence of the thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin's imprisonment and the commencement of the reign of Evil-merodach see the remarks at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>. Instead of the 27th day of the month, the 25th is given in Jeremiah, again through the substitution of similar numeral letters (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8</a>).

Ptol., and in other forms also: see M. v. Nieb. Gesch. Ass. p. 42, and Ges. thes. p. 41; compounded from the name of the Babylonian god Merodach (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>) and the prefix Evil, which has not yet been explained with certainty. He reigned two years, according to Berosus in Jos. c. Ap. i. 20, and the Can Ptol.; and according to the verdict of Berosus, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;; and was murdered by his brother-in-law Neriglissor. The statement in Jos. Ant. x. 11, 2, to the effect that he reigned eighteen years, and that of Alex. Polyh. in Euseb. Chr. arm. i. p. 45, that he reigned twelve years, are evidently false.</body></html>
