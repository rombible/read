Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8. Blessed be His name, believers there shall, not in turn, but all together, without interruption, praise him night and day: may the Lord make each of us fit for the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An almost exact repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29-38</a>; and probably intentionally made by the author.

It is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns (Eze 44:2). There being no king then in Israel, this gate would be always shut.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon,....
