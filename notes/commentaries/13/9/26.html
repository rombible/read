The preceding account of the porters or warders seems to terminate with the words. “For in fixed position are they, the four stalwart warders; <span class= "ital">they</span> are the Levites;” that is, <span class= "ital">the</span> Levites <span class= "ital">par excellence.

Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8.

It is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns (Eze 44:2). There being no king then in Israel, this gate would be always shut.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Were in their set office, </span> i. e. these were constantly upon the place, and in the execution of their office, that so they might oversee and direct the inferior porters in their work.
