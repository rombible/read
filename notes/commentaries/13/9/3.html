The next clause, “and some of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh,” is not found in Nehemiah, and nothing further is said in the present chapter concerning these two tribes. But so far from proving the clause to be a figment of the chronicler’s, this fact only indicates that he has chosen to use the ordinary freedom of a compiler in transcribing from the fuller document which supplied him with materials here and in Nehemiah 11. His source dealt with the neighbouring townships as well as Jerusalem; the latter is the sole subject of the chronicler’s extracts here.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-44 Genealogies. - This chapter expresses that one end of recording all these genealogies was, to direct the Jews, when they returned out of captivity, with whom to unite, and where to reside. Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8.

They selected, in some instances, different names, or names which are now different through corruption; and they frequently expressed the genealogies of the same persons differently, both going on the principle of compression by means of omissions, but omitting from their lists different links of the chain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions&#8212;This chapter relates wholly to the first returned exiles. Almost all the names recur in Nehemiah (Ne 11:1-36), although there are differences which will be explained there. The same division of the people into four classes was continued after, as before the captivity; namely, the priests, Levites, natives, who now were called by the common name of Israelites, and the Nethinims (Jos 9:27; Ezr 2:43; 8:20). When the historian speaks of "the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions," he implies that there were others who afterwards returned and settled in possessions not occupied by the first. Accordingly, we read of a great number returning successively under Ezra, Nehemiah, and at a later period. And some of those who returned to the ancient inheritance of their fathers, had lived before the time of the captivity (Ezr 3:12; Hag 2:4, 10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Some of each of these tribes; either such as offered themselves, or such as were chosen by lot: See <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm" title="And the rulers of the people dwelled at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities.">Nehemiah 11:1</a>,2</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin,....

This Meribbaal, who was lame in his feet (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), had a son Micha (&#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-12.htm">2 Samuel 9:12</a> written &#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1488;), of whom came a numerous race. He had four sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-35.htm">1 Chronicles 8:35</a>), and the family of the last-named of these (Ahaz) is traced down, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36-40</a>, through ten generations to the great-grandson of Eshek. First it is traced from Ahaz to Alemeth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36</a>); then through Zimri, brother of this latter, to Binea, by &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;; then further by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; (hisson) to Azel, of whom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-38.htm">1 Chronicles 8:38</a> six sons are enumerated; and finally, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-39.htm">1 Chronicles 8:39</a>, the sons of his brother Eshek are named, and the sons and grandsons of the first-born of this latter are then enumerated. The last two verses are wanting after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-44.htm">1 Chronicles 9:44</a>. The names in the two registers correspond, except at one point, where we cannot get rid of the discrepancy that for &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36</a>) there stands in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-42.htm">1 Chronicles 9:42</a> &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; both times, probably through an error of transcription, by which out of the shortened form &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; there arose &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1491; and &#1512; being interchanged. Besides this, instead of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1506; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-35.htm">1 Chronicles 8:35</a>, we have in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-41.htm">1 Chronicles 9:41</a>, according to the harder pronunciation of the gutturals, &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1506;; and for &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-37.htm">1 Chronicles 8:37</a>, we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-41.htm">1 Chronicles 9:41</a> the longer original form &#1512;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;. Now since Ahaz, whose posterity is traced down to the tenth generation, was descended from Jonathan in the third generation, and his grandfather Mephibosheth was a boy of five years of age at the death of Saul and Jonathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), the grandsons of Ulam, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>, will be the thirteenth generation of Jonathan's descendants. Now Jonathan fell along with Saul in the year 1055 b.c., and consequently this thirteenth generation of Jonathan's descendants lived probably about 700 b.c., i.e., about 100 years before the Babylonian exile; for, according to the analogy of the royal race of David, we cannot reckon more than twenty-five years on an average for each generation.<p>(Note: Bertheau holds a contrary opinion to that given in the text, and thinks that by the numerous sons and grandsons of Ulam the son of Eshek we are brought down to post-exilic times, seeing that if Saul lived about 1080 b.c., and thirty years are reckoned to each one of the thirteen generations (Eshek being a descendant of Saul in the thirteenth generation), Azel and Eshek must have lived about 690 b.c. But this estimate is too high, for we cannot reckon sixty years to Saul and Jonathan from 1080 onwards, since Jonathan fell along with Saul in 1055, and his son Meribbaal was then hardly five years old, and must consequently have been born in 1060. For the following generations, moreover, not more than twenty-five years on an average should be reckoned. That being the case, the children's children of Ulam's sons, who were the twelfth generation of Micha's descendants, may have lived from 760 b.c. onwards, and during this period, from 760 to 700, may have increased to the troop of blooming grandchildren of Ulam mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>. But even supposing that thirty years should be reckoned for each generation, the last-named generation of 150 grandsons and great-grandsons of Ulam would have lived in the period from 660 to 600, i.e., before the exile, or at least before the first great deportation of the people with Jehoiakim in the year 599 b.c.) </body></html>
