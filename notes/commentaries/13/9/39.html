Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8. Blessed be His name, believers there shall, not in turn, but all together, without interruption, praise him night and day: may the Lord make each of us fit for the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An almost exact repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29-38</a>; and probably intentionally made by the author.

It is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns (Eze 44:2). There being no king then in Israel, this gate would be always shut.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon,....

Since the enumeration of the Levites dwelling in Jerusalem in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-14.htm">1 Chronicles 9:14-16</a> began with the Levitic singer families, so here we find that the singers are mentioned in the first subscription, "these are the singers, heads of fathers'-houses of the Levites," with an additional remark as to their service: "In the cells free, for day and night it is incumbent upon them to be in service," which is somewhat obscure. &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;, in later Hebrew, let loose, set free. Rashi and Kimchi have already translated it, immunes ab aliis nempe ministeriis, or ab omni alio officio. Adopting this linguistically assured translation, we must supply with &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;, dwelling or waiting in the cells of the courts of the temple, freed from every other business in order that they may apply themselves wholly to their service, for they are wholly busied therewith day and night. Day and night is not to be pressed, but signifies perpetually, continually. Bertheau translates &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, "they were over them in the service," i.e., had to take the oversight of the singers subordinate to them. but this can hardly be correct; and the passage quoted to justify this translation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-12.htm">2 Chronicles 34:12</a>, proves nothing, because there &#1502;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; is used along with it. We therefore prefer to take &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; in the signification "it is incumbent upon them," although we should then expect &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492;; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-27.htm">1 Chronicles 9:27</a>. Yet &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; can in this connection quite well be used elliptically or concisely for "to be in service," i.e., to carry on their musical duties. The second subscription (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-34.htm">1 Chronicles 9:34</a>) refers to all the Levites, and is similar in contents and form to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-28.htm">1 Chronicles 8:28</a>. </body></html>
