Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8.

Almost all the names recur in Nehemiah (Ne 11:1-36), although there are differences which will be explained there. The same division of the people into four classes was continued after, as before the captivity; namely, the priests, Levites, natives, who now were called by the common name of Israelites, and the Nethinims (Jos 9:27; Ezr 2:43; 8:20). When the historian speaks of "the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions," he implies that there were others who afterwards returned and settled in possessions not occupied by the first. Accordingly, we read of a great number returning successively under Ezra, Nehemiah, and at a later period. And some of those who returned to the ancient inheritance of their fathers, had lived before the time of the captivity (Ezr 3:12; Hag 2:4, 10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Nine hundred and fifty and six:</span> they are reckoned but nine hundred and twenty-eight in <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-8.htm" title="And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.">Nehemiah 11:8</a></span>, either because there he mentions only those that were by lot determined to dwell at Jerusalem, to whom he here adds those who freely offered themselves to it; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm" title="And the rulers of the people dwelled at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities.">Nehemiah 11:1</a>,2</span>; or because some of the persons and families first placed there were dead or extinguished, or else removed from Jerusalem upon some emergent occasion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred amd fifty and six,....

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11.htm">Nehemiah 11</a>, consequently, we have a register of the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, while our chapter contains only a register of the former inhabitants of Jerusalem. Only in so far as it treats of the inhabitants of Jerusalem does Nehemiah's register resemble ours in plan; that is, to this extent, that the sons of Judah, the sons of Benjamin, priests and Levites, are enumerated seriatim as dwelling in Jerusalem, that is, that heads of the fathers'-houses of these inhabitants, as is stated by Nehemiah in the superscription <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-3.htm">1 Chronicles 11:3</a>, and in our chapter, at the end of the respective paragraphs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-9.htm">1 Chronicles 9:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-13.htm">1 Chronicles 9:13</a>, and in the subscription, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-33.htm">1 Chronicles 9:33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-34.htm">1 Chronicles 9:34</a>.<p>But if we examine the contents of the two catalogues more minutely, their agreement is shown by the identity of several of the names of these heads. On this point Bertheau thus speaks: "Of the three heads of Judah, Uthai, Asaiah, and Jeuel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-4.htm">1 Chronicles 9:4-6</a>, we recognise the first two in Athaiah and Maaseiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-4.htm">Nehemiah 11:4-5</a>; only the third name, Jeuel, is omitted. Of the five heads of Benjamin, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-5.htm">1 Chronicles 9:5-7</a>, it is true, we meet with only two, Sallu and Hodaviah, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-7.htm">Nehemiah 11:7-9</a>; but it is manifest that there was no intention to communicate in that place a complete enumeration of the hereditary chiefs of Benjamin. The names of the six heads of the divisions of the priests, Jedaiah and Jehoiarib, Jachin, Azariah (Seriah occupies his place in the book of Nehemiah), Adaiah and Maasiai (represented in Nehemiah by Amashai), are enumerated in both places in the same order. Among the Levites there occur the names of Shemaiah and Mattaniah as representatives of the great Levitic divisions of Merari and Gershon-Asaph, and we easily recognise our &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492; in the &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488; of the book of Nehemiah. Only the two first of the four chiefs of the doorkeepers, Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, and Ahiman, are named in the abridged enumeration of the book of Nehemiah, while the two others are only referred to in the added &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;." Now, even according to this statement of the matter, the difference is seen to be almost as great as the agreement; but in reality, as a more exact comparison of the catalogues shows, the true state of the case is very different. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a>, there dwelt in Jerusalem also sons of Ephraim and Manasseh; but the catalogue from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-4.htm">1 Chronicles 9:4</a> onwards contains only sons of Judah and Benjamin, and not a single Ephraimite or Manassite. The reason of that is probably this, that only single families and individuals from among the latter dwelt there, while the register only makes mention of the heads of the larger family groups in the population of Jerusalem. </body></html>
