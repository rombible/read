Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8.

The words of the first clause refer to Shallum, and imply that, whereas Shallum (or his house) had originally the general superintendence of the temple gates, a change had been made when the author wrote, and Shallum's charge had become the east gate only. The second clause means; "these were the porters in those fixed stations at the outer gates of the Temple, which corresponded to the camp stations of the Levites who guarded the tabernacle in the early times." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. the king's gate&#8212;The king had a gate from his palace into the temple (2Ki 16:18), which doubtless was kept constantly closed except for the monarch's use; and although there was no king in Israel on the return from the captivity, yet the old ceremonial was kept up, probably in the hope that the scepter would, ere long, be restored to the house of David. It is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns (Eze 44:2).

There also dwelt there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a>) Azariah the son of Hilkiah, etc., the prince of the house of God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-13.htm">2 Chronicles 31:13</a>. This is the Azariah mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-13.htm">1 Chronicles 6:13</a>, the son of Hilkiah, etc., the grandfather of the Jehozadak who was led captive into Babylon. then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a> we have two other heads of the priestly fathers'-houses, with an enumeration of their ancestors, through whom they are traced back to the classes of priests to which they belonged respectively, viz., Adaiah to the class Malchijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-9.htm">1 Chronicles 24:9</a>), and Maasiai to the class Immer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-14.htm">1 Chronicles 24:14</a>). According to this, therefore, there dwelt at Jerusalem, of the priesthood, the three classes Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, and Jachin, Azariah the prince of the temple, and of the classes Malchijah and Immer, the fathers'-houses Adaiah and Maasiai. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-13.htm">1 Chronicles 9:13</a> the whole number is estimated at 1760. A difficulty is raised by the first words of this verse, "And their brethren, heads of their fathers'-houses, 1760," which can hardly be taken in any other sense than as denoting that the number of the heads of the fathers'-houses amounted to 1760. This, however, is not conceivable, as "fathers'-houses" are not single households, but larger groups of related families. Moreover, &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, which is co-ordinate with the heads of the fathers'-houses, can only denote, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-6.htm">1 Chronicles 9:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-9.htm">1 Chronicles 9:9</a>, the heads of the families which belonged to or constituted the fathers'-houses. To arrive at this meaning, however, we must transpose the words &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, connecting &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1512; with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>, and &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; with the number, thus: heads of fathers'-houses, etc., were those mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>, and their brethren 1760 (men), valiant heroes in the work of the service of the house of God. Before &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514; one would expect the word &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-12.htm">Nehemiah 11:12</a>, but its presence is not so absolutely necessary as to warrant us in supposing that it has been dropped out, and in inserting it. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514; may be also taken as an accusative of relation, "valiant heroes in reference to the work;" or at most a &#1500; a tso may be supplied before &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;, as it might easily have been omitted by a clerical error after the immediately preceding &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;. On comparing our passage with <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-10.htm">Nehemiah 11:10-14</a>, we find there, if &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a> be altered into &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, the same three classes of priests; but instead of Azariah, Seraiah is prince of the house of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a> : thereafter we have 822 brethren, performing the work of the house (of God). Then follows Adaiah of the class Malchijah (as in the Chronicles), but with the addition, "his brethren 242;" and then Amashai of the class Immer, but with other ancestors than those of the Maasiai of the Chronicles, and with the addition, "and their brethren, valiant heroes, 128;" and finally, Zabdiel Ben Hagdolim as overseer (president over them).<p>The sum of the three numbers is 1192, as contrasted with the 1760 of the Chronicle. </body></html>
