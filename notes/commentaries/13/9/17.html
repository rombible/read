It is clear that the names of the porters likewise represent families or guilds, which had hereditary charge of the Temple gates. In fact, all the Levitical functions appear to have descended in the same families from father to son, like the various civil offices in the Roman empire; and tradition ascribed the entire arrangement to David, the second founder of the national worship.

Almost all the names recur in Nehemiah (Ne 11:1-36), although there are differences which will be explained there. The same division of the people into four classes was continued after, as before the captivity; namely, the priests, Levites, natives, who now were called by the common name of Israelites, and the Nethinims (Jos 9:27; Ezr 2:43; 8:20). When the historian speaks of "the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions," he implies that there were others who afterwards returned and settled in possessions not occupied by the first. Accordingly, we read of a great number returning successively under Ezra, Nehemiah, and at a later period. And some of those who returned to the ancient inheritance of their fathers, had lived before the time of the captivity (Ezr 3:12; Hag 2:4, 10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Porters; </span> whose office it was to keep all the gates of the temple, that no unclean person or thing might enter into it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the porters,....

Their number, stated in ver. 22 as two hundred and twelve, is probably corrected in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a> to one hundred and seventy-two, made up of twenty-four for every week (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-17.htm">1 Chronicles 26:17, 18</a>), "entering on the sabbath" upon their work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4</a>), in rotation for seven weeks, and the four "chief warders."

There also dwelt there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a>) Azariah the son of Hilkiah, etc., the prince of the house of God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-13.htm">2 Chronicles 31:13</a>. This is the Azariah mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-13.htm">1 Chronicles 6:13</a>, the son of Hilkiah, etc., the grandfather of the Jehozadak who was led captive into Babylon. then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a> we have two other heads of the priestly fathers'-houses, with an enumeration of their ancestors, through whom they are traced back to the classes of priests to which they belonged respectively, viz., Adaiah to the class Malchijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-9.htm">1 Chronicles 24:9</a>), and Maasiai to the class Immer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-14.htm">1 Chronicles 24:14</a>). According to this, therefore, there dwelt at Jerusalem, of the priesthood, the three classes Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, and Jachin, Azariah the prince of the temple, and of the classes Malchijah and Immer, the fathers'-houses Adaiah and Maasiai. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-13.htm">1 Chronicles 9:13</a> the whole number is estimated at 1760. A difficulty is raised by the first words of this verse, "And their brethren, heads of their fathers'-houses, 1760," which can hardly be taken in any other sense than as denoting that the number of the heads of the fathers'-houses amounted to 1760. This, however, is not conceivable, as "fathers'-houses" are not single households, but larger groups of related families. Moreover, &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, which is co-ordinate with the heads of the fathers'-houses, can only denote, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-6.htm">1 Chronicles 9:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-9.htm">1 Chronicles 9:9</a>, the heads of the families which belonged to or constituted the fathers'-houses. To arrive at this meaning, however, we must transpose the words &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, connecting &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1512; with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>, and &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; with the number, thus: heads of fathers'-houses, etc., were those mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>, and their brethren 1760 (men), valiant heroes in the work of the service of the house of God. Before &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514; one would expect the word &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-12.htm">Nehemiah 11:12</a>, but its presence is not so absolutely necessary as to warrant us in supposing that it has been dropped out, and in inserting it. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514; may be also taken as an accusative of relation, "valiant heroes in reference to the work;" or at most a &#1500; a tso may be supplied before &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;, as it might easily have been omitted by a clerical error after the immediately preceding &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;. On comparing our passage with <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-10.htm">Nehemiah 11:10-14</a>, we find there, if &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a> be altered into &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, the same three classes of priests; but instead of Azariah, Seraiah is prince of the house of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a> : thereafter we have 822 brethren, performing the work of the house (of God). Then follows Adaiah of the class Malchijah (as in the Chronicles), but with the addition, "his brethren 242;" and then Amashai of the class Immer, but with other ancestors than those of the Maasiai of the Chronicles, and with the addition, "and their brethren, valiant heroes, 128;" and finally, Zabdiel Ben Hagdolim as overseer (president over them).<p>The sum of the three numbers is 1192, as contrasted with the 1760 of the Chronicle. </body></html>
