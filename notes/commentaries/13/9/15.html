Perhaps “son of Heman” has dropped out of the text, as there are two names between Mattaniah and Asaph, Obadiah and Jeduthun. It thus appears that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/9-15.htm" title="And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;">1Chronicles 9:15-16</a> are concerned with the Levitieal choirs; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-33.htm" title="And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night.">1Chronicles 9:33</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Villages of the Netophathites.</span>—Netophah was near Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-26.htm" title="The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, an hundred fourscore and eight.">Nehemiah 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-54.htm" title="The sons of Salma; Bethlehem, and the Netophathites, Ataroth, the house of Joab, and half of the Manahethites, the Zorites.">1Chronicles 2:54</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-44 Genealogies. - This chapter expresses that one end of recording all these genealogies was, to direct the Jews, when they returned out of captivity, with whom to unite, and where to reside. Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8.

Almost all the names recur in Nehemiah (Ne 11:1-36), although there are differences which will be explained there. The same division of the people into four classes was continued after, as before the captivity; namely, the priests, Levites, natives, who now were called by the common name of Israelites, and the Nethinims (Jos 9:27; Ezr 2:43; 8:20). When the historian speaks of "the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions," he implies that there were others who afterwards returned and settled in possessions not occupied by the first. Accordingly, we read of a great number returning successively under Ezra, Nehemiah, and at a later period. And some of those who returned to the ancient inheritance of their fathers, had lived before the time of the captivity (Ezr 3:12; Hag 2:4, 10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah,....
