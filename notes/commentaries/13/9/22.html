Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order.

They were the descendants of those originally selected for the work by David. David's arrangements are here regarded as having had the sanction of Samuel - which would imply that he planned them in the lifetime of Saul, while he was still a fugitive and an outlaw. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. the king's gate&#8212;The king had a gate from his palace into the temple (2Ki 16:18), which doubtless was kept constantly closed except for the monarch's use; and although there was no king in Israel on the return from the captivity, yet the old ceremonial was kept up, probably in the hope that the scepter would, ere long, be restored to the house of David. It is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns (Eze 44:2). There being no king then in Israel, this gate would be always shut.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In their villages; </span> where their usual residence was, and whence they came to Jerusalem in their courses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Did ordain:</span> in the times of the judges there was much disorder and confusion, both in the Jewish state and church, and the Levites came to the tabernacle promiscuously, and as their inclinations or occasions brought them. But Samuel, the best of judges, having some prospect and good hopes of deliverance from their enemies, and of a happy settlement of the Israelitish church and nation, and observing that the Levites were greatly increased he began to think of establishing some order among the Levites in their ministration about the tabernacle. And these intentions of his probably were communicated by him to David, who after Samuel’s death, and his own peaceable settlement in his throne, revived and perfected Samuel’s design, and took care to put it in execution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In their set office, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">in their faith</span>, or <span class="ital">faithfulness</span>, i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This remark does not refer to Shemaiah, who cannot have dwelt at the same time in Jerusalem and in the village of the Netophathite, but to his grandfather or ancestor Elkanah, who is thereby to be distinguished from the other men who bore this name, which often occurs in the family of Kohath. All these men are, according to the analogy of the other names in our register, and according to the express statement of the superscription, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-34.htm">1 Chronicles 9:34</a>, to be regarded as heads of Levitic fathers'-houses, and were probably leaders of the music, since those mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-15.htm">1 Chronicles 9:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-16.htm">1 Chronicles 9:16</a> were descendants of Asaph and Jeduthun, and may therefore with certainty be assumed to have belonged to the Levitic musicians. A confirmation of this supposition is found in the superscription, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-33.htm">1 Chronicles 9:33</a>, inasmuch as the mention of the singers in the first line goes to show that the enumeration of the Levites began with the singers. If we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-15.htm">Nehemiah 11:15-18</a> with our passage, we find that these two, Shemaiah and Mattaniah, are mentioned, and on the whole their forefathers have the same names, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-15.htm">1 Chronicles 9:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>; but between the two we find Shabbethai and Jozabad of the chief of the Levites set over the external service of the house of God. After Mattaniah, who is chief of the Asaphites there also, mention is made of Bakbukiah as the second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, a descendant of Jeduthun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>); according to which, even if we identify Bakbakkar with Bakbukiah, and Abda with Obadiah, the Heresh, Galal, and Berechiah of the Chronicles are wanting in Nehemiah, and instead of these three, only Jozabad is mentioned. </body></html>
