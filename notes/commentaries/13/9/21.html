Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8.

It is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns (Eze 44:2).

This remark does not refer to Shemaiah, who cannot have dwelt at the same time in Jerusalem and in the village of the Netophathite, but to his grandfather or ancestor Elkanah, who is thereby to be distinguished from the other men who bore this name, which often occurs in the family of Kohath. All these men are, according to the analogy of the other names in our register, and according to the express statement of the superscription, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-34.htm">1 Chronicles 9:34</a>, to be regarded as heads of Levitic fathers'-houses, and were probably leaders of the music, since those mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-15.htm">1 Chronicles 9:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-16.htm">1 Chronicles 9:16</a> were descendants of Asaph and Jeduthun, and may therefore with certainty be assumed to have belonged to the Levitic musicians. A confirmation of this supposition is found in the superscription, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-33.htm">1 Chronicles 9:33</a>, inasmuch as the mention of the singers in the first line goes to show that the enumeration of the Levites began with the singers. If we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-15.htm">Nehemiah 11:15-18</a> with our passage, we find that these two, Shemaiah and Mattaniah, are mentioned, and on the whole their forefathers have the same names, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-15.htm">1 Chronicles 9:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>; but between the two we find Shabbethai and Jozabad of the chief of the Levites set over the external service of the house of God. After Mattaniah, who is chief of the Asaphites there also, mention is made of Bakbukiah as the second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, a descendant of Jeduthun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>); according to which, even if we identify Bakbakkar with Bakbukiah, and Abda with Obadiah, the Heresh, Galal, and Berechiah of the Chronicles are wanting in Nehemiah, and instead of these three, only Jozabad is mentioned. </body></html>
