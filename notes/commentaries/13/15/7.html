But the Kohathites, of whom came the priestly family of the Aaronites, had precedence in all respects. To them especially was committed the attendance upon the ark and the bearing of it. Of the six Levitical families mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5-10</a> one only was descended from Gershom, one from Merari, and four (Uriel, Elizaphan, Hebron, and Uzziel) from Kohath. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites&#8212;The children of Aaron were the two priests (1Ch 15:11), Zadok and Abiathar, heads of the two priestly houses of Eleazar and Ithamar, and colleagues in the high priesthood (2Sa 20:25). The Levites were the chiefs of their father's house (1Ch 15:12); four belonging to the Kohathite branch, on whose shoulders the ark was to be borne; namely, Uriel, Shemaiah&#8212;descended from Elizaphan or Elzaphan&#8212;(Ex 6:22), Hebron (Ex 6:18; 1Ch 6:2), and Amminadab from Uzziel (Ex 6:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites. Whose business it was to bear the ark when there was any occasion for it: and from hence to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-10.htm">1 Chronicles 15:10</a> an account is given of the Levites, and their number employed in this affair: <p>of the sons of Kohath; a son of Levi, that is, of his posterity; for his immediate sons, and so those of the rest after mentioned, had been dead ages ago; the principal of those, at this present time, was Uriel, and his kindred, or those of the same family with him, were one hundred and twenty: of those of Merari, another son of Levi, the chief was Asaiah, with two hundred and twenty of his relations: of those of Gershon, another son of Levi, was Joel, and his brethren were one hundred and thirty: of the posterity of Elizaphan, a grandson of Kohath, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-18.htm">Exodus 5:18</a>, the most noted was Shemaiah, who had two hundred of his family with him: and of those of Hebron, the son of Kohath, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>, Eliel was the most famous, and he had eighty of his kindred with him: and of those of Uzziel, another son of Kohath in a different line from Elizaphan, who also was a son of Uzziel, was Amminadab the chief, who had one hundred and twelve of his kindred with him: the number of Levites, in all, gathered together, were eight hundred and sixty two, besides their chiefs. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a> the whole matter is introduced by a statement that the motive which had determined the king to bring the ark to Jerusalem, was his having heard of the blessing which the ark had brought upon the house of Obed-edom. In our narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-1.htm">1 Chronicles 15:1</a>), the remark that David, while building his house in Jerusalem, prepared a place for the ark of God, and erected a tent for it, forms the transition from the account of his palace-building (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>.) to the bringing in of the ark. The words, "he made unto himself houses," do not denote, as Bertheau thinks, the building of other houses besides the palaces built with the help of King Hiram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>). For &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not synonymous with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, but expresses the preparation of the building for a dwelling, and the words refer to the completion of the palace as a dwelling-place for the king and his wives and children. In thus making the palace which had been built fit for a habitation, David prepared a place for the ark, which, together with its tent, was to be placed in his palace. As to the reasons which influenced David in determining to erect a new tabernacle for the ark, instead of causing the old and sacred tabernacle to be brought from Gibeon to Jerusalem for the purpose, see the remarks introductory to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>. </body></html>
