The fabric of them was different; the ephod was made of gold, blue, purple, scarlet; whereas the robe was formed all of blue. The shape of them was different; the ephod reaching only to the knees, the robe flowing down even to the very covering of the feet. The robe had no division in it throughout, but was made whole and round, with an opening in the middle of it, at the top; so that it was impossible any part of the body could be seen through it, especially as the ephod, on this occasion of David’s dancing, was thrown over it, and tied, probably, with a girdle, as the priest’s ephod always was. David clothed himself with these linen garments on this solemnity, both out of reverence to God, and for convenience, because they were cooler. It may be further observed, that this robe was worn by kings, their children, princes, priests, Levites, and prophets, when they appeared on any solemn occasion, and it covered their other garments: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-14.htm" title="And he said to her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle.

And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.">2 Samuel 13:8</a>. David, therefore, dressed himself on this occasion with this long, flowing linen robe, instead of the robe of state proper to him as king of Israel, and which was made of richer materials; and hence he was scornfully insulted by Saul’s daughter, as uncovering himself as a king, and appearing in a habit wholly unworthy, as she thought, of his royal character and dignity.” See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-20.htm" title="Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!">2 Samuel 6:20</a>; Chandler’s <span class="ital">Review, </span>and Dodd. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:25-29 It is good to notice the assistance of Divine Providence, even in things which fall within the compass of our natural powers; if God did not help us, we could not stir a step.

The natural reading of the verse would seem to say that <span class="cmt_word">David and all those Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah,</span> all wore <span class="cmt_word">the robe of byssus,</span> while David had, in addition<span class="cmt_word">, the ephod of linen</span>. Yet it is unlikely that all did wear the robe. Again, the Hebrew text exhibits no preposition before the <span class="cmt_word">singers</span>, on the second occasion of the occurrence of the expression in this verse. Yet little sense can be found without a preposition. The robe was not distinctively a priest's garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-18.htm">2 Samuel 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>), though priests did wear it. The robe of byssus is spoken of only here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>. <span class="accented">Byssus</span>, however, is spoken of as material for other purposes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-21.htm">1 Chronicles 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>. The <span class="accented">ephod</span>, on the other hand, was no doubt distinctively a high priest's garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4-12</a>), though we read of Samuel wearing one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18, 28</a>), and of David doing the same, as on this occasion. The fine linen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span>), in the first clause of this verse, is not the same with that (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span>) in the last clause. The first clause of this verse (which makes the last clause somewhat redundant) bears some resemblance in letters to the <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a> <span class="bible_ref">fourteenth verse</span> of 2 Samuel 6. first clause, which means, "and David danced with all his might," and the two clauses exactly answer to one another in position - another suggestion of an uncertain text here. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These singers formed three choirs, according to the instruments they played. Heman, Asaph, and Ethan played brazen cymbals &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>); Benaiah and the seven who follow played nablia (psalteria) &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-20.htm">1 Chronicles 15:20</a>); while the last six played lutes (harps) &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-21.htm">1 Chronicles 15:21</a>). These three Hebrew words plainly denote different keys in singing, but are, owing to our small acquaintance with the music of the Hebrews, obscure, and cannot be interpreted with certainty. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;, going over from the fundamental signification glitter, shine, into the idea of outshining and superior capacity, overwhelming ability, might also, as a musical term, denote the conducting of the playing and singing as well as the leading of them. The signification to direct is here, however, excluded by the context, for the conductors were without doubt the three chief musicians or bandmasters (Capellenmeister), Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, with the cymbals, not the psaltery and lute players belonging to the second rank. The conducting must therefore be expressed by &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;, and this word must mean "in order to give a clear tone," i.e., to regulate the tune and the tone of the singing, while &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495; signifies "to take the lead in playing;" cf. Del. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>. This word, moreover, is probably not to be restricted to the singers with the lutes, the third choir, but must be held to refer also to the second choir. The meaning then will be, that Heman, Asaph, and Ethan had cymbals to direct the song, while the other singers had partly psalteries, partly lutes, in order to play the accompaniment to the singing. The song of these two choirs is moreover distinguished and defined by &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;. These words specify the kind of voices; &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; after the manner of virgins, i.e., in the soprano; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;, after the octave, i.e., in bass - al ottava bassa.
