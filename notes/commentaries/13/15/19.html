David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint &#8230; the singers with instruments&#8212;These eminent Levites were instructed to train the musicians and singers who were under them, for the solemn procession. The performers were ranged in three choirs or bands, and the names of the principal leaders are given (1Ch 15:17, 18, 21), with the instruments respectively used by each. "Ben" (1Ch 15:18) is omitted (1Ch 15:20). Either it was used merely as a common noun, to intimate that Zechariah was the son of Jaaziel or Aziel, or Ben is the same as Azaziah [1Ch 15:21].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan,....

Yet their connection in a series of four divisions of musical duty does throw some light upon them. These four verses manifestly purport to describe a special part to be performed by those of whom they respectively speak. Gesenius explains <span class="accented">psalteries on Alamoth</span> to mean such instruments as savoured of virgin tone or pitch, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> high as compared with the lower pitch of men's voices. This lower pitch he considers intimated by the word "Sheminith," literally, <span class="accented">the eighth</span>, or <span class="accented">octave</span>. The added expression, "to excel," need scarcely be, with him, understood to mean "to take the lead musically," but may be read generally to mark their supassing quality. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For because in the beginning (i.e., when the ark was removed from the house of Amminadab, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1-14</a>) it was not you (sc., who brought it up), did Jahve our God made a breach upon us," sc. by the slaying of Uzza, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-11.htm">1 Chronicles 13:11</a>.
