But the Kohathites, of whom came the priestly family of the Aaronites, had precedence in all respects. To them especially was committed the attendance upon the ark and the bearing of it. Of the six Levitical families mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5-10</a> one only was descended from Gershom, one from Merari, and four (Uriel, Elizaphan, Hebron, and Uzziel) from Kohath. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The Levites were the chiefs of their father's house (1Ch 15:12); four belonging to the Kohathite branch, on whose shoulders the ark was to be borne; namely, Uriel, Shemaiah&#8212;descended from Elizaphan or Elzaphan&#8212;(Ex 6:22), Hebron (Ex 6:18; 1Ch 6:2), and Amminadab from Uzziel (Ex 6:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites.
