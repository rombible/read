We have here an interesting reference to the fact that David was not only a minstrel and inspired psalmist, but also an inventor of stringed instruments. So the prophet Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-5.htm" title="And Abishua begat Bukki, and Bukki begat Uzzi,">1Chronicles 6:5</a>) speaks of the effeminate nobles of Israel, “who prattle on the mouth of the <span class= "ital">nebel,</span> that invent themselves instruments of music, like David.” The reference is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-36.htm" title="And his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.">Nehemiah 12:36</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Which I have made.</span>—This expression proves that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:">1Chronicles 23:4-5</a> should be within inverted commas, as representing a spoken decree of David.

Possibly the quotation of a short sentence often on David's lips. Men given to music may have been very conscious of it, in ancient days, as well as in modern. The language, however, does not necessarily assert that David claimed the inventing or in any similar sense the <span class="accented">making</span> of these musical instruments, but that he <span class="accented">appointed</span> them for the service of praise. What some of them were may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a> - "cymbals, psalteries, harps, trumpets" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35, 36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Exhortation to the princes of Israel to assist in the building of the temple. - David supports his exhortation by calling to remembrance the proofs of his favour which the Lord had showed His people. The speech in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-18.htm">1 Chronicles 22:18</a> is introduced without &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, because it is clear from the preceding &#1491;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493; that the words are spoken by David: "The Lord has given you peace round about; for He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hands, and the land is subdued before Jahve and before His people." The subdued land is Canaan: the inhabitants of the land are, however, not the Israelites over whom the Lord had set David as king, for the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; cannot apply to them, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-10.htm">1 Chronicles 14:10</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-24.htm">Joshua 2:24</a>; it is the Canaanites still left in the land in the time of David, and other enemies, who, like the Philistines, possessed parts of the land, and had been subdued by David.

This safety which the Lord had granted them binds them in duty to seek Him with all their heart, and to build the sanctuary, that the ark and the sacred vessels may be brought into it.
