Merari is the third son of Levi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a>). The <span class="cmt_word">Mahli</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Mushi</span> of this verse were possibly <span class="accented">grandson</span> and <span class="accented">son</span> of Merari, if we follow the guidance of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-47.htm">1 Chronicles 6:47</a>. Yet it would seem far more natural to explain this last-quoted passage by our ver. 23, which would then parallel it. Otherwise we must account for the name of Mahli habitually standing first, as here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-19.htm">1 Chronicles 6:19</a> also, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26</a>, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-19.htm">Exodus 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-20.htm">Numbers 3:20, 33</a>, etc.; in all of which places the statement is as distinct as in this verse, that Mahli and Mushi were sons. This and the following verse must be compared particularly with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26-29</a>; the <span class="accented">Jaaziah</span> of which passage was evidently no son of Merari, on a par with Mahli and Mushi, but a later descendant. His descendants were three - Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri (Beno being no proper name, but signifying "his son"). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Each of his two sons Gershon and Eliezer (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-22.htm">Exodus 2:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-3.htm">Exodus 18:3</a>.) founded a father's-house; Gershon through his son Shebuel (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20</a> &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1500;), Eliezer through Rehabiah. The plurals &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1490;, &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488; are used, although in both cases only one son, he who was head (&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;) of the father's-house, is mentioned, either because they had other sons, or those named had in their turn sons, who together formed a father's-house. From the remark in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-17.htm">1 Chronicles 23:17</a>, that Eliezer had no other sons than Rehabiah, while Rehabiah had very many, we may conclude that Gershon had other sons besides Shebuel, who are not mentioned because their descendants were numbered with Shebuel's father's-house.</body></html>
