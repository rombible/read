This business is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28-32</a> more nearly defined, and embraces all the business that was to be carried on about the sanctuary, except the specifically priestly functions, the keeping of the doors, and the performance of the sacred music. For these two latter offices special sections were appointed, 4000 for the porters' services, and the same number for the sacred music (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>). Besides these, 5000 men were appointed Shoterim and judges. "The instruments which I have made to sing praise" are the stringed instruments which David had introduced into the service to accompany the singing of the psalms; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-26.htm">2 Chronicles 29:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-36.htm">Nehemiah 12:36</a>. </body></html>
