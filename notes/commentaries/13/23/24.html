It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm" title="Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;">2Chronicles 31:17</a>, that the later practice, at all events, was for the Levites to enter on their sacred functions at the age of twenty. Accordingly, the older commentators have supposed that David twice numbered the Levites: first, as the Law required, from the age of thirty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-3.htm" title="Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.">1Chronicles 23:3</a>); and again, towards the close of his reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-27.htm" title="For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:">1Chronicles 23:27</a>), from the age of twenty, because he perceived that the duties had become less onerous, and might therefore be borne by younger men.

And the reason why they were now sooner admitted to service than they had been formerly, is given in the next verses, because now their work was more easy, being wholly discharged from that burdensome work of carrying the tabernacle. Besides, the people of Israel were multiplied, therefore more hands were necessary; that every Israelite who brought an offering, might find a Levite ready to assist him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:24-32 Now the people of Israel were so many, there should be more employed in the temple service, that every Israelite who brought an offering might find a Levite ready to help him. When more work is to be done, it is pity but there should be more workmen. A new heart, a spiritual mind, which delights greatly in God's commandments, and can find a refreshing feast in his ordinances, forms the great distinction between the true Christian and all other men in the world. To the spiritual man every service will yield satisfaction. He will be ever abounding in the work of the Lord; being never so happy as when employed for such a good Master, in so pleasant a service. He will not regard whether he is called to take the lead, or to keep the charge of others who are placed over him. May we seek and serve the Lord uprightly, and leave all the rest to his disposal, by faith in his word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the age of twenty years - The Levites had hitherto not entered upon their regular functions until the age of thirty <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>. Certain lighter duties were by the Law imposed on them at the age of twenty-five <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>; but it was not until they were five years older that they became liable to the full service of the sanctuary. David appears now to have made a change. By his "last words" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-27.htm">1 Chronicles 23:27</a> the time for the Levites to enter on the full duties of their office was advanced from thirty to twenty years. This change was based upon the lighter character of the labors imposed on them now that the ark had ceased to be carried from place to place and obtained a permanent habitation <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-26.htm">1 Chronicles 23:26</a>. The limit of age continued in after times where David had fixed it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 23:24-32. Office of the Levites.<p>24-27. These were the sons of Levi &#8230; that did the work &#8230; from the age of twenty years and upward&#8212;The enumeration of the Levites was made by David (1Ch 23:3) on the same rule as that followed by Moses (Nu 4:3), namely, from thirty years. But he saw afterwards that this rule might be beneficially relaxed, and that the enrolment of Levites for their proper duties might be made from twenty years of age. The ark and tabernacle being now stationary at Jerusalem, the labor of the Levites was greatly diminished, as they were no longer obliged to transport its heavy furniture from place to place. The number of thirty-eight thousand Levites, exclusive of priests, was doubtless more than sufficient for the ordinary service of the tabernacle. But this pious king thought that it would contribute to the glory of the Lord to employ as many officers in his divine service as possible. These first rules, however, which David instituted, were temporary, as very different arrangements were made after the ark had been deposited in the tabernacle of Zion.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As the Levites were anciently numbered from two several times, from the twenty-fifth year of their age, and from the thirtieth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a> 8:24</span>; in like manner and for the same reasons they are here numbered both from their twentieth year, as here, when they were more solemnly prepared for and instructed, and by degrees exercised, in some parts of their work; and from their thirtieth year, above, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-3.htm" title="Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.">1 Chronicles 23:3</a></span>, when they were admitted to the full and complete exercise of all the parts and works of their office. And the reason why they were now sooner admitted to service than they had been formerly by the constitution of Moses, is given in the next verses, because now their work was made easy, they being wholly discharged from that burdensome work of carrying the tabernacle and its utensils, which was too heavy for young and tender shoulders. To which may be added, that the number of the Israelites was greatly increased, and consequently the services which were to be performed by the Levites on their behalf were multiplied, and the work of the temple was much greater than that of the tabernacle, and therefore more of the Levites were to be employed, and consequently they were to be sooner taken into service. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These were the sons of Levi, after the house of their fathers,....

(On the present verse comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1-3, 21-23, 29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-23.htm">Numbers 8:23-26</a>.) It is not easy to reconcile this verse with ver. 3. Keil cuts the knot at once by supposing the "thirty" years of ver. 3 to be the error of a copyist, to whose memory the Mosaic census was present. And with Bertheau, he objects to the supposition that this verse describes a supplementary census, in conformity with "David's last words" (ver. 27), and as contrasted with his former directions. With the exception of what is contained in vers. 25-27, it is true that these do not offer themselves sufficient indications to make one feel confident of this explanation. On the other hand, to set down the number "thirty" in ver. 3 at once to the mistake of a copyist is too summary and convenient a way of escaping an awkward difficulty. It is evident that the following three verses do purport to explain why at this time the age of allowable service was altered to a standard so much lower than of old, and to assert that this alteration was recognized by the last orders of David. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Only one son of Jizhar, the brother of Amram, is mentioned, Shelomith as head, after whom the Jizharite father's-house is named.</body></html>
