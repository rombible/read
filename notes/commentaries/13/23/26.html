The inference is that as the duties had become so much less arduous, they might well be undertaken at an earlier age than the ancient custom permitted.<p><span class= "bld">They shall no more carry.</span>—Comp. the same infinitival construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:">2Chronicles 5:11</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:24-32 Now the people of Israel were so many, there should be more employed in the temple service, that every Israelite who brought an offering might find a Levite ready to help him. When more work is to be done, it is pity but there should be more workmen. A new heart, a spiritual mind, which delights greatly in God's commandments, and can find a refreshing feast in his ordinances, forms the great distinction between the true Christian and all other men in the world. To the spiritual man every service will yield satisfaction. He will be ever abounding in the work of the Lord; being never so happy as when employed for such a good Master, in so pleasant a service. He will not regard whether he is called to take the lead, or to keep the charge of others who are placed over him. May we seek and serve the Lord uprightly, and leave all the rest to his disposal, by faith in his word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the age of twenty years - The Levites had hitherto not entered upon their regular functions until the age of thirty <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>. Certain lighter duties were by the Law imposed on them at the age of twenty-five <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>; but it was not until they were five years older that they became liable to the full service of the sanctuary. David appears now to have made a change. By his "last words" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-27.htm">1 Chronicles 23:27</a> the time for the Levites to enter on the full duties of their office was advanced from thirty to twenty years. This change was based upon the lighter character of the labors imposed on them now that the ark had ceased to be carried from place to place and obtained a permanent habitation <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-26.htm">1 Chronicles 23:26</a>. The limit of age continued in after times where David had fixed it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 23:24-32. Office of the Levites.<p>24-27. These were the sons of Levi &#8230; that did the work &#8230; from the age of twenty years and upward&#8212;The enumeration of the Levites was made by David (1Ch 23:3) on the same rule as that followed by Moses (Nu 4:3), namely, from thirty years. But he saw afterwards that this rule might be beneficially relaxed, and that the enrolment of Levites for their proper duties might be made from twenty years of age. The ark and tabernacle being now stationary at Jerusalem, the labor of the Levites was greatly diminished, as they were no longer obliged to transport its heavy furniture from place to place. The number of thirty-eight thousand Levites, exclusive of priests, was doubtless more than sufficient for the ordinary service of the tabernacle. But this pious king thought that it would contribute to the glory of the Lord to employ as many officers in his divine service as possible. These first rules, however, which David instituted, were temporary, as very different arrangements were made after the ark had been deposited in the tabernacle of Zion.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Also unto the Levites; </span> or rather, <span class="ital">as concerning the Levites</span>, of whom he is here speaking. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And also unto the Levites,....

Emphasis is laid on the thought of the relief that permanent habitation in Jerusalem conferred on the Levites over and above the whole body of the rest of the people.
