From Amram came Aaron and Moses; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>. Of these, Aaron with his sons was set apart "to sanctify him to be a most holy one; he and his sons for ever to offer incense before Jahve, to serve Him, and to bless in His name for ever." &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1511; &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; signifies neither, ut ministraret in sancto sanctorum (Vulg., Syr.), nor, ut res sanctissimas, sacrificia, vasa sacra etc. consecrarent (Cler.). Against this interpretation we adduce not only the objection advanced by Hgstb. Christol. iii. p. 119, trans., that the office assigned by it to the Levites is far too subordinate to be mentioned here in the first place, but also the circumstance that the suffix in &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, after the analogy of &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;, must denote the object of the sanctifying; and this view is confirmed by the subject, who offers incense and blesses, not being expressed with &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;. The Vulgate translation cannot be accepted, for &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; cannot be the ablative, and the most holy place in the temple is always called &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; with the article. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, without the article, is only used of the most holy things, e.g., of the vessels connected with the worship, the sacrificial gifts, and other things which no lay person might touch or appropriate. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>. Here it is committed to Aaron, who, by being chosen for the priest's service and anointed to the office, was made a most holy person, to discharge along with his sons all the priestly functions in the sanctuary. Specimens of such functions are then adduced: &#1497;&#1497; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;, the offering of the sacrifice of incense upon the altar of the inner sanctuary, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-5.htm">2 Chronicles 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7</a>.; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;, "to serve Him," Jahve, - a general expression, including all the other services in the sanctuary, which were reserved for the priests; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1500;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;, to bless in His name, i.e., to pronounce the blessing in the name of the Lord over the people, according to the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; not "to bless His name" (Ges., Berth.). To call upon or praise the name of God is &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-2.htm">Psalm 96:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>; and the assertion that &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is a somewhat later phrase formed on the model of &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, for "to call upon God" (Ges. in Lex. sub voce &#1489;&#1500;&#1498;), is quite groundless. Our phrase occurs as early as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; and the latter passage in connection with &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; of the priests; in the former, of the tribe of Levi, but so used that it can refer only to the priests, not to the Levites also.</body></html>
