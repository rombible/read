The formula of the original history, from which both Samuel and Chronicles have derived a chief part of their substance, has been taken over without modification, after the manner of Oriental compilers. We may, therefore, regard the phrase as a mere mark of transition in the narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Gath and her towns.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">her daughters,</span> that is, outlying dependencies.

Its literal signification is "the bridle or curb of the mother city," and may mark a special strong position which commanded Gath, or it may describe Gath as owning itself to such a position. Gesenius understands it to mean that David "subjected the metropolis of the Philistines to himself," quoting the Arabian proverb, To <span class="accented">give</span> one s bridle to any one, as equivalent to submitting to him. He quotes also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>. It may be noted that Ammah is spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-24.htm">2 Samuel 2:24</a>) as the name of a hill, otherwise unknown, however. Although David subdued so many places, he reigned over them, <span class="accented">i.e</span>, over many of them, still by "their own kings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>).

This explanation, however, does not justify us in supposing that &#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; has been dropped out of the Chronicle. The words &#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; are either to be subordinated in a loose connection to the clause, to define the way in which God has made Himself a name (cf. Ew. 283), or connected with &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; in a pregnant sense: "to make Thee a name, (doing) great and fearful things." But, on the other hand, the converse expression in Samuel, "fearful things for Thy land, before Thy people which Thou redeemedst to Thee from Egypt (from) the nations and their gods," is explained in Chronicles by the interpolation of &#1500;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;: "fearful things, to drive out before Thy people, which ... nations." The divergences cannot be explained by the hypothesis that both texts are mutilated, as is sufficiently shown by the contradictions into which Thenius and Bertheau have fallen in their attempts so to explain them.<p>All the remaining divergences of one text from the other are only variations of the expression, such as involuntarily arise in the endeavour to give a clear and intelligible narrative, without making a literal copy of the authority made use of. Among these we include even &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, "Thy servant hath found to pray" (1 Chr. , as compared with &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, "Thy servant hath found his heart," i.e., found courage, to pray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-28.htm">2 Samuel 7:28</a>); where it is impossible to decide whether the author of the books of Samuel has added &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; as an explanation, or the author of the Chronicle has omitted it because the phrase "to find his heart" occurs only in this single passage of the Old Testament. &#1500;&#1492;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; signifies, Thy servant has reached the point of directing this prayer to Thee. </body></html>
