David Smites Hadadezer and the Syrians.<p>3. Hadarezer&#8212;or, "Hadadezer" (2Sa 8:3), which was probably the original form of the name, was derived from Hadad, a Syrian deity. It seems to have become the official and hereditary title of the rulers of that kingdom.<p>Zobah&#8212;Its situation is determined by the words "unto" or "towards Hamath," a little to the northeast of Damascus, and is supposed by some to be the same place as in earlier times was called Hobah (Ge 14:15). Previous to the rise of Damascus, Zobah was the capital of the kingdom which held supremacy among the petty states of Syria.<p>as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates&#8212;Some refer this to David, who was seeking to extend his possessions in one direction towards a point bordering on the Euphrates, in accordance with the promise (Ge 15:18; Nu 24:17).

This explanation, however, does not justify us in supposing that &#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; has been dropped out of the Chronicle. The words &#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; are either to be subordinated in a loose connection to the clause, to define the way in which God has made Himself a name (cf. Ew. 283), or connected with &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; in a pregnant sense: "to make Thee a name, (doing) great and fearful things." But, on the other hand, the converse expression in Samuel, "fearful things for Thy land, before Thy people which Thou redeemedst to Thee from Egypt (from) the nations and their gods," is explained in Chronicles by the interpolation of &#1500;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;: "fearful things, to drive out before Thy people, which ... nations." The divergences cannot be explained by the hypothesis that both texts are mutilated, as is sufficiently shown by the contradictions into which Thenius and Bertheau have fallen in their attempts so to explain them.<p>All the remaining divergences of one text from the other are only variations of the expression, such as involuntarily arise in the endeavour to give a clear and intelligible narrative, without making a literal copy of the authority made use of. Among these we include even &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, "Thy servant hath found to pray" (1 Chr. , as compared with &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, "Thy servant hath found his heart," i.e., found courage, to pray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-28.htm">2 Samuel 7:28</a>); where it is impossible to decide whether the author of the books of Samuel has added &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; as an explanation, or the author of the Chronicle has omitted it because the phrase "to find his heart" occurs only in this single passage of the Old Testament. &#1500;&#1492;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; signifies, Thy servant has reached the point of directing this prayer to Thee. </body></html>
