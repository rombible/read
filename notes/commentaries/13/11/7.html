But Abner, the captain of Saul's host, led Ishbosheth, Saul's son, with the remainder of the defeated army of the Israelites, to Mahanaim in Gilead, and there made him king over Gilead, and gradually also, as he reconquered it from the Philistines, over the land of Israel, over Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all (the remainder of) Israel, with the exception of the tribal domain of Judah. Ishbosheth's kingship did not last longer than two years, while David reigned over Judah in Hebron for seven years and a half (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>). When Abner advanced with Ishbosheth's army from Mahanaim against Gibeon, he was defeated by Joab, David's captain, so that he was obliged again to withdraw beyond Jordan (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-32</a>); and although the struggle between the house of Saul and the house of David still continued, yet the house of Saul waxed ever weaker, while David's power increased. At length, when Ishbosheth reproached the powerful Abner because of a concubine of his father's, he threatened that he would transfer the crown of Israel to David, and carried his threat into execution without delay. He imparted his design to the elders of Israel and Benjamin; and when they had given their consent, he made his way to Hebron, and announced to David the submission of all Israel to his sway (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1-21</a>). Abner, indeed, did not fully carry out the undertaking; for on his return journey he was assassinated by Joab, without David's knowledge, and against his will. Immediately afterwards, Ishbosheth, who had become powerless and spiritless through terror at Abner's death, was murdered in his own house by two of the leaders of his army. There now remained of Saul's family only Jonathan's son Mephibosheth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-1.htm">2 Samuel 4:1-12</a>), then not more than twelve years old, and lame in both his feet, and all the tribes of Israel determined to anoint David to be their king. The carrying out of this resolution is narrated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-1.htm">1 Chronicles 11:1-3</a>, in complete agreement as to the facts with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>, where the matter has been already commented upon. In ch. 12 23-40 there follows a more detailed account of the assembly of the tribes of Israel in Hebron. The last words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-3.htm">1 Chronicles 11:3</a>, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, are a didactic addition of the author of the Chronicle, which has been derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4-5</a>, in accordance with the custom of the author of the books of Samuel and Kings to state the age and duration of the reign of each of the kings immediately after the announcement of their entry upon their office, there follows after the preceding a statement of the duration of David's reign; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>, etc. This remark is to be found in the Chronicle only at the close of David's reign; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>, which shows that Thenius' opinion that this verse has been omitted from the Chronicle by a mistake is not tenable. </body></html>
