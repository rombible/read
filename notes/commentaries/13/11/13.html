The text may be restored thus: “He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines had gathered to the battle; and the men of Israel went up (perhaps, up the mountain side, in retreat). And he stood his ground, and smote the Philistines until his hand was benumbed, and clave to the sword. And Iahweh wrought a great victory on that day. And the people began returning (from flight) behind him only to spoil (the slain). And after him (was) Shammah ben Agê, an Hararite. And the Philistines gathered together unto Lehi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-9.htm" title="Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.">Judges 15:9</a>).

The cause of this serious omission was perhaps the double occurrence of the phrase “the Philistines gathered together.” The eye of some copyist wandered from one to the other. What was originally told of Eleazar the second hero, was that his prowess turned the flight at Pas-dammim into a victory.<p><span class= "bld">Where was a parcel of ground full of barley.</span>—The scene of the exploit of the third hero, Shammah, son of Agê.

He was with David at Pas-dammim&#8212;It was at the time when he was a fugitive in the wilderness, and, parched with thirst under the burning heat of noonday, he wistfully thought of the cool fountain of his native village [2Sa 23:15; 1Ch 11:17]. This is a notice of the achievement, to which Eleazar owed his fame, but the details are found only in 2Sa 23:9-11, where it is further said that he was aided by the valor of Shammah, a fact corroborated in the passage before us (1Ch 11:14), where it is recorded of the heroes, that "they set themselves in the midst of that parcel." As the singular number is used in speaking of Shammah (2Sa 23:12), the true view seems to be that when Eleazar had given up from exhaustion, Shammah succeeded, and by his fresh and extraordinary prowess preserved the field.<p>barley&#8212;or lentils (2Sa 23:11). Ephes-dammim was situated between Shocoh and Azekah, in the west of the Judahite territory.

It was near Shocoh, or Soech, in Judah, some fourteen miles south-west of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Full of barley</span>. The Authorized Version reading in the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a>) is "full of lentiles," the Hebrew for "barley" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, for "lentiles" <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Possibly the words should be the same, one being here spelt, by accident, wrongly for the other (so Kennicott). The first Bible mention of "barley" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 32</a>, from which verses we learn that it, together with "flax," was an earlier crop than "rye" and "wheat." It was not only used for food for man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>), but also for horses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-28.htm">1 Kings 4:28</a>). That it was nevertheless of the less-valued grain, we have significant indications, in its being prescribed for the "jealousy offering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>, comp. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), and in its being part of the purchase price of the adulteress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>). Its derivation in the Hebrew, from a verbal root signifying "to bristle," is in noticeable analogy with the Latin <span class="accented">hordeum</span>, from <span class="accented">horreo.</span> Gesenius's observation, that the singular of the word given above in the Hebrew marks the "growing crop," and the plural the "grain" itself, seems hardly corroborated by this single passage at all events. The <span class="accented">lentile</span>, on the other hand, was a species of <span class="accented">bean</span>, and used much for soup, of which Egyptian tomb-paintings furnish illustration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9</a>). Sonnini, in his 'Travels' (translation of Hunter, 3:288), tells us that still the Egyptian poor eat <span class="accented">lentile-bread</span>, but, what is more <span class="accented">apropos</span> of this passage, that in making it they prefer to mix a little "barley" with it. This apparent discrepancy between the parallel accounts not only counts in itself for very little, but may easily be surmounted by supposing that, though it be written that the "parcel" of ground was "full of lentiles," and again "full of barley," the description may only amount to this, that such parcels were in close juxtaposition. But if not, our allusion above to the possible error in the Hebrew words will sufficiently explain the variation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The capture of the citadel of Zion, and Jerusalem chosen to be the royal residence under the name of the city of David; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-10</a>, and the commentary on this section at that place. - &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>, to make alive, is used here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Nehemiah 4:2</a>, of the rebuilding of ruins.
