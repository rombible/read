Syriac reads “and he was commanding thirty men,” which gives the apparent meaning of the verse. If, as seems likely, the “thirty” were the officers of David’s guard of six hundred warriors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-13.htm" title="Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go.

Yet David reckoned his success, not as from the mighty men that were with him, but from the mighty God, whose presence is all in all. In strengthening him, they strengthened themselves and their own interest, for his advancement was theirs. We shall gain by what we do in our places for the support of the kingdom of the Son of David; and those that are faithful to Him, shall find their names registered much more to their honour, than these are in the records of fame.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sons of Hashem - It is impossible that this can be the true reading, since an individual warrior must be spoken of. Comparing <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-32.htm">2 Samuel 23:32</a>, perhaps the most probable conjecture is that the "Beni-Hashem" of Chronicles and the "Beni Jashen" of Samuel alike conceal some single name of a man which cannot now be recovered. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. Uriah the Hittite&#8212;The enrolment of this name in such a list, attesting, as it does, his distinguished merits as a brave and devoted officer, aggravates the criminality of David's outrage on his life and honor. The number of the names at 1Ch 11:26-41 (exclusive of Asahel and Uriah, who were dead) is thirty, and at 1Ch 11:41-47 is sixteen&#8212;making together forty-eight (see on [368]1Ch 27:1-34). Of those mentioned (1Ch 11:26-41), the greater part belonged to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin; the sixteen names (1Ch 11:41-47) are all associated with places unknown, or with cities and districts on the east of the Jordan. The northern tribes do not appear to have furnished any leaders [Bertheau].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thirty captains, who were under him at their colonel <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And inquired not of the Lord,....

It was apparently meant to stand after the name of Uriah the Hittite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm" title="Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,">1 Chronicles 11:41</a>) by some scribe who followed our present text and referred “the sons of Hashem” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-34.htm" title="The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,">1 Chronicles 11:34</a>) to Azmaveth and Eliahba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-33.htm" title="Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,">1 Chronicles 11:33</a>), thus reckoning just thirty names from Asahel to Uriah. The clause should be read <span class="ital">either</span> “and up to him are thirty” <span class="ital">or</span> “and all of them are thirty” (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-39.htm" title="Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.">2 Samuel 23:39</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty with him</span>. The Hebrew preposition here translated "with" appears thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, and will naturally translate "and in addition to him." As he was a captain, this addendum may probably refer to those over whom he was captain, and whom he brought in his train, and who were possibly themselves officers. As the writer of Chronicles indicates no difference, nor any sense of a change of persons enumerated, when he has reached (ver. 41) Uriah the Hittite, it would all the rather be consistent with his own superscription when (ver. 26) he proposes to set forth simply "the valiant men of the armies" without confining their number to the "thirty." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-21.htm">1 Chronicles 11:21</a> should be translated: honoured before the three as two; i.e., doubly honoured-he became to them prince, leader. With regard to &#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which, as meaningless, Bertheau would alter so as to make it correspond with &#1492;&#1499;&#1497; (Sam.), cf. Ew. Lehrb. 269, b. For Benaiah and his exploits, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22-25</a>, see the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20-23</a>.<p>No special deeds of the heroes enumerated in vv. 26-47 are related, so that we may regard them as a third class, who are not equal to the first triad, and to the second pair, Abishai and Benaiah, and consequently occupied a subordinate place in the collective body of the royal body-guards. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a> thirty-two names are mentioned, which, with the above-mentioned three and two of the first and second classes, amount in all to thirty-seven men, as is expressly remarked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a> at the conclusion. In the text of the Chronicle no number is mentioned, and the register is increased by sixteen names (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41-47</a>), which have been added in the course of time to the earlier number. The words &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-26.htm">1 Chronicles 11:26</a>, are to be regarded as a superscription: And valiant heroes were, etc.; equivalent to, But besides there, there remain still the following valiant heroes. The words &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; are not synonymous with &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, leaders of the host, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>, (Berth.), but signify heroes in warlike strength, i.e., heroic warriors, like &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;   (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-5.htm">1 Chronicles 7:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-7.htm">1 Chronicles 7:7</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-11.htm">1 Chronicles 7:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-40.htm">1 Chronicles 7:40</a>). That &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; has here the article, while it is not found in the passages quoted from the seventh chapter, does not make any difference in the meaning of the words. The article is used, here, as with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, because the heroes of David are spoken of, and &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is to be mentally supplied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>. As to the names in vv. 26-41, which are also found in the register in the book of Samuel, see the commentary to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24-39</a>. This list, which is common to both books, begins with Asahel, a brother of Joab, who was slain by Abner in the war which he waged against David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-19.htm">2 Samuel 2:19-23</a>), and concludes in the book of Samuel with Uriah the Hittite, so well known from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-3.htm">2 Samuel 11:3</a>. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41</a>), with whose wife David committed adultery. But to the continuation of the register which is found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41-47</a> of our text, there is no parallel in the other writings of the Old Testament by which we might form an idea as to the correctness of the names. The individual names are indeed to be met with, for the most part, in other parts of the Old Testament, but denote other men of an earlier or later time. The names &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-45.htm">1 Chronicles 11:45</a>, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-46.htm">1 Chronicles 11:46</a>., are found also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-20.htm">1 Chronicles 12:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-11.htm">1 Chronicles 12:11</a>, among those of the valiant men who before Saul's death went over to David, but we cannot with any certainty ascertain whether the persons meant were the same. The expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-42.htm">1 Chronicles 11:42</a>) is also obscure, - "and to him in addition," i.e., together with him, thirty, - since the thought that with Adina the chief of the Reubenites, or besides him, there were thirty (men), has no meaning in this register. The lxx and the Vulgate read &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, while the Syriac, on the contrary, makes use of the periphrasis, "And even he was a ruler over thirty heroes;" and Bertheau accordingly recommends the emendation &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;, and thence concludes that the tribe of Reuben had thirty leaders in its army-a conjecture as bold as it is improbable. Were &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; to be read, we could not but refer the words to the thirty heroes of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, and hold Adina to be their leader, which could not be easily reconciled with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>.
