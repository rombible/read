Therefore they say, Blind and lame must not enter the house” (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Temple). Such is the simplest rendering of an obscure, but evidently original record.

It is not said in Samuel that Joab first became commander-in-chief on this occasion; on the contrary he appears in command (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.">2 Samuel 2:13</a>) during the civil war against the house of Saul.

It is true that Joab already held high office, probably the first place as captain of David's men, but Bertheau's objection to the statements of this verse on such grounds easily yields to the considerations - first, that there can be no doubt Joab had fallen into disfavour with David <span class="accented">and others</span>, upon his slaying of Abner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26-29, 36, 37</a>); and further, that this was a great occasion, exceedingly favourable for evoking any very special ability of younger or unknown men, at present lost under the shadow of larger growths. The advantage which Joab gained now was one that confirmed his position and increased largely his influence; and an indication that he was not slow to avail himself of it is probably to be traced in the eighth verse, where it is said while "David built...  even from Millo round about,...  Joab repaired the rest of the city." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And because he inquired not of the Lord, therefore He slew him.
