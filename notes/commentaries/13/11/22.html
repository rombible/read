The phrase however is very difficult to interpret. Another translation is “he slew the two champions of Moab.” A fourth (perhaps the best) is “he smote the two altar-pillars of Moab,” i.e. he overthrew the two high columns on which the sacred fire of the Moabites was kept (Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">Religion of the Semites</span>, Additional Note L).

He was "captain of the host for the third month...  and in his course were twenty and four thousand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>). When in our ver. 25 it is said that "David set him over his guard," the allusion probably is to his uniform and prolonged command of "the Cherethites and Pelethites" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>).

That three others, different from the before-mentioned Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah are intended, is plain from the omission of the article with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;; for if these three were spoken of, we would have &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-18.htm">1 Chronicles 11:18</a>. For further remarks on this exploit, which was probably performed in the war treated of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-8.htm">1 Chronicles 14:8</a>., and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17</a>., see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13-17</a>. The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1491;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-19.htm">1 Chronicles 11:19</a>, are to be translated, "The blood of these men shall I drink in their souls? for for their souls (i.e., for the price of their souls, at the risk of their life) have they brought it." The expression "blood in their souls" is to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a> (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;, "his blood is in the soul," is that which constitutes his soul). As there blood and soul are used synonymously (the blood as seat of and container of the soul, and the soul as floating in the blood), so here David, according to our account of his words, compares the water, which those heroes had brought for the price of their souls, to the souls of the men, and the drinking of the water to the drinking of their souls, and finally the souls to the blood, in order to express his abhorrence of such a draught. The meaning therefore may be thus expressed: "Shall I drink in this water the souls, and so the blood, of these men; for they have brought the water even for the price of their souls?"  </body></html>
