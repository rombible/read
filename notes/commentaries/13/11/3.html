David Made King.<p>1. Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron&#8212;This event happened on the death of Ish-bosheth (see on [362]2Sa 5:1). The convention of the estates of the kingdom, the public and solemn homage of the representatives of the people, and the repeated anointing of the new king in their presence and by their direction, seem to have been necessary to the general acknowledgment of the sovereign on the part of the nation (compare 1Sa 11:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And inquired not of the Lord,....

A forcible use of this phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>. It implies that the engagement was ratified in the presence of a holy place, a holy vessel of the sanctuary, or a holy person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>).

The first time of David's being anointed (l <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 13</a>) Samuel the prophet officiated. The second time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>) was when the "men of Judah" anointed him king over "the house of Judah." This third time when David was anointed king over the united people, it was at all events at the special instance of "all the elders of Israel," although who officiated on these two last occasions is not mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord by Samuel</span>. The sentence marks the complete fulfilment of what had been foreshadowed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12, 13</a>; and it may probably have been the more carefully introduced by the compiler of Chronicles, in consideration of the absence from his own work of previous details and of the previous anointings of David. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the following day the Philistines, in their search among the fallen, found and plundered the bodies of Saul and of his sons, and sent the head and the armour of Saul round about the land of the Philistines, to proclaim the news of their victory to their people and their gods.
