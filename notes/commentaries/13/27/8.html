The month Nisan, sometimes called Abib, which was March: <p>was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel; the first and chief of David's worthies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>. <p>and in his course were twenty and four; and so in all the following ones; this man was of the posterity of Perez, or Pharez, a son of Judah, and so had the preference and command of all the captains of the army for that month: <p>Dodai an Ahohite; the same with Dodo, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-12.htm">1 Chronicles 11:12</a> was over the course of the second month, the month Ziv, sometimes called Jiar, or April; and his lieutenant or successor was Mikloth: <p>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest; or rather a prince, a principal officer, was general of the army for the third month, Sivan, or May; the same was mighty among the thirty, and even above them, for he was among the three mighty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a> and Ammizabad his son succeeded him, or was his deputy, when other ways employed: though led by our version here, and following the Jewish writers, I have called Benaiah a priest; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-31.htm">1 Kings 2:31</a>, yet I am now rather of opinion that he was not one; for though priests might bear arms on some occasions, yet it is not likely that one should be in a constant military office, and especially general of an army; and besides, this man was of Kabzeel, a city in the tribe of Judah, which is not mentioned among the Levitical cities, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>. Asahel the brother of Joab was over the course for the fourth month, Tammuz, or June, and who being slain by Abner, his son Zebadiah succeeded him: Shamhuth, the same with Shammah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a> and Shammoth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-27.htm">1 Chronicles 11:27</a> was captain for the fifth month, Ab, or July: Ira the son of Ikkesh, the Tekoite, was over the course of the sixth month, Elul, or August, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-28.htm">1 Chronicles 11:28</a>. Helez the Pelonite was captain for the seventh month, Tisri, or September, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-27.htm">1 Chronicles 11:27</a>, the captain for the eighth month, Marchesvan, sometimes called Bul, or October, was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zarbites, of the posterity of Zerah, a son of Judah in the line of Hushah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>, the captain of the course for the ninth month, Cisleu, or November was Abiezer, of Anethoth, in the tribe of Benjamin, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-28.htm">1 Chronicles 11:28</a>, Maharai, of Netophah, in the tribe of Judah, and of the posterity of Zerah, was over the course for the tenth month, Tebet, or December, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-30.htm">1 Chronicles 11:30</a> and the captain for the eleventh month, Sheber, or January, was Benaiah, of Pirathon, in the tribe of Ephraim, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-31.htm">1 Chronicles 11:31</a> and over the course for the twelfth month, Adar, or February, was Heldai the Netophathite, the same with Heled, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-30.htm">1 Chronicles 11:30</a> and who was of the posterity of Othniel, the first judge in Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">Shamhuth the Izrahite</span>] Perhaps to be identified with “Shammoth the Harorite” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-27.htm" title="Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,">1 Chronicles 11:27</a>; see note there.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shamhuth</span>.
