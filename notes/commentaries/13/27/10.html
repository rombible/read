So long as we stand armed with the whole armour of God, in the exercise of faith, and preparation of heart for the conflict, we shall certainly be safe, and probably enjoy inward peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Asahel died before the courses, as here described, could have been instituted.

The words &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; are obscure. At the end of the sixth verse similar words occur, and hence Bertheau concludes that &#1493;&#1468; before &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is to be struck out, and translated, "and his divisions, Mikloth the prince," which might denote, perhaps, "and his division is that over which Mikloth was prince." Older commentators have already translated the word in a similar manner, as signifying that Mikloth was prince or chief of this division under the Ahohite Eleazar. All that is certain is, that &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is a name which occurred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-32.htm">1 Chronicles 8:32</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-37.htm">1 Chronicles 9:37</a> among the Benjamites.</body></html>
