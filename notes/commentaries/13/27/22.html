Much of the wisdom of princes is seen in the choice of their ministry, and common persons show it in the choice of their advisers. David, though he had all these about him, preferred the word of God before them all.

We can only suppose that the lists, as they came down to the writer of Chronicles, were incomplete.

In the catalogue the tribes Gad and Asher are omitted for reasons unknown to us, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4.htm">1 Chronicles 4-7</a>, in the genealogies of the tribes, Dan and Zebulun are.
