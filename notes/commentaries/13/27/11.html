So long as we stand armed with the whole armour of God, in the exercise of faith, and preparation of heart for the conflict, we shall certainly be safe, and probably enjoy inward peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Asahel died before the courses, as here described, could have been instituted.

The month Nisan, sometimes called Abib, which was March: <p>was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel; the first and chief of David's worthies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>. <p>and in his course were twenty and four; and so in all the following ones; this man was of the posterity of Perez, or Pharez, a son of Judah, and so had the preference and command of all the captains of the army for that month: <p>Dodai an Ahohite; the same with Dodo, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-12.htm">1 Chronicles 11:12</a> was over the course of the second month, the month Ziv, sometimes called Jiar, or April; and his lieutenant or successor was Mikloth: <p>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest; or rather a prince, a principal officer, was general of the army for the third month, Sivan, or May; the same was mighty among the thirty, and even above them, for he was among the three mighty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a> and Ammizabad his son succeeded him, or was his deputy, when other ways employed: though led by our version here, and following the Jewish writers, I have called Benaiah a priest; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-31.htm">1 Kings 2:31</a>, yet I am now rather of opinion that he was not one; for though priests might bear arms on some occasions, yet it is not likely that one should be in a constant military office, and especially general of an army; and besides, this man was of Kabzeel, a city in the tribe of Judah, which is not mentioned among the Levitical cities, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>.
