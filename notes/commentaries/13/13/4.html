Let us bring the ark to us, that it may be a blessing to us. Those who honour God, profit themselves. It is the wisdom of those setting out in the world, to take God's ark with them.

The original terms, "Let us send," imply immediate execution; and, doubtless, the publication of the royal edict would have been followed by the appointment of an early day for the contemplated solemnity, had it not been retarded by a sudden invasion of the Philistines, who were twice repulsed with great loss (2Sa 5:17), by the capture of Jerusalem, and the transference of the seat of government to that city.

The infinitive &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;&#1512; is substantially a continuation of the preceding participles, but grammatically is dependent on &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; understood (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>). Cf. as to this free use of the infinitive with &#1500;, Ew. 351, c. The signification of the verb &#1506;&#1491;&#1512;, which occurs only here (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-33.htm">1 Chronicles 12:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>), is doubtful. According to the lxx and the Vulg. (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, venerunt in auxilium), and nine MSS, which read &#1500;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;, we would be inclined to take &#1506;&#1491;&#1512; for the Aramaic form of the Hebrew &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; (cf. Arabic &#8219;dr), to help; but that meaning does not suit &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>. Its connection there demands that &#1506;&#1491;&#1512; should signify "to close up together," to set in order the battle array; and so here, closing up together with not double heart, i.e., with whole or stedfast heart (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>), animo integro et firmo atque concordi; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a> (Mich.). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a> we have a comprehensive statement; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which refers to all the bodies of men enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-24.htm">1 Chronicles 12:24-37</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; defectively written; and as it occurs only here, it may be perhaps a mere orthographical error. The whole of the remainder of Israel who did not go to Hebron were &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; er, of one, i.e., of united heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-12.htm">2 Chronicles 30:12</a>): they had a unanimous wish to make David king.</body></html>
