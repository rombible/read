The preposition &#1500; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; groups together the individual chiefs of the people just named. He laid his purpose before "all the congregation of Israel," i.e., before the above-mentioned princes as representatives of the whole people. "If it seem good to you, and if it come from Jahve our God," i.e., if the matter be willed of and approved by God, we will send as speedily as possible. The words &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; without the conjunction are so connected that &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492; defines the idea expressed by &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, "we will break through, will send," for "we will, breaking through," i.e., acting quickly and energetically, "send thither." The construction of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1506;&#1500; is accounted for by the fact that the sending thither includes the notion of commanding (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, all the provinces of the various tribal domains, is used for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>, here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>; in all which places the idea of the division of the land into a number of territories is prominent. This usage is founded upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>, where the plural points to the number of small tribes which possessed Canaan.
