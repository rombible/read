For Chidon, the parallel place has <span class="accented">Nachon</span>; possibly these are two names of the same place, or one form is a corruption of the ether; but there is nothing to determine for us which. Owing to the meaning of Nachon being "prepared," the version of Aquila is "to the prepared threshingfloor," with which the Jonathan Targum agrees, and (for this Chronicles passage) the Joseph Targum gives <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>. The <span class="accented">threshing-</span>floor was a circular plot of hard ground, from fifty to one hundred feet in diameter, on which the oxen trampled out the grain. Threshingfloors evidently often became landmarks, and helped to designate places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The oxen stumbled</span>. In the parallel place the Authorized Version renders "shook it." The Hebrew verb is the same (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>) in both places. Its elementary meanings are "to strike" and "to throw down." Perhaps the meaning is near the Vulgate rendering, c<span class="accented">alcitrabant</span>, and equivalent to the rendering, <span class="accented">became restive.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The introduction to this event is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a> very brief; but according to our narrative, David consulted with the chief men over thousands and hundreds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">1 Chronicles 15:25</a>), viz., with all the princes. The preposition &#1500; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; groups together the individual chiefs of the people just named. He laid his purpose before "all the congregation of Israel," i.e., before the above-mentioned princes as representatives of the whole people. "If it seem good to you, and if it come from Jahve our God," i.e., if the matter be willed of and approved by God, we will send as speedily as possible. The words &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; without the conjunction are so connected that &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492; defines the idea expressed by &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, "we will break through, will send," for "we will, breaking through," i.e., acting quickly and energetically, "send thither." The construction of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1506;&#1500; is accounted for by the fact that the sending thither includes the notion of commanding (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, all the provinces of the various tribal domains, is used for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>, here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>; in all which places the idea of the division of the land into a number of territories is prominent. This usage is founded upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>, where the plural points to the number of small tribes which possessed Canaan.
