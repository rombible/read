So also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-2.htm" title="And said to them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as you be entered into it, you shall find a colt tied, where on never man sat; loose him, and bring him.">Mark 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-7.htm" title="And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat on him.">Mark 11:7</a>) our Lord rode into Jerusalem on a colt “whereon no man ever yet sat.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the house of Abinadab</span>] Here the ark had been for at least twenty years under the charge of a man sanctified to keep it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD....">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They carried</span>; the Authorized Version of the parallel "they set" But the verb is the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, a word carrying more of majesty in its use (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>; 68:38; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A new cart</span>. The stress laid on the newness of this cart, the term being twice repeated in the parallel passage, may justly remind of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-2.htm">Mark 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a> (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The house of Abinadab</span>. There is no mention of Abinadab that would indicate that he still lived, even when twenty years before, the ark was placed in his house. Eleazar was his eldest son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>), and was "sanctified to keep the ark of the Lord." <span class="cmt_word">Uzza</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Ahio</span> were possibly sons of Eleazar, and not sons of Abinadab, and Eleazar's younger brothers. The Septuagint translates <span class="accented">Ahio</span>, and accordingly reads, "Uzza and his brethren drave the cart." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The introduction to this event is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a> very brief; but according to our narrative, David consulted with the chief men over thousands and hundreds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">1 Chronicles 15:25</a>), viz., with all the princes. The preposition &#1500; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; groups together the individual chiefs of the people just named. He laid his purpose before "all the congregation of Israel," i.e., before the above-mentioned princes as representatives of the whole people. "If it seem good to you, and if it come from Jahve our God," i.e., if the matter be willed of and approved by God, we will send as speedily as possible. The words &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; without the conjunction are so connected that &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492; defines the idea expressed by &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, "we will break through, will send," for "we will, breaking through," i.e., acting quickly and energetically, "send thither." The construction of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1506;&#1500; is accounted for by the fact that the sending thither includes the notion of commanding (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, all the provinces of the various tribal domains, is used for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>, here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>; in all which places the idea of the division of the land into a number of territories is prominent. This usage is founded upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>, where the plural points to the number of small tribes which possessed Canaan.
