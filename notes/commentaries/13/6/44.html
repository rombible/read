Ethan is no doubt the same as Jeduthun, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm" title="Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:">1Chronicles 25:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm" title="And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.">2Chronicles 35:15</a>.<p>(44) <span class= "bld">And their brethren the sons of Merari.</span>—We should say their <span class= "ital">comrades</span> or <span class= "ital">kinsmen</span> (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-39.htm" title="And his brother Asaph, who stood on his right hand, even Asaph the son of Berachiah, the son of Shimea,">1Chronicles 6:39</a>). “Brethren,” or “brothers,” is the natural style for the members of a guild, whether religious like the monastic bodies, or commercial like the city companies of London, or benevolent like the Freemasons. The plural pronoun refers to the two preceding guilds of Heman and Asaph. The Ethanites stood on the left of the Hemanites in the sanctuary, as the Asaphites stood on their right, and this arrangement was hereditary.<p>Kishi is a contraction of Kushaiah, like Zabdi of Zebadiah.<p>(47) <span class= "bld">Son of Manli, the son of Mushi.</span>—In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-19.htm" title="The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. And these are the families of the Levites according to their fathers.">1Chronicles 6:19</a> Mahli and Mushi appear as two sons of Merari; so also at Lev. 3:20. Mahli son of Mushi here must be nephew of the Mahli of those two passages, if the genealogical form is in each case to be understood literally. It is difficult on a first inspection to perceive any connection between the present list and that of the Merarites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-29.htm" title="The sons of Merari; Mahli, Libni his son, Shimei his son, Uzza his son,">1Chronicles 6:29-30</a>. The series there is:<p>Mahli, Libni, Shimei, Uzza, Shimea, Haggiah, and Asaiah.<p>Here we have:<p>Mushi, Mahli, Shamer, Bani, Amzi, Hilkiah, Amaziah, Hashabiah, Malluch, Abdi, Kishi, and Ethan.<p>Now it is quite possible that both lines spring from Mushi son of Merari. We have only to suppose that the name of Mushi has either dropped out or been omitted by design in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-29.htm" title="The sons of Merari; Mahli, Libni his son, Shimei his son, Uzza his son,">1Chronicles 6:29</a>. In that case, of course, Mahli in each line becomes identical. Next we remark that Libni in Hebrew adds but one letter (1) to Bani; and these two may be variants of the same name. The second line is again more complete than the first, as it supplies Shamer (Shemer) between Mahli and Bani-Libni. Further. Uzzi and Amzi express the same idea—that of strength—and may therefore indicate identity of person. The names Shimei and Shimeah are perhaps inadvertent duplicates of each other; which may also be the case with Amzi and Amaziah in the second series. Haggiah perhaps answers to Hilkiah.<p>Thus it may be right to regard this pedigree of Ethan as related to the Merarite line of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-29.htm" title="The sons of Merari; Mahli, Libni his son, Shimei his son, Uzza his son,">1Chronicles 6:29-30</a>, in the same way as those of Heman and Asaph are related to the first drafts of the Kohathite and Gershonite lines of descent, although the connection is not so evident in the present instance, owing perhaps to corruption of the text.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-48.htm" title="Their brothers also the Levites were appointed to all manner of service of the tabernacle of the house of God.">1Chronicles 6:48-49</a> constitute the transition from the pedigrees of the three Levitical choir-masters to the line of the sons of Aaron—Eleazar, which is here repeated from Aaron to Ahimaaz. The form of the list is, however, different. Instead of “Eleazar <span class= "ital">begat</span> Phinehas,” it runs “Phinehas <span class= "ital">his son</span>” &c. It is more likely that the chronicler found this list already connected with what follows in the source which he used for this section, than that he merely chose to repeat part of what he had already given under a slightly altered form.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_chronicles/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm" title="And their brothers the sons of Merari stood on the left hand: Ethan the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch,">1 Chronicles 6:44</a></span>. <span class="ital">The sons of Merari stood on the left hand — </span>The children of the next son of Levi are here mentioned, who had the lowest place assigned them, because they were of the youngest family.

The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ethan - Or Jeduthun (see the margin).

This passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a> are the leading passages for this name Ethan. But in succeeding references (and they are not a few) to the three chief leaders of song, the name appears as Jeduthun; unless, as seems scarcely credible, two different persons are designated. The occasion and significance of the alteration of the name are not stated, however, and elude detection so far. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a> the title of "king's seer" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;</span>) is added to the name Jeduthun, which is variously spelt (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>). This arrangement of chief singers, one from each of the three branches of Levi's family, lasted unbroken to Josiah's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a>); and the representatives of Jeduthun, at all events, are mentioned in the time of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17, 18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Kishi</span>. The most frequent form of this name is Kish (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, equivalent to the Vulgate <span class="accented">Cis</span>), if, indeed, the form of this verse and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>, Kushaiah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>), are not merely the fruit of a corrupt text. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-18.htm">1 Chronicles 6:18-23</a>). "These (following three men, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan) are they who stood (in service) with their sons." The three were the heads of the three Levitic families, to whom the execution of the liturgic singing was entrusted. The names of their sons, vide <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-6</a>. The object of the following genealogies is to show their descent from Levi.

Heman is named first as being the head of the choir of singers who stood in the centre, while Asaph and his choir stood on his right hand, and on the left Ethan and his choir, so that when they sang in concert the conducting of the whole fell to Heman. His family is traced back in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33-38</a> through twenty members to "Kohath the son of Levi, then son of Israel" (Jacob).</body></html>
