The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sons of Aaron - This list, a mere repetition of that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-3.htm">1 Chronicles 6:3-8</a>, came, probably, from a different source - a source belonging to the time of David, with whom Ahimaaz (the last name on the list) was contemporary. The other list <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-15</a> came, no doubt, from a document belonging to the time of the captivity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 6:49-81.

Those that descended from him, though of the same tribe of Levi were all priests: <p>and they offered upon the altar of burnt offerings; the daily sacrifice, and all the offerings of the people brought to them: <p>and on the altar of incense; they burnt incense night and morning: and were appointed <p>for all the work of the place most holy; such as were high priests of the line of Eleazar, whose work it was to go into the most holy place once a year: <p>to make atonement for all Israel, according to all that Moses the servant of God commanded; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-1.htm">Leviticus 16:1</a> which see; and on mention of this, a list of the high priests from Aaron, in the line of Eleazar, is given, to the times of Solomon, in the four following verses, just in the same order as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Meraioth his son, Amariah his son, Ahitub his son,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29-32</a>). "And the sons of Merari their brethren (i.e., the brethren of the choirs of Heman and Asaph) on the left (i.e., forming the choir which stood on the left hand) were Ethan and his sons." As in the case of Asaph, so also in that of Ethan, &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-18.htm">1 Chronicles 6:18</a>) is omitted, but is to be supplied; when the introductory clause "and the sons of Merari" is at once explained. Ethan is a Merarite of the younger line of Mushi (see above). The name of his father is here &#1511;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a> it is &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, which latter is clearly the original form, which has been shortened into Kishi. Instead of the name Ethan (&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;) as here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>, we find in other passage a Jeduthun mentioned as third chief-musician, along with Heman and Asaph (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-41.htm">1 Chronicles 6:41</a>); from which we see that Jeduthun was another name for Ethan, probably a by-name - &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, "praiseman" - which he had received from his calling, although nothing is said in the Old Testament as to the origin of this name. His genealogy contains only twelve names to Merari, being thus still more abridged than that of Asaph.</body></html>
