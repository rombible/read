The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of Gershom - The names in this list are curiously different from those in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-41.htm">1 Chronicles 6:41-43</a>, which yet appear to represent the same line reversed. Probably both lists are more or less corrupted, and, as in many genealogies, omission is made, to reduce the number of the names to seven.

The three lists of the descendants of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari are similar to one another in plan, and in all, each name is connected with the preceding by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, "his son," but they differ greatly in the number of the names.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-20.htm">1 Chronicles 6:20-21</a><p>(6:5-6).

Those of his descendants who are here enumerated belong to the family of his oldest son Libni, which is traced down through seven generations to Jeaterai, a name not elsewhere met with. Of the intermediate names, Johath, Zimmah, and Zerah occur also among the descendants of Asaph, who is descended from the line of Shimei, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-39.htm">1 Chronicles 6:39</a>.</body></html>
