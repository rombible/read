The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of Gershom - The names in this list are curiously different from those in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-41.htm">1 Chronicles 6:41-43</a>, which yet appear to represent the same line reversed.

The families and cities of the Levites. - Vv. 1-34. Register of the families of the Levites. - This is introduced by an enumeration of the sons and grandsons of Levi (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-16.htm">1 Chronicles 6:16-19</a>), which is followed by lists of families in six lines of descent: (a) the descendants of Gershon (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-20.htm">1 Chronicles 6:20-21</a>), of Kohath (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-22.htm">1 Chronicles 6:22-28</a>), and of Merari (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29-30</a>); and (b) the genealogies of David's chief musicians (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-31.htm">1 Chronicles 6:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-32.htm">1 Chronicles 6:32</a>), of Heman the Kohathite (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33-38</a>), of Asaph the Gershonite (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-39.htm">1 Chronicles 6:39-43</a>), and of Ethan the Merarite (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44-47</a>); and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-48.htm">1 Chronicles 6:48</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-49.htm">1 Chronicles 6:49</a>, some notes as to the service performed by the other Levites and the priests are added.<p>(6:1-4). The sons of Levi are in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1</a> again enumerated as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1</a>; then in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-16.htm">1 Chronicles 6:16-22</a> the sons of these three sons, i.e., the grandsons of Levi, are introduced, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1</a> only the sons of Kohath are mentioned. The only object of this enumeration is to make quite clear the descent of the Levitic families which follow. The name of the first son of Levi is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-16.htm">1 Chronicles 6:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-17.htm">1 Chronicles 6:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-20.htm">1 Chronicles 6:20</a>, etc. of this chapter &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, which was the name of Moses' son, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-15.htm">1 Chronicles 23:15</a>.; whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1</a> and in the Pentateuch we find a different pronunciation, viz., &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;. The names of Levi's grandsons in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-17.htm">1 Chronicles 6:17-22</a> coincide with the statements of the Pentateuch, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-17.htm">Exodus 6:17-19</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-17.htm">Numbers 3:17-20</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-57.htm">Numbers 26:57</a>. Bertheau and other commentators consider the words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-17.htm">1 Chronicles 6:17</a>, "and these are the families of Levi according to their fathers," to be a "concluding subscription" to the statements of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15-17</a>, and would remove &#1493; before &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, as not compatible with this supposition. But in this he is wrong: for although the similar statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a> is a subscription, yet it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-20.htm">Numbers 3:20</a> a superscription, and must in our verse also be so understood; for otherwise the enumeration of the descendants of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, which follows, would be brought in very abruptly, without any connecting particle, and the &#1493; before &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; points to the same conclusion. </body></html>
