That passage reads (Heb.), “And unto the sons of Kohath which were left, out of the families [clans] of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half of the tribe of Manasseh, by the lot, ten cities.” The curious redundancy of the present text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm" title="And to the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities.">1Chronicles 6:61</a>, “Out of the half of the tribe of the half of Manasseh”—a phrase which occurs nowhere else—suggests bad emendation of a corrupt reading. The passage from Joshua undoubtedly gives the meaning here. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-66.htm" title="And the residue of the families of the sons of Kohath had cities of their coasts out of the tribe of Ephraim.">1Chronicles 6:66-67</a>, below.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto the sons of Kohath which were left - i. e. to such of them as were not priests.<p>Out of the half tribe ... ten cities - The half tribe furnished two cities only (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>, and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-25.htm">Joshua 21:25</a>).

The sacred historian gives an explanation (1Ch 6:66). Eight of these are mentioned, but only two of them are taken out of the half tribe of Manasseh (1Ch 6:70).
