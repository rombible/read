That of Heman names twenty ancestors for the same period of time. This is one more illustration of the common usage of overleaping names in these genealogies.<p>(39) <span class= "bld">His brother Asaph.</span>—Asaph was Heman’s brother (1) as a Levite; (2) as a choir-master.<p>The striking agreement of the line of Heman with that of the Kohathites, detailed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-22.htm" title="The sons of Kohath; Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,">1Chronicles 6:22-28</a> above, has led critics to look for a like coincidence between the line of Asaph as given here, and that of the Gershonites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-20.htm" title="Of Gershom; Libni his son, Jahath his son, Zimmah his son,">1Chronicles 6:20-21</a>. There, however, we have only seven names, here there are thirteen. Still we observe that in the former passage the three names, Jahath, Zimmah, and Zerah appear in <span class= "ital">the same order of lineal descent</span> from Gershon as in the present list; while the Adaiah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-41.htm" title="The son of Ethni, the son of Zerah, the son of Adaiah,">1Chronicles 6:41</a> obviously answers to the Iddo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-21.htm" title="Joah his son, Iddo his son, Zerah his son, Jeaterai his son.">1Chronicles 6:21</a>, and Ethni (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-41.htm" title="The son of Ethni, the son of Zerah, the son of Adaiah,">1Chronicles 6:41</a>) is in Hebrew writing not unlike Jeaterai; and we are already familiar with the fact that genealogies sometimes recur in abbreviated forms. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/7-1.htm" title="Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,">Ezra 7:1-5</a>, with the line of Aaron in the present chapter.) Upon the whole, therefore, if the suggested identifications be correct, it appears that Asaph’s pedigree has really been partially anticipated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-20.htm" title="Of Gershom; Libni his son, Jahath his son, Zimmah his son,">1Chronicles 6:20-21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_chronicles/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-39.htm" title="And his brother Asaph, who stood on his right hand, even Asaph the son of Berachiah, the son of Shimea,">1 Chronicles 6:39</a></span>. <span class="ital">His brother Asaph — </span>Asaph is here called Heman’s brother, according to the Hebrew phraseology, by which all near relations are brothers; and because he was of the same office and employment.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His brother Asaph - Not "brother" in the ordinary sense of the term, since Asaph was the son of Berachiah, and a Gershonite, not a Kohathite.

On the names of Asaph's ancestors, see notes on vers. 20, 21. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a> it seems plain that Asaph was himself a composer of psalms, and not simply either the musician or rehearser of those of David. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-18.htm">1 Chronicles 6:18-23</a>). "These (following three men, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan) are they who stood (in service) with their sons." The three were the heads of the three Levitic families, to whom the execution of the liturgic singing was entrusted. The names of their sons, vide <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-6</a>. The object of the following genealogies is to show their descent from Levi.

Heman is named first as being the head of the choir of singers who stood in the centre, while Asaph and his choir stood on his right hand, and on the left Ethan and his choir, so that when they sang in concert the conducting of the whole fell to Heman. His family is traced back in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33-38</a> through twenty members to "Kohath the son of Levi, then son of Israel" (Jacob).</body></html>
