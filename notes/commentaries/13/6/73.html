The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto the sons of Kohath which were left - i. e. to such of them as were not priests.<p>Out of the half tribe ... ten cities - The half tribe furnished two cities only (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>, and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-25.htm">Joshua 21:25</a>).

In the lapse of centuries, and from the revolutions of society, changes might have been expected to take place in the form or dialectic pronunciation of the names of those cities; and this will sufficiently account for the variations that are found in the lists as enumerated here and in an earlier book. As to these cities themselves that were assigned to the Levites, they were widely remote and separated&#8212;partly in fulfilment of Jacob's prophecy (Ge 49:7), and partly that the various districts of the country might obtain a competent supply of teachers who might instruct the people in the knowledge, and animate them to the observance, of a law which had so important a bearing on the promotion both of their private happiness and their national prosperity.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now these are their dwelling places,.... The dwelling places of the priests and Levites, assigned and given to them in the several tribes of Israel; and the account of them agrees with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1</a> with some few variations of names of places, which have been there observed: see the notes there; only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-57.htm">1 Chronicles 6:57</a> two cities are omitted, Juttah and Gibeon, through want of care in transcribing, since they are said to be "thirteen", as they should be, whereas eleven only are mentioned. The Jews say (h), the cities of the suburbs (those here mentioned) ceased from the time the first temple was destroyed; and yet Ezra, who lived after the captivity, and the building the second temple, here gives a very particular account of them; the suburbs belonging to every city, which he particularly mentions, were 2000 cubits, both to the cities of refuge, and the rest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a> Hebron, the first city mentioned in the next verse, was a city of refuge, and had suburbs of such a space; and it is remarkable, that some of the temples with the Heathens, which were asylums, or places of refuge, had the space of 2000 paces assigned them for the same sanctity and privilege (i). <p>(h) T.

Before <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-54.htm">1 Chronicles 6:54</a> a whole verse has been lost, which was as follows: "And of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh and her pastures, Gibbethon and her pastures;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-23.htm">Joshua 21:23</a>. Then follows <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-69.htm">1 Chronicles 6:69</a>, which contains the names of the two other cities of the tribe of Dan.
