The word “minstrel” is more appropriate than “singer” because the original term (<span class= "ital">ham’shôrēr</span>) implies singing which the singer himself accompanies with an instrument of music. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-6.htm" title="All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.">1Chronicles 25:6</a>; LXX., <span class= "greekheb">ὁ ψαλτῳδὸς</span><span class= "ital">.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Son of Joel, the son of Shemuel.</span>—It is interesting to learn that Heman, the great minstrel, was a grandson of Samuel the great prophet.

Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Heman - In general Asaph takes precedence of Heman and Jeduthun, but here Heman is placed first, because his family, that of the Kohathites, had the highest priestly rank, being the family which furnished the high priests (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-2.htm">1 Chronicles 6:2-15</a>).<p>Shemuel - i. e.

So the place of Heman was still the place of honor, in the centre, with Asaph on the right and Ethan on the left (vers. 39, 44). <span class="cmt_word">Heman</span> is the twenty-first according to this list (vers. 33-38) after Levi, but the genealogy is indistinct (see above, vers. 22-28) between <span class="cmt_word">Shemuel</span> and Assir, and according to Hervey ('Genealogies of our Lord,' p. 214), Heman comes fourteenth after Levi. This Heman is to be distinguished from Heman the "son of Zerah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>), and with but little doubt, therefore, from Heman the Ezrahite (Zerahite) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>. On the other hand, a theory has been suggested by Lord Arthur C. Hervey which might reconcile the two. He supposes that if Heman the Kohathite (or his father) had married an heiress of the house of Zerah, he might have become reckoned in the line of Zerah as well as in that of Kohath. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10-15</a>). "And the sons of Elkanah, Amasai and Ahimoth." As it is clear that with &#1488;&#1500;&#1511; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; a new list begins, and that the preceding enumeration is that of the descendants of Abiasaph, it is at once suggested that this Elkanah was the brother of the Abiasaph mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15</a>. If, however, we compare the genealogy of Heman, we find there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-36.htm">1 Chronicles 6:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-35.htm">1 Chronicles 6:35</a>) a list of the descendants of Joel in an ascending line, thus, - Elkanah, Amasai, Mahath, Elkanah, Zuph; from which it would seem to follow that our Elkanah is the son of Moel mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-36.htm">1 Chronicles 6:36</a>, for Ahimoth may be without difficulty considered to be another form of the name Mahath. This conclusion would be assured if only the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-26.htm">1 Chronicles 6:26</a> were in harmony with it. In this verse, indeed, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, as we read in the Kethibh, may be without difficulty taken to mean that Elkanah was the son of Ahimoth, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-20.htm">1 Chronicles 6:20</a> Elkanah is introduced as son of Mahath. But in this way no meaning can be assigned to the &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; which follows &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, and Bertheau accordingly is of opinion that this &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; has come into the text by an error. The Masoretes also felt the difficulty, and have substituted for the Kethibh &#1489;&#1504;&#1493; the Keri &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, but then nothing can be made of the first &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-26.htm">1 Chronicles 6:26</a>. Beyond doubt the traditional text is here corrupt, and from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-35.htm">1 Chronicles 6:35</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-34.htm">1 Chronicles 6:34</a> the only conclusion we can draw with any certainty is that the list from &#1510;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497; onwards contains the names of descendants of Elkanah the son of Mahath, which is so far favourable to the Keri &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. The name Elkanah, on the contrary, which immediately precedes &#1489;&#1504;&#1493;, seems to point to a hiatus in the text, and gives room for the conjecture that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a> the sons of Elkanah, the brother of Abiasaph and Assir, were named, and that there followed thereupon an enumeration of the sons or descendants of the Elkanah whom we meet with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-36.htm">1 Chronicles 6:36</a> as son of Joel, after which came the names Elkanah &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, Zophai &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, etc. &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;&#1489; we consider to be other forms of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1495; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-34.htm">1 Chronicles 6:34</a>, and &#1510;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497; is only another form of &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;. The succeeding names, Jeroham and Elkanah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-27.htm">1 Chronicles 6:27</a>), agree with those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-34.htm">1 Chronicles 6:34</a>; but between the clauses "Elkanah his son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-27.htm">1 Chronicles 6:27</a>), and "and the sons of Samuel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-28.htm">1 Chronicles 6:28</a>), the connecting link &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>, is again wanting, as is also, before or after &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-28.htm">1 Chronicles 6:28</a>), the name of the first-born, viz., Joel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-2.htm">1 Samuel 8:2</a>. Now, although the two last-mentioned omissions can be supplied, they yet show that the enumeration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-22.htm">1 Chronicles 6:22</a> is not a continuous list of one Kohathite family, but contains only fragments of several Kohathite genealogies. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-30.htm">1 Chronicles 6:30</a>, descendants of Merari follow; sons of Mahli in six generations, who are not mentioned elsewhere. Bertheau compares this list of names, Mahli, Libni, Shimei, Uzza, Shimea, Haggiah, and Asaiah, with the list contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44</a>, Mushi, Mahli, Shamer, Bani, Amzi, Hilkiah, and Amaziah, and attempts to maintain, notwithstanding the great difference in the names, that the two lists were originally identical, in order to find support for the hypothesis "that the three lists in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-20.htm">1 Chronicles 6:20</a> have not found a place in the Chronicle from their own intrinsic value, or, in other words, have not been introduced there in order to give a register of the ancestors of Jeaterai, the sons of Samuel and Asaiah, but have been received only because they bring us to Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-34.htm">1 Chronicles 6:34</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-39.htm">1 Chronicles 6:39</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44</a>, in another fashion than the lists of names in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>." But this hypothesis is shown to be false, apart altogether from the other objections which might be raised against it, by the single fact of the total discrepancy between the names of the Merarites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-30.htm">1 Chronicles 6:30</a> and those found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44-47</a>. Of all the six names only Mahli is found in both cases, and he is carefully distinguished in both - in the genealogy of Ethan as the son of Mushi and grandson of Merari; in our list as the son of Merari. When we remember that Merari had two sons, Mahli and Mushi, after whom the father's-houses into which his descendants divided themselves were named (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-20.htm">Numbers 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-58.htm">Numbers 26:58</a>), and that the same names very frequently occur in different families, it would never suggest itself to any reader of our register to identify the line of Mushi with the line of Mahli, seeing that, except the name of Mahli the son of Mushi, which is the same as that of his uncle, all the other names are different. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-30.htm">1 Chronicles 6:30</a> contain a register of the family of Mahli, while the ancestors of Ethan, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44-47</a>, belonged to the family of Mushi. Our list then absolutely cannot be intended to form a transition to Ethan or Ethan's ancestors. The same may be said of the two other lists <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-20.htm">1 Chronicles 6:20-22</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-23.htm">1 Chronicles 6:23-28</a>, and this transition hypothesis is consequently a mere airspun fancy. The three lists are certainly not embodied in the Chronicle on account of the persons with whose names they end-Jeaterai, the sons of Samuel, and Asaiah; but the author of the Chronicle has thought them worthy of being received into his work as registers of ancient families of the three sons of Levi which had been transmitted from ancient times. </body></html>
