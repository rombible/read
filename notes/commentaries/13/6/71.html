The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto the sons of Kohath which were left - i. e. to such of them as were not priests.<p>Out of the half tribe ... ten cities - The half tribe furnished two cities only (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>, and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-25.htm">Joshua 21:25</a>).

In the lapse of centuries, and from the revolutions of society, changes might have been expected to take place in the form or dialectic pronunciation of the names of those cities; and this will sufficiently account for the variations that are found in the lists as enumerated here and in an earlier book. As to these cities themselves that were assigned to the Levites, they were widely remote and separated&#8212;partly in fulfilment of Jacob's prophecy (Ge 49:7), and partly that the various districts of the country might obtain a competent supply of teachers who might instruct the people in the knowledge, and animate them to the observance, of a law which had so important a bearing on the promotion both of their private happiness and their national prosperity.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now these are their dwelling places,....

They are found also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-8.htm">Joshua 21:8-9</a>, as a superscription before the enumeration by name of the cities assigned to the priests; but how the confusion has arisen in our text cannot be certainly ascertained. Bertheau thinks "the wish to make mention of the cities of the high-priestly family at the beginning of the enumeration, has induced the author of the Chronicle to communicate the introductory remarks belonging to the lists of cities with other statements as to the tribal domains, only after the enumeration of the cities of the sons of Aaron." By that supposition the position of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a> is certainly explained, but not that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-64.htm">1 Chronicles 6:64</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-65.htm">1 Chronicles 6:65</a>; for even with the supposed desire, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-64.htm">1 Chronicles 6:64</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-65.htm">1 Chronicles 6:65</a> should have been placed before <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a>.

The plurals &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, instead of the singulars &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-9.htm">Joshua 21:9</a>, bring the words into more manifest correspondence with the circumstances, since the subject of &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, "the sons of Israel," may be easily supplied from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-53.htm">1 Chronicles 6:53</a>, and many names of cities are mentioned. The masc. &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1501; instead of the fem. &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1503; is probably only an oversight. With <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-66.htm">1 Chronicles 6:66</a> begins the enumeration of the cities of the other Levitic families only summarily given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a>, which forms a very suitable continuation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-63.htm">1 Chronicles 6:63</a>.</body></html>
