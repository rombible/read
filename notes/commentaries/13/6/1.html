How many centuries that interval comprises is uncertain. The Exodus has been placed at various dates from 1648 B.C. (<span class= "ital">Hales</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and 1491 (<span class= "ital">Usher</span>) to <span class= "ital">circ.</span> 1330 (<span class= "ital">Lepsius</span> and other modern scholars), and even so late as 1265. It is premature, therefore, to object, as some have done, that twenty-two generations are too few for the period they are supposed to cover. If the later dates assigned for the Exodus be nearer the truth, an allowance of about thirty years to the generation would justify the list. At least we have no right to say that the list <span class= "ital">requires</span> a reckoning of forty or fifty years to the generation. On the other hand, it may well be the case that some links in the chain are wanting.

The list before us appears to ignore the line of Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining son. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/24-1.htm" title="Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.">1Chronicles 24:1-6</a>, however, proves that the chronicler was well aware that there had been other personages of high-priestly rank besides those registered here (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-5.htm" title="And Abishua begat Bukki, and Bukki begat Uzzi,">1Chronicles 6:5</a> : “for there had been princes of the sanctuary and princes of God, of the sons of Eleazar and of the sons of Ithamar”). The line of Eleazar alone is here recorded as being at once the elder and legitimate, and also the permanent one from the time of Solomon onwards.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Uzzi</span> is assumed to have been contemporary with Eli, whose immediate descendants to the fourth generation exercised the office of the high-priest, according to the data of the Books of Samuel and Kings. The line of Eli is as follows: Eli, Phinehas, Ahitub, Ahimelech, Abiathar. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-28.htm" title="Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.">1Samuel 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-4.htm" title="The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.">1Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-11.htm" title="And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.

That the line of Eleazar abstained from the priestly functions during the ascendency of the house of Ithamar-Eli, is probably nothing more than a groundless guess on the part of Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antiq. viii.</span> 1, 3). The indications of the Scriptures point the other way. Zadok and Abiathar enjoyed a co-ordinate authority in the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-25.htm" title="And the king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.">1Samuel 20:25</a>), and proofs are not wanting of the existence of more than one recognised sanctuary, in which the representatives of both houses might severally officiate. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,">1Chronicles 16:39</a>.)<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Zadok</span> was appointed sole high-priest by Solomon, who deposed Abiathar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-27.htm" title="So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.">1Kings 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-35.htm" title="And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.">1Kings 2:35</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ahimaaz.</span>—<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-36.htm" title="Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them you shall send to me every thing that you can hear.">2Samuel 15:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2Samuel 17:17</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-27.htm" title="And the watchman said, Me thinks the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good tidings.">2Samuel 18:27</a>. In all these passages Ahimaaz appears as a young man and a fleet runner, who did service to David in the time of Absalom’s revolt. He nowhere appears as high-priest.<p><span class= "bld">Azariah.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-2.htm" title="And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,">1Kings 4:2</a>, which mentions “Azariah son of Zadok the priest,” in a list of Solomon’s grandees. The remark in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm" title="And Johanan begat Azariah, (he it is that executed the priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem:)">1Chronicles 6:10</a>, “he who served as priest in the house that Solomon built in Jerusalem,” enigmatical where it stands, is intelligible if connected with Azariah son of Ahimaaz; contrasting him with his grandfather, Zadok, who had ministered at <span class= "ital">Gibeon</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,">1Chronicles 16:39</a>); and with the other high-priests who were his namesakes, as the <span class= "ital">first</span> Azariah. Solomon reigned forty years. Azariah, therefore, may have succeeded to the priesthood before his death.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">Johanan begat Azariah.</span>—Johanan is un. known. The name Azariah occurs thrice in the present list—viz., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-9.htm" title="And Ahimaaz begat Azariah, and Azariah begat Johanan,">1Chronicles 6:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-13.htm" title="And Shallum begat Hilkiah, and Hilkiah begat Azariah,">1Chronicles 6:13</a>. We have already identified the first with the son, or rather grandson, of Zadok, who is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-2.htm" title="And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,">1Kings 4:2</a>. A high-priest (Azariah) withstood King Uzziah’s assumption of priestly privilege (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm" title="And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:">2Chronicles 26:17</a>), <span class= "ital">circ.</span> 740 B.C. The Jewish exegetes Rashi and Kimchi supposed him to be identical with Azariah son of Johanan, fancifully explaining the remark, “he it is that executed the priest’s office in the temple,” &c., as a reference to his bold defence of the priestly prerogative against the king himself. If this were right, several names would be omitted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-9.htm" title="And Ahimaaz begat Azariah, and Azariah begat Johanan,">1Chronicles 6:9-10</a>. But we have seen that the remark in question really belongs to a former Azariah, and has been transposed from its original position in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-9.htm" title="And Ahimaaz begat Azariah, and Azariah begat Johanan,">1Chronicles 6:9</a> by the inadvertence of some copyist. Another Azariah is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-10.htm" title="And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.">2Chronicles 31:10</a>) as “chief priest of the house of Zadok,” early in the reign of Hezekiah. Him, too, we fail to identify with either of the Azariahs of the present list. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-13.htm" title="And Shallum begat Hilkiah, and Hilkiah begat Azariah,">1Chronicles 6:13</a>, Note.)<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Azariah begat Amariah.</span>—Perhaps the Amariah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-11.htm" title="And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.">2Chronicles 19:11</a>, who was high-priest under Jehoshaphat.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Shallum.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-8.htm" title="And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,">1Chronicles 6:8</a> : “And Ahitub begat Zadok.” The recurrence of names in the same families is almost too common to require notice, except where confusion of distinct persons has resulted or is likely to result, as in the instance of those among our Lord’s immediate followers, who bore the names of Simon, Judas, and James.<p>Somewhere about this part of the list we miss the name of Jehoiada, the famous king-maker, who put down Athaliah and set up Joash (2 Chronicles 23). In like manner, Urijah, the too compliant high-priest of the reign of Ahaz, who flourished a generation or so later, is conspicuous here by omission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10-16</a>).<p>Urijah <span class= "ital">may</span> have been omitted because of his unworthy connivance in an unlawful worship, not, however, as “an unimportant man,” as Keil thinks. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-2.htm" title="And I took to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.">Isaiah 8:2</a>.) But if the list is a list of actual high-priests, Jehoiada can only have been omitted by accident, unless indeed he is represented in it by an unrecognised <span class= "ital">alias.</span> Double names are common in Scripture, from Jacob-Israel, Esau-Edom, downwards.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Hilkiah begat Azariah.</span>—Hilkiah is probably the well-known high-priest who “found the Book of the Law” which led to the great reformation of Josiah’s reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm" title="And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.">2Kings 22:8</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Azariah, his son, is not elsewhere mentioned. The Azariah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-10.htm" title="And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.">2Chronicles 31:10</a>, who figures as high-priest under Hezekiah, at least eighty years earlier, is absent from this list.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">Seraiah begat Jehozadak.</span>—Seraiah was still high-priest at the moment of the fall of Jerusalem (588 B.C. ). Nebuchadnezzar caused him to be put to death at Riblah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-18.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">2Kings 25:18-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">Jeremiah 52:24</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>.) From Azariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm" title="And Johanan begat Azariah, (he it is that executed the priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem:)">1Chronicles 6:10</a>) <span class= "ital">to</span> Seraiah we find only ten names. In the list of the kings of Judah for about the same interval eighteen names occur (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/3-10.htm" title="And Solomon's son was Rehoboam, Abia his son, Asa his son, Jehoshaphat his son,">1Chronicles 3:10-16</a>). This fact undoubtedly suggests the omission of some generations from the list before us.<p>The use of the word “begat” throughout the series is not to be pressed to the contrary conclusion. Like the term “son” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-3.htm" title="The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,">Ezra 7:3</a> (“Azariah, <span class= "ital">son</span> of Meraioth,” though six intermediate names are given in Chron.), it is a somewhat elastic technical formula in these genealogies.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">And Jehozadak went into captivity.</span>—The Heb. is <span class= "ital">went away.</span> Our version rightly supplies <span class= "ital">into captivity.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm" title="Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>.) Jehozadak was presumably a child at the time; half a century later a son of his, the high-priest Jeshua or Joshua, returned with Zerubbabel at the head of the first colony of restored exiles, 536 B.C. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm" title="In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,">Haggai 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm" title="Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.">Ezra 3:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">When the Lord carried away Judah and Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar.</span>—The chronicler is generally charged with a strong Levitical and priestly bias, in unfavourable contrast to the “prophetical<span class= "ital">”</span> tendency of the writers of Samuel and Kings. The sentiment of this verse, however, and of many other passages, is thoroughly accordant with the point of view of the greater prophets.

After an account of the chief of the tribes of Judah and Simeon, of Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, follows that of Levi, and his posterity; the kingdom being given to Judah, the birthright to Joseph, and the priesthood to Levi: the immediate sons of Levi were <p>Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a>, from these sprung the three families of the Levites. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-1.htm" title="The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari....">1 Chronicles 6:1-15</a> (= <span class="bld">5:27–41</span> according to the Heb. division).

(1) In the first place allowing 20 years for each generation mentioned we get a space of 440 years only from the Mosaic age to the Captivity. The real interval must have been not less (and was probably much more) than 700 years. (2) In the second place some priests (doubtless highpriests) mentioned in the course of history find no place here, e.g. Eli, Ahimelech (son of Ahitub), Abiathar (David’s fellow-exile), Azariah (the contemporary of the leper-king Uzziah), Urijah (the contemporary of king Ahaz), and Azariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-10.htm" title="And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.">2 Chronicles 31:10</a>).
