The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The genealogy of the high priestly stem to the captivity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>1Ch 6:1-48.

According to Josephus (e), and other Jewish writers (f), in the times of Uzzi, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-6.htm">1 Chronicles 6:6</a> the priesthood was translated into the family of Ithamar, of which Eli was the first high priest; where it continued to the times of Solomon, when it was restored to Zadok, of the line of Eleazar. It is particularly observed of Azariah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a> that he it was that executed the priest's office in the temple built by Solomon; not that he was the first that officiated in it, that was Zadok; but this seems to be Azariah, who was the high priest in the times of Uzziah, who opposed him when he would have offered incense in the temple, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17</a>, which may be the reason why he is so particularly taken notice of here; though some think this is to be understood of Johanan, the father of Azariah, supposed to the same with Jehoiada, who, in the times of Athaliah, was the instrument of preserving both church and state, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>, the temple in which he ministered is described as built by Solomon, because at the time of the writing of this there was another temple built, or building, by Zerubbabel. <p>(e) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 11. sect. 5.
