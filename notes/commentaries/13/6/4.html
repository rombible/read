The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The genealogy of the high priestly stem to the captivity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>1Ch 6:1-48.

Very memorable persons: Aaron was the high priest, Moses the prophet and lawgiver, and Miriam a prophetess, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/6-4.htm">Micah 6:4</a>, <p>the sons also of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar; the two first were destroyed by fire from heaven for offering strange fire, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a> and the third succeeded his father in the high priesthood; the line of which is drawn from Aaron through him unto the Babylonish captivity, from hence to the end of the fifteenth verse, where it ends: Jehozadak is the same with Josedech, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> who went young into Babylon, and whose son Joshua, born in the captivity, came out of it on the proclamation of Cyrus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>. According to Josephus (e), and other Jewish writers (f), in the times of Uzzi, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-6.htm">1 Chronicles 6:6</a> the priesthood was translated into the family of Ithamar, of which Eli was the first high priest; where it continued to the times of Solomon, when it was restored to Zadok, of the line of Eleazar. It is particularly observed of Azariah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a> that he it was that executed the priest's office in the temple built by Solomon; not that he was the first that officiated in it, that was Zadok; but this seems to be Azariah, who was the high priest in the times of Uzziah, who opposed him when he would have offered incense in the temple, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17</a>, which may be the reason why he is so particularly taken notice of here; though some think this is to be understood of Johanan, the father of Azariah, supposed to the same with Jehoiada, who, in the times of Athaliah, was the instrument of preserving both church and state, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>, the temple in which he ministered is described as built by Solomon, because at the time of the writing of this there was another temple built, or building, by Zerubbabel. <p>(e) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 11. sect. 5.

From this name inclusive follow the twenty-two, which terminate with Jehozadak, who indeed never attained him s elf to the office of high priest, but was son of Geraiah, last high priest before the Captivity, and father of Jeshua, high priest, who returned with Zerubbabel from the Captivity. It has been pointed out by Lord A. C. Hervey that the name Jehozadak is of the same meaning with Zedekiah, the last king before the Captivity; and that Jeshua is the same in meaning with Joshua, the leader of the tribes into Canaan. The two elder brothers of Eleazar, viz. Nadab and Abihu, died without issue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-28.htm">Numbers 20:28</a>; ch. 24:1-3). It is somewhat obscurely said that the sacred office remained in the family of Eleazar till, in the person of Eli, it passed awhile into that of Ithamar, his brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26, 27</a>; Josephus, 8:1, &sect; 3), to be recovered again in the Zadok of our ver. 9 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Phinehas</span>; a memorable man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-30.htm">Psalm 106:30, 31</a>; which Grove well compares with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abishua</span>; only mentioned in this chapter and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1-5</a>. Josephus (8:1, &sect; 3) asserts that he it was who was succeeded in the high priesthood, not by any one of his own descendants, but by Eli, till Zedok, in the time of David, all the intervening members of the Eleazar family being private individuals. But no reliance can be placed on this assertion, for see Josephus again (5:11, &sect; 5). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Seven heads of fathers'-houses of the half-tribe of Manasseh are enumerated, and characterized as valiant heroes and famous men.

Nothing has been handed down as to any of these names.</body></html>
