The same title of inferiority might cover a relation of dependence, something like that of the clients of the great Roman houses. The name Ephah occurred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-33.htm" title="And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these are the sons of Keturah.">1Chronicles 1:33</a> as a tribe of the Midianites. It is likely, therefore, that we have before us a record of the admixture of a Midianite element with the southern Judeans.<p><span class= "bld">Haran.</span>—Abraham’s brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-26.htm" title="And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.">Genesis 11:26</a>); a place in Mesopotamia where Abraham settled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31</a>). It is the Assyrian <span class= "ital">harranu</span> (high-road). The Midianites claimed descent from Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-33.htm" title="And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these are the sons of Keturah.">1Chronicles 1:33</a>), this name therefore might well be borne by a semi-Midianite clan.<p><span class= "bld">Moza.</span>—Occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm" title="And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,">Joshua 18:26</a> as a town in Benjamin.<p><span class= "bld">Haran</span> <span class= "bld">begat Gazez.</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-24.htm" title="And after that Hezron was dead in Calebephratah, then Abiah Hezron's wife bore him Ashur the father of Tekoa.">1Chronicles 2:24</a>, Note.

It is curious to find the Midianite name Ephah recurring among them.<p>(48) <span class= "bld">Maachah, Caleb’s concubine, bare</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>—The Heb. is peculiar, “Caleb’s concubine Maachah—he bare Sheber,” &c. There is another reading, “she bare.” Maachah was a well-known Syrian state (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;">2Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-43.htm" title="Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,">1Chronicles 11:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/19-6.htm" title="And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.">1Chronicles 19:6-7</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-23.htm" title="And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.">2Kings 25:23</a>.) These Calebites, it would seem, were of partly Aramean origin. The masculine verb “he bare” is intelligible if Maachah means not a woman, but a race. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-15.htm" title="And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city.

But this number also is obtained only by taking into account the father and mother of Amasa as two persons, contrary to the rule according to which only the father, without the mother, is to be counted, or, in case the mother be more famous than the father, or be an heiress, only the mother.)<p> - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-34.htm">1 Chronicles 2:34-41</a> there follows the family of Sheshan, which was originated by the marriage of his daughter with his Egyptian slave, and which is continued through thirteen generations. The name of this daughter is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-25.htm">1 Chronicles 2:25</a>. not mentioned, but she is without doubt the Ahlai mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-31.htm">1 Chronicles 2:31</a>. But since this Ahlai is the tenth in descent from Judah through Pharez, she was probably born in Egypt; and the Egyptian slave Jarha was most likely a slave whom Sheshan had in Egypt, and whom he adopted as his son for the propagation of his race, by giving him his daughter and heir to wife. If this be the case, the race begotten by Jarha with the daughter of Sheshan is traced down till towards the end of the period of the judges. The Egyptian slave Jarha is not elsewhere met with; and though the names which his posterity bore are found again in various parts of the Old Testament, of none of them can it be proved that they belonged to men of this family, so as to show that one of these person shad become famous in history. </body></html>
