No place <span class="cmt_word">Caleb-ephratah</span> is known, and no sort of accounting for Hezron dying anywhere but in Egypt, whither he went with Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>), is producible. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">Ingressus est Caleb ad Ephratam</span>, but our Hebrew text cannot be made to justify it, if for nothing else, for want of a preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> before "Ephrata." This reading of the Vulgate has suggested to others that by a slight but still gratuitous alteration of our Hebrew text <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> might be substituted for the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to the name of Caleb; but upon <span class="accented">that</span> showing we have to <span class="accented">suppose</span> that Caleb did leave Egypt on his own account and travel to Ephratah, and then there fails any strong connection (but see Septuagint, in <span class="accented">loc.</span>) between that fact and what is said about <span class="cmt_word">Abiah</span>. Still, the explanation might receive some countenance from the fact that it is said that Abiah's son became the father - or <span class="accented">founder - <span class="cmt_word"></span>of</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Tekoa</span>, a place near Bethlehem, in South Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). Bertheau has at this point suggested that Caleb-ephratah, instead of being included in Neger-Caleb, may rather, in <span class="accented">distinction</span> from it, designate the northern portion of the territory of Caleb. The solution of the problem will probably not yield to anything but a justly restored text. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The family of Caleb. - That &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; is merely a shortened form of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;, or a form of that word resulting from the friction of constant use, is so clear from the context, that all exegetes recognise it. We have first (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18-20</a>) a list of the descendants of Caleb by two wives, then descendants which the daughter of the Gileadite Machir bore to his father Hezron (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21-23</a>), and finally the sons whom Hezron's wife bore him after his death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-24.htm">1 Chronicles 2:24</a>). The grouping of these descendants of Hezron with the family of Caleb can only be accounted for by supposing that they had, through circumstances unknown to us, come into a more intimate connection with the family of Caleb than with the families of his brothers Ram and Jerahmeel. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42-55</a> follow some other lists of descendants of Caleb, which will be more fully considered when we come to these verses. The first half of the 18th verse is obscure, and the text is probably corrupt. As the words stand at present, we must translate, "Caleb the son of Hezron begat with Azubah, a woman, and with Jerioth, and these are her (the one wife's) sons, Jesher," etc. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, filii ejus, suggests that only one wife of Caleb had been before mentioned; and, as appears from the "and Azubah died" of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-19.htm">1 Chronicles 2:19</a>, Azubah is certainly meant. The construction &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;, "he begat with," is, it is true, unusual, but is analogous to &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; &#1502;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-9.htm">1 Chronicles 8:9</a>, and is explained by the fact that &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; may mean to cause to bear, to bring to bearing; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-9.htm">Isaiah 66:9</a> : therefore properly it is, "he brought Azubah to bearing." The difficulty of the verse lies in the &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, for, according to the usual phraseology, we would have expected &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; instead of &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;. But &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; may be, under the circumstances, to some extent justified by the supposition that Azubah is called indefinitely "woman," because Caleb had several wives. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; gives no suitable meaning. The explanation of Kimchi, "with Azubah a woman, and with Jerioth," cannot be accepted, for only the sons of Azubah are hereafter mentioned; and the idea that the children of the other wives are not enumerated here because the list used by the chronicler was defective, is untenable: for after two wives had been named in the enumeration of the children of one of them, the mother must necessarily have been mentioned; and so, instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, we should have had &#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. Hiller and J. H. Michaelis take &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; as explicative, "with Azubah a woman, viz., with Jerioth;" but this is manifestly only the product of exegetical embarrassment. The text is plainly at fault, and the easiest conjecture is to read, with the Peschito and the Vulgate, &#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; instead of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, "he begat with Azubah his wife, Jerioth (a daughter); and these are her sons." In that case &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; would be added to &#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, to guard against &#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; being taken for acc. obj. The names of the sons of Azubah, or of her daughter Jerioth, do not occur elsewhere.</body></html>
