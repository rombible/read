But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>David the seventh - Jesse had eight sons, of whom David was the youngest <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-10.htm">1 Samuel 16:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>.

Nothing more is said of the remaining sons of Zerah; they are merely set down as famous men of antiquity (Berth.). There follows in <p><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9-41</a><p>The family of Hezron, the first-born son of Pharez, which branches off in three lines, originating with his three sons respectively. The three sons of Hezron are Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai; but the families springing from them are enumerated in a different order. First (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-10.htm">1 Chronicles 2:10-17</a>) we have the family of Ram, because King David is descended from him; then (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18-24</a>) the family of Chelubai or Caleb, from whose lineage came the illustrious Bezaleel; and finally (vv. 25-41), the posterity of the first-born, Jerahmeel.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a><p>&#1500;&#1493; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, what was born to him. The passive stands impersonally instead of the more definite active, "to whom one bore," so that the following names are subordinated to it with &#1488;&#1514;. The third person singular Niph. occurs thus also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-4.htm">1 Chronicles 3:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-6.htm">1 Chronicles 26:6</a>; the construction of Niph. with &#1488;&#1514; frequently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-5.htm">Genesis 21:5</a>, and elsewhere).
