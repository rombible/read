But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sisters - i. e. half-sisters.

David the seventh&#8212;As it appears (1Sa 16:10; 17:12) that Jesse had eight sons, the presumption is from David being mentioned here as the seventh son of his father, that one of them had died at an early age, without leaving issue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whose sisters were Zeruiah and Abigail.....

Light is thrown upon this by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>, which says that Abigail was the daughter of one Nahash, and that Zeruiah was her sister. But it is to leave us in greater darkness as to who Nahath was: whether Nahath was another name for Jesse, or the name of Jesse's wife, or the name of a former husband of Jesse's wife, to whom she bore these two daughters before she became wife to Jesse, and that former husband possibly none other than the Ammonite king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>) - or whether none of these conjectures be near the truth, some of which on the face of them seem unlikely enough, is as yet unsettled. Meantime it is worth remembering that Zeruiah named one of her celebrated sons, and probably the eldest of them, <span class="cmt_word">Abishai</span>, after Jesse, Ishai being the same as our Jesse; yet from the above premises it is taken that she was strictly sister of Abigail, and therefore was not really related to Jesse. The subject is treated interestingly under the various names in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary.' The husband of Zeruiah is given nowhere, while the husband of Abigail, here called <span class="cmt_word">Jether the Ishmeelite</span>, is, in the passage already referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>), called Ithra (which is a slightly altered form of the name), an <span class="accented">Israelite</span>, with little doubt an error for <span class="accented">Ishmaelite.</span> In the same passage also her own name appears as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, though many manuscripts have this latter. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The family of Ram (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-10.htm">1 Chronicles 2:10-12</a>), traced down through six members of Jesse. - This genealogy is also to be found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1.htm">Ruth 1</a> Chronicles <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-19.htm">Ruth 4:19-21</a>; but only here is Nahshon made more prominent than the others, by the addition, "prince of the sons of Judah." Nahshon was a prince of Judah at the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>). Now between him, a contemporary of Moses, and Pharez, who at the immigration of Jacob into Egypt was about fifteen years old, lies a period of 430 years, during which the Israelites remained in Egypt. For that time only three names - Hezron, Ram, and Amminidab - are mentioned, from which it is clear that several links must have been passed over. So also, from Nahshon to David, for a period of over 400 years, four generations - Salma, Boaz, Obed, and Jesse - are too few; and consequently here also the less famous ancestors of David are omitted. &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488; is called in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-20.htm">Ruth 4:20-21</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13-15</a>, seven sons and two daughters of Jesse, with those of their sons who became famous (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-16.htm">1 Chronicles 2:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>), are enumerated. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>, Jesse had eight sons. This account, which agrees with that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-8.htm">1 Samuel 16:8-12</a>, may be reconciled with the enumeration in our verse, on the supposition that one of the sons died without posterity. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-13.htm">1 Chronicles 17:13</a>, the names of the eldest three - Eliab, Abinadab, and Shammah - occur. Besides &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, we meet with the form &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>); and the name &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is only another form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492;, which is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3</a> and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-7.htm">1 Chronicles 20:7</a>, and is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-32.htm">2 Samuel 13:32</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-21.htm">2 Samuel 21:21</a> in the Kethibh (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;). The names of the other three sons here mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-14.htm">1 Chronicles 2:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-15.htm">1 Chronicles 2:15</a>) are met with nowhere else.</body></html>
