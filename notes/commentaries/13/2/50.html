The recognition of the ethnographical and geographical significance of these expressions at once removes all difficulty. Salma was the principal clan established in Bethlehem-Ephratah; branches of which were settled at Netophah, a neighbouring township (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-16.htm" title="And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelled in the villages of the Netophathites.">1Chronicles 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/23-28.htm" title="Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,">2Samuel 23:28-29</a>), important after the return (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-22.htm" title="The men of Netophah, fifty and six.">Ezra 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-26.htm" title="The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, an hundred fourscore and eight.">Nehemiah 7:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ataroth, the house of Joab.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">Atroth-beth-Joab</span> (comp.

The word really belongs to the next verse, as the sons of Salma are arranged in pairs.<p>(55) <span class= "bld">The families</span> (<span class= "ital">mishpehôth=</span>clans) <span class= "bld">of the scribes which dwelt at Jabez.</span>—Among the clans calling themselves sons of Salma were three groups of Sopherim (Authorised version, “scribes”) settled at Jabez (Heb., <span class= "ital">Ia‘bêç</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> a town of northern Judah, near to Zorah. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-9.htm" title="And Jabez was more honorable than his brothers: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bore him with sorrow.">1Chronicles 4:9</a>, Note.) The three clans were known as those of Tir‘ah, Shimeah, and Suchah. The Vulg. treats these names as appellatives, and renders <span class= "ital">canentes atque resonantes et in tabernaculis commorantes,</span> that is, “singing and resounding, and dwelling in tents.” This translation is assumed to be due to Jerome’s Rabbinical teachers, and is justified by reference to the words <span class= "ital">terû‘āh,</span> “trumpet-blare;” <span class= "ital">shim‘āh,</span> “report;” or the Aramaic <span class= "ital">Shema‘tâ</span> “legal tradition” and <span class= "ital">sûkāh</span> (= <span class= "ital">sukkah</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> “a booth.” Hence the conclusion has been drawn that the Sopherim of Jabez were, in fact, ministers of religion, discharging functions precisely like those of the Levites. So Wellhausen, who refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.">Jeremiah 35:19</a>, and the title of Psalms 70 in the LXX., and to one or two late fragmentary notices of the Rechabites. On the face of it the supposition is unlikely; nor does it derive any real support from the Kenite origin of these Sopherim, for it is a mere fancy that the house of Jethro, the Kenite priest of Midian, became temple-ministers in Israel. Besides, the etymologies of the names are hardly cogent; and if we try to extract history from etymology here, we might as well do so in the case of the clans of Kirjath-jearim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-53.htm" title="And the families of Kirjathjearim; the Ithrites, and the Puhites, and the Shumathites, and the Mishraites; of them came the Zareathites, and the Eshtaulites,">1Chronicles 2:53</a>), and make the Ithrites a guild of ropers (<span class= "ital">yether,</span> “cord, bowstring”), the Puthites hinge-makers (<span class= "ital">pôthôth</span>—<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm" title="And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.">1Kings 1:50</a>—“hinges”), and the Shumathithes garlic-eaters (<span class= "ital">shûm,</span> “garlic,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-5.htm" title="We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:">Numbers 11:5</a>). The Vulg. often makes the blunder of translating proper names. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-52.htm" title="And Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim had sons; Haroeh, and half of the Manahethites.">1Chronicles 2:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-54.htm" title="The sons of Salma; Bethlehem, and the Netophathites, Ataroth, the house of Joab, and half of the Manahethites, the Zorites.">1Chronicles 2:54</a>).<p><span class= "bld">These are the Kenites that came of Hemath</span> (Heb., <span class= "ital">Hammath</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> <span class= "bld">the father of the house of</span> (Beth-) <span class= "bld">Rechab.</span>—The three clans of Sopherim were originally Kenites, and traced their descent from Hammath, the traditional founder of the Rechabite stock.

Now it is here not only very surprising that the sons of Mareshah stand parallel with Mesha, but it is still more strange to find such a collocation as "sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron." The last-mentioned difficulty would certainly be greatly lessened if we might take Hebron to be the city of that name, and translate the phrase "father of Hebron," lord of the city of Hebron, according to the analogy of "father of Ziph," "father of Tekoa" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-24.htm">1 Chronicles 2:24</a>), and other names of that sort. But the continuation of the genealogy, "and the sons of Hebron were Korah, and Tappuah, Rekem, and Shema" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-43.htm">1 Chronicles 2:43</a>), is irreconcilable with such an interpretation. For of these names, Tappuah, i.e., apple, is indeed met with several times as the name of a city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-17.htm">Joshua 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a>); and Rekem is the name of a city of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-27.htm">Joshua 18:27</a>), but occurs also twice as the name of a person - once of a Midianite prince (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>), and once of a Manassite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-16.htm">1 Chronicles 7:16</a>); but the other two, Korah and Shema, only occur as the names of persons. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-44.htm">1 Chronicles 2:44</a>., moreover, the descendants of Shema and Rekem are spoken of, and that, too, in connection with the word &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;, "he begat," which demonstrably can only denote the propagation of a race. We must therefore take Hebron as the name of a person, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-2.htm">1 Chronicles 6:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>. But if Hebron be the name of a man, then Mareshah also must be interpreted in the same manner. This is also required by the mention of the sons of Mareshah parallel with Mesha the first-born; but still more so by the circumstance that the interpretation of Mareshah and Hebron, as names of cities, is irreconcilable with the position of these two cities, and with their historical relations. Bertheau, indeed, imagines that as Mareshah is called the father of Hebron, the famous capital of the tribe of Judah, we must therefore make the attempt, however inadmissible it may seem at first sight, to take Mareshah, in the connection of our verse, as the name of a city, which appears as father of Hebron, and that we must also conclude that the ancient city Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23</a>) stood in some sort of dependent relationship to Mareshah, perhaps only in later time, although we cannot at all determine to what time the representation of our verse applies. But at the foundation of this argument there lies an error as to the position of the city Mareshah. Mareshah lay in the Shephelah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>), and exists at present as the ruin Marasch, twenty-four minutes south of Beit-Jibrin: vide on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; and Tobler, Dritte Wanderung, 129 and 142f. Ziph, therefore, which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a> along with Mareshah, and which is consequently the Ziph mentioned in our verse, cannot be, as Bertheau believes, the Ziph situated in the hill country of Judah, in the wilderness of that name, whose ruins are still to be seen on the hill Zif, about four miles south-east from Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a>). It can only be the Ziph in the Shephelah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-24.htm">Joshua 15:24</a>), the position of which has not indeed been discovered, but which is to be sought in the Shephelah at no great distance from Marasch, and thus far distant from Hebron. Since, then, Mareshah and Ziph were in the Shephelah, no relation of dependence between the capital, Hebron, situated in the mountains of Judah, and Mareshah can be thought of, neither in more ancient nor in later time. The supposition of such a dependence is not made probable by the remark that we cannot determine to what time the representation of our verse applies; it only serves to cover the difficulty which renders it impossible. That the verse does not treat of post-exilic times is clear, although even after the exile, and in the time of the Maccabees and the Romans, Hebron was not in a position of dependence on Marissa. Bertheau himself holds Caleb, of whose son our verses treat, for a contemporary of Moses and Joshua, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-49.htm">1 Chronicles 2:49</a> Achsa is mentioned as daughter of Caleb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-16.htm">Joshua 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-12.htm">Judges 1:12</a>). The contents of our verse would therefore have reference to the first part of the period of the judges. But since Hebron was never dependent on Mareshah in the manner supposed, the attempt, which even at first sight appeared so inadmissible, to interpret Mareshah as the name of a city, loses all its support. For this reason, therefore, the city of Hebron, and the other cities named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-43.htm">1 Chronicles 2:43</a>., which perhaps belonged to the district of Mareshah, cannot be the sons of Mareshah here spoken of; and the fact that, of the names mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-43.htm">1 Chronicles 2:43</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-44.htm">1 Chronicles 2:44</a>, at most two may denote cities, while the others are undoubtedly the names of persons, points still more clearly to the same conclusion. We must, then, hold Hebron and Mareshah also to be the names of persons.<p>Now, if the Masoretic text be correct, the use of the phrase, "and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron," instead of "and Mareshah, the sons of the father of Hebron," can only have arisen from a desire to point out, that besides Hebron there were also other sons of Mareshah who were of Caleb's lineage. But the mention of the sons of Mareshah, instead of Mareshah, and the calling him the father of Hebron in this connection, make the correctness of the traditional text very questionable. Kimchi has, on account of the harshness of placing the sons of Mareshah on a parallel with Mesha the first-born of Caleb, supposed an ellipse in the expression, and construes &#1502;&#1512; &#1493;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, et ex filiis Ziphi Mareshah. But this addition cannot be justified. If we may venture a conjecture in so obscure a matter, it would more readily suggest itself that &#1502;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is an error for &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, and that &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497; is to be taken as a nomen compos., when the meaning would be, "and the sons of Mesha were Abi-Hebron." The probability of the existence of such a name as Abihebron along with the simple Hebron has many analogies in its favour: cf. Dan and Abidan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-11.htm">Numbers 1:11</a>; Ezer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-9.htm">1 Chronicles 12:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a>, with Abi-ezer; Nadab, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm">Exodus 6:23</a>, and Abinadab. In the same family even we have Abiner, or Abner, the son of Ner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; cf. Ew. 273, S. 666, 7th edition). Abihebron would then be repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-43.htm">1 Chronicles 2:43</a>, in the shortened form Hebron, just as we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a> Tappuah, instead of En-tappuah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>. The four names introduced as sons of Hebron denote persons, not localities: cf. for Korah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-35.htm">1 Chronicles 1:35</a>, and concerning Tappuah and Rekem the above remark. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-44.htm">1 Chronicles 2:44</a> are mentioned the sons of Rekem and of Shema, the latter a frequently recurring man's name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-8.htm">1 Chronicles 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-13.htm">1 Chronicles 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-44.htm">1 Chronicles 11:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-4.htm">Nehemiah 8:4</a>). Shema begat Raham, the father of Jorkam. The name &#1497;&#1511;&#1506;&#1501; is quite unknown elsewhere. The lxx have rendered it &#x399;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd;, and Bertheau therefore holds Jorkam to be the name of a place, and conjectures that originally &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1506;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-56.htm">Joshua 15:56</a>) stood here also. But the lxx give also &#x399;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; for the following name &#1512;&#1511;&#1501;, from which it is clear that we cannot rely much on their authority. The lxx have overlooked the fact that &#1512;&#1511;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-44.htm">1 Chronicles 2:44</a>, is the son of the Hebron mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-43.htm">1 Chronicles 2:43</a>, whose descendants are further enumerated. Shammai occurs as a man's name also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-28.htm">1 Chronicles 2:28</a>, and is again met with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-17.htm">1 Chronicles 4:17</a>. His son is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-45.htm">1 Chronicles 2:45</a> Maon, and Maon is the father of Bethzur. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is certainly the city in the mountains of Judah which Rehoboam fortified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>), and which still exists in the ruin Bet-sur, lying south of Jerusalem in the direction of Hebron. Maon also was a city in the mountains of Judah, now Main (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a>); but we cannot allow that this city is meant by the name &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;, because Maon is called on the one hand the son of Shammai, and on the other is father of Bethzur, and there are no well-ascertained examples of a city being represented as son (&#1489;&#1468;&#1503;) of a man, its founder or lord, nor of one city being called the father of another. Dependent cities and villages are called daughters (not sons) of the mother city. The word &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;, "dwelling," does not per se point to a village or town, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-12.htm">Judges 10:12</a> denotes a tribe of non-Israelites. </body></html>
