But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Ahijah - There is no "and" in the original.

Machir was the first-born of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29</a>).

Machir begot a son of the name of Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29</a>); and it is clear from the genealogy of the daughters of Zelophehad, communicated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>, that this expression is to be understood in its literal sense. Machir is distinguished from other men of the same name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm">2 Samuel 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>) by the addition, father of Gilead. Segub the son of Hezron and the daughter of Machir begat Jair. This Jair, belonging on his mother's side to the tribe of Manasseh, is set down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>, as a descendant of Manasseh. After Moses' victory over Og king of Bashan, Jair's family conquered the district of Argob in Bashan, i.e., in the plain of Jaulan and Hauran; and to the conquered cities, when they were bestowed upon him for a possession by Moses, the name Havvoth-jair, i.e., Jair's-life, was given. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>, where this name is explained. These are the twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead, i.e., Pera.</body></html>
