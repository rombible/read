But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Ahijah - There is no "and" in the original.

Geshur denotes the inhabitants of a district of Aram, or Syria, on the north-western frontier of Bashan, in the neighbourhood of Hermon, on the east side of the upper Jordan, which had still its own kings in the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-37.htm">2 Samuel 13:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-23.htm">2 Samuel 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>), but which had been assigned to the Manassites by Moses; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-13.htm">Joshua 13:13</a>. The following &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1511;&#1504;&#1514; must not be taken as an explanatory apposition to &#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;: "Jair's-life, Kenath and her daughters, sixty cities" (Berth.). For since &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; refers to the collective name Jair, Geshur and Aram could not take away from Jair sixty cities, for Jair only possessed twenty-three cities. But besides this, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>, Kenath with her daughters had been conquered by Nobah, who gave his own name to the conquered cities; and according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a>, the kingdom of Og in Bashan had sixty fenced cities. But this kingdom was, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>, conquered by two families of Manasseh, by Jair and Nobah, and was divided between them; and as appears from our passage, twenty-three cities were bestowed upon Jair, and all the rest of the land, viz., Kenath with her daughters, fell to Nobah. These two domains together included sixty fenced cities, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> are called Jair's-life; while here, in our verse, only twenty-three cities are so called, and the remaining thirty-seven are comprehended under the name of Kenath had her daughters. WE must therefore either supply a w copul. before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1511;&#1504;&#1514;, or we must take &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1511; in the signification "with Kenath," and refer &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; to both Jair's-life and Kenath. Cf. herewith the discussion on <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12-14</a>; and for Kenath, the ruins of which still exist under the name Kanuat on the western slope of the Jebel Hauran, see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>. The time when these cities were taken away by the Arameans is not known. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a> we only learn that the Jair who was judge at a later time again had possession of thirty of these cities, and renewed the name Jair's-life. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is not all these sixty cities, but the before-mentioned descendants of Hezron, who are called sons, that is offspring, of Machir, because they were begotten with the daughter of Machir. Only two names, it is true, Segub and Jair, are enumerated; but from these two issue the numerous families which took Jair's-life. To these, therefore, must we refer the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;.</body></html>
