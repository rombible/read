(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm" title="And Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.">Genesis 30:6</a>.)

Of course accident may have caused the transposition of Dan with Joseph and Benjamin in our list, especially as it otherwise agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/35-3.htm" title="And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.">Genesis 35:3-4</a>.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him.

TABLE OF ISRAEL'S TWELVE SONS. The twelve sons of <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span>, not in the order of age (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31-30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-16.htm">Genesis 35:16-19</a>), nor exactly in the order of children of wives as against those of handmaids (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23-26</a>), nor in that of the aged father's dying blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>.), nor in that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-2.htm">Exodus 1:2-4</a>. It is the place of <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span> which disturbs the fittest order, and Keil suggests that his place in this text is accounted for by Rachel's desire that her handmaid's child should be accounted her own; but surely this was not exceptional, but applied to all or most of such cases, and should have been far rather taken into consideration in any of the other lists than in this. However accounted for, the order is - <span class="accented">lest</span>, the six sons of the first wife Leah; <span class="accented">secondly</span>, the elder son of Rachel's handmaid Bilhah; <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, the two sons of the loved wife Rachel; <span class="accented">fourthly</span>, the other son of Rachel's handmaid Billah; <span class="accented">lastly</span>, the two sons of Zilpah, handmaid of Leah. As this order corresponds with nothing in our Old Testament, it may serve as one slight indication that the compiler of Chronicles was not dependent on these records alone. The Hebrew text and the Septuagint accord exactly with the Authorized Version here. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The kings of Edom before the introduction of the kingship into Israel. - This is a verbally exact repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31-39</a>, except that the introductory formula, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-32.htm">Genesis 36:32</a>, "and there reigned in Edom," which is superfluous after the heading, and the addition "ben Achbor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-39.htm">Genesis 36:39</a>) in the account of the death of Baal-hanan in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-50.htm">1 Chronicles 1:50</a>, are omitted; the latter because even in Genesis, where mention is made of the death of other kings, the name of the father of the deceased king is not repeated. Besides this, the king called Hadad (v. 46f.), and the city &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (v. 50), are in Genesis Hadar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35</a>.) and &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-39.htm">Genesis 36:39</a>). The first of these variations has arisen from a transcriber's error, the other from a different pronunciation of the name. A somewhat more important divergence, however, appears, when in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-39.htm">Genesis 36:39</a> the death of the king last named is not mentioned, because he was still alive in the time of Moses; while in the Chronicle, on the contrary, not only of him also is it added, &#1492;&#1491;&#1491; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, because at the time of the writing of the Chronicle he had long been dead, but the list of the names of the territories of the phylarchs, which in Genesis follows the introductory formula &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; alum &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, is here connected with the enumeration of the kings by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, "Hadad died, and there were chiefs of Edom." This may mean that, in the view of the chronicler, the reign of the phylarchs took the place of the kingship after the death of the last king, but that interpretation is by no means necessary. The &#1493; consec. may also merely express the succession of thought, only connecting logically the mention of the princes with the enumeration of the kings; or it may signify that, besides the kings, there were also tribal princes who could rule the land and people. The contents of the register which follows require that &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; should be so understood. </body></html>
