But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Ahijah - There is no "and" in the original.

Hezron's death took place &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1489;, "in Caleb Ephrathah." This expression is obscure. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>, a part of the Negeb (south country) of Judah was called Negeb Caleb, as it belonged to the family of Caleb. According to this analogy, the town or village in which Caleb dwelt with his wife Ephrath may have been called Caleb of Ephrathah, if Ephrath had brought this place as a dower to Caleb, as in the case mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-18.htm">Joshua 15:18</a>. Ephrathah, or Ephrath, was the ancient name of Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-1.htm">Genesis 48:1</a>), and with it the name of Caleb's wife Ephrath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-19.htm">1 Chronicles 2:19</a>) is unquestionably connected; probably she was so called after her birthplace. If this supposition be well founded, then Caleb of Ephrathah would be the little town of Bethlehem. Ashur is called father (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;) of Tekoa, i.e., lord and prince, as the chief of the inhabitants of Tekoa, now Tekua, two hours south of Bethlehem (vide on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-59.htm">Joshua 15:59</a>).</body></html>
