But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Ahijah - There is no "and" in the original.

Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife&#8212;The adoption and marriage of a foreign slave in the family where he is serving, is far from being a rare or extraordinary occurrence in Eastern countries. It is thought, however, by some to have been a connection not sanctioned by the law of Moses [Michaelis]. But this is not a well-founded objection, as the history of the Jews furnishes not a few examples of foreign proselytes in the same manner obtaining an inheritance in Israel; and doubtless Jarha had previously embraced the Jewish faith in place of the grovelling idolatries of his native Egypt. In such a case, therefore, there could be no legal difficulty. Being a foreign slave, he had no inheritance in a different tribe to injure by this connection; while his marriage with Sheshan's daughter led to his adoption into the tribe of Judah, as well as his becoming heir of the family property.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife,....

These two names are abundantly interesting here. Zabad, the tenth from Jerahmeel, or fourteenth from the patriarch Judah himself, brings us to the time of David, by exactly the same interval as seven other perfect genealogies, four of these having the very same number of steps, viz. fourteen, two having fifteen, and that of David himself having eleven steps. An analogous and equally interesting correspondence can be traced with the name Azariah. See the important art. "Zabad," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary;' and its further remarks as to the evidence of the genealogy in the fact of its twenty-fourth and last name tallying well with the time of Hezekiah, the sixth king after Athaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The descendants of Jada, the brother of Shammai, in two generations, after which this genealogy closes with the subscription, "these were the sons of Jerahmeel."<p>(Note: Bertheau reckons up to "the concluding subscription in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-33.htm">1 Chronicles 2:33</a>" the following descendants of Judah: "Judah's sons  equals  5; Hezron and Hamul  equals  2; Zerah's sons  equals  5; Karmi, Akar, and Azariah  equals  3; Ram and his descendants (including the two daughters of Jesse, and Jeter the father of Amasa)  equals  21; Kaleb and his descendants  equals  10; Jerahmeel and his descendants  equals  24: together  equals  70." But this number also is obtained only by taking into account the father and mother of Amasa as two persons, contrary to the rule according to which only the father, without the mother, is to be counted, or, in case the mother be more famous than the father, or be an heiress, only the mother.)<p> - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-34.htm">1 Chronicles 2:34-41</a> there follows the family of Sheshan, which was originated by the marriage of his daughter with his Egyptian slave, and which is continued through thirteen generations. The name of this daughter is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-25.htm">1 Chronicles 2:25</a>. not mentioned, but she is without doubt the Ahlai mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-31.htm">1 Chronicles 2:31</a>. But since this Ahlai is the tenth in descent from Judah through Pharez, she was probably born in Egypt; and the Egyptian slave Jarha was most likely a slave whom Sheshan had in Egypt, and whom he adopted as his son for the propagation of his race, by giving him his daughter and heir to wife. If this be the case, the race begotten by Jarha with the daughter of Sheshan is traced down till towards the end of the period of the judges. The Egyptian slave Jarha is not elsewhere met with; and though the names which his posterity bore are found again in various parts of the Old Testament, of none of them can it be proved that they belonged to men of this family, so as to show that one of these person shad become famous in history. </body></html>
