Bezaleel is no doubt a person, but Hur is probably a Calebite clan, established at “Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm" title="And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.">Genesis 35:19</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the remainder of this chapter the writer obtains scarcely any assistance from the earlier Scriptures, and must have drawn almost entirely from genealogical sources, accessible to him, which have since perished.<p>Azubah was Caleb's wife; Jerioth his concubine.

In 1Ch 2:19 he is said to be the father of Hur, whereas in 1Ch 2:50 he is called "the son of Hur." The words in this latter passage have been transposed in the copying, and should be read thus, "Hur the son of Caleb."<p>begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth&#8212;The former was his spouse, while Jerioth seems to have been a secondary wife, and the mother of the children whose names are here given. On the death of his principal wife, he married Ephrath, and by her had Hur [1Ch 2:19].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Hur begat Uri, and Uri begat Bezaleel.

Nahshon was a prince of Judah at the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>). Now between him, a contemporary of Moses, and Pharez, who at the immigration of Jacob into Egypt was about fifteen years old, lies a period of 430 years, during which the Israelites remained in Egypt. For that time only three names - Hezron, Ram, and Amminidab - are mentioned, from which it is clear that several links must have been passed over. So also, from Nahshon to David, for a period of over 400 years, four generations - Salma, Boaz, Obed, and Jesse - are too few; and consequently here also the less famous ancestors of David are omitted. &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488; is called in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-20.htm">Ruth 4:20-21</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13-15</a>, seven sons and two daughters of Jesse, with those of their sons who became famous (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-16.htm">1 Chronicles 2:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>), are enumerated. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>, Jesse had eight sons. This account, which agrees with that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-8.htm">1 Samuel 16:8-12</a>, may be reconciled with the enumeration in our verse, on the supposition that one of the sons died without posterity. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-13.htm">1 Chronicles 17:13</a>, the names of the eldest three - Eliab, Abinadab, and Shammah - occur.
