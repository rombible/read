In the mystical body of Christ, every member has its use, for the good of the whole. Christ is High Priest over the house of God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection. In Christ, no difference is made between bond and free, elder and younger. The younger brethren, if faithful and sincere, shall be no less acceptable to Christ than the fathers. May we all be children of the Lord, fitted to sing his praises for ever in his temple above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither "Hebron" nor "the first" is found in the present Hebrew text; but they seem to have been rightly supplied by our translators from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-19.htm">1 Chronicles 23:19</a>. The four persons named appear to have been contemporaries of David, the heads of the Hebronite houses in his time (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-31.htm">1 Chronicles 26:31</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. one principal household&#8212;The marginal reading is preferable, "one house of the father." The lot was cast in a deliberate and solemn manner in presence of the king, the princes, the two high priests, and the chiefs of the priestly and Levitical families. The heads of families belonging to Eleazar and Ithamar were alternately brought forward to draw, and the name of each individual, as called, registered by an attendant secretary. To accommodate the casting of the lots to the inequality of the number, there being sixteen fathers' houses of Eleazar, and only eight of Ithamar, it was arranged that every house of Ithamar should be followed by two of Eleazar, or, what is the same thing, that every two houses of Eleazar should be followed by one of Ithamar. If, then, we suppose a commencement to have been made by Eleazar, the order would be as follows: one and two, Eleazar; three, Ithamar; four and five, Eleazar; six, Ithamar; seven and eight, Eleazar; nine, Ithamar; and so forth [Bertheau]. The lot determined also the order of the priests' service. That of the Levites was afterwards distributed by the same arrangement (1Ch 24:31).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the rest of the sons of Levi were these,....

This last clause refers to the fact that the priestly service in all its parts was prescribed by Jahve in the law.<p>(Note: Of these twenty-four classes, each one had to perform the service during a week in order, and, as may be gathered with certainty from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-9.htm">2 Chronicles 23:9</a>, from Sabbath to Sabbath. Josephus bears witness to this division in Antt. vii. 14. 7: &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. Herzfeld, on the contrary (Geschichte des Volks Israel von der Zerstrung des ersten Tempels, Bd. i. S. 381ff.), following de Wette and Bramb., has declared the reference of this organization of the priests to David to be an invention of the chronicler, and maintains that the twenty-four classes of priests were formed only after the exile, from the twenty-two families of priests who returned out of exile with Zerubbabel. But this baseless hypothesis is sufficiently refuted by the evidence adduced by Movers, die bibl. Chron. S. 279ff., for the historical character of the arrangements attributed to David, and described in our chapters; but the remarks of Oehler in Herzog's Realenc. xii. S. 185f. may also be compared. An unimpeachable witness for the prae-exilic origin of the division of the priests into twenty-four orders is the vision of Ezekiel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16-18</a>), where the twenty-five men who worship the sun in the priests' court represent the twenty-four classes of priests, with the high priest at their head. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12-21</a> also unimpeachable evidence for the Davidic origin of the division of the priests into twenty-four classes is to be found, as we shall show in treating of these passages.) </body></html>
