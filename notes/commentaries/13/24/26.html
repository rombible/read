The lot was cast in a deliberate and solemn manner in presence of the king, the princes, the two high priests, and the chiefs of the priestly and Levitical families. The heads of families belonging to Eleazar and Ithamar were alternately brought forward to draw, and the name of each individual, as called, registered by an attendant secretary. To accommodate the casting of the lots to the inequality of the number, there being sixteen fathers' houses of Eleazar, and only eight of Ithamar, it was arranged that every house of Ithamar should be followed by two of Eleazar, or, what is the same thing, that every two houses of Eleazar should be followed by one of Ithamar. If, then, we suppose a commencement to have been made by Eleazar, the order would be as follows: one and two, Eleazar; three, Ithamar; four and five, Eleazar; six, Ithamar; seven and eight, Eleazar; nine, Ithamar; and so forth [Bertheau]. The lot determined also the order of the priests' service. That of the Levites was afterwards distributed by the same arrangement (1Ch 24:31).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Jaaziah; </span> the son either of Mahli; or rather, of Mushi last named; for Mahli’s posterity comes <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-28.htm" title="Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;">1 Chronicles 23:28</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the rest of the sons of Levi were these,....

For the oft-repeated <span class="cmt_word">Mahli</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Mushi</span>, they belonged to the time of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-19.htm">Exodus 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-33.htm">Numbers 3:33</a>). The elder of these, <span class="accented">Mahli</span>, as already seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-21.htm">1 Chronicles 23:21, 22</a>, had two sons, Eleazar and Kish, the sons of the latter of whom took the daughters of Eleazar, who had no sons, and thus kept only one house surviving, the head of which was (ver. 29) <span class="cmt_word">Jerahmeel</span>. This would seem to complete all that needs to be said of the Mahli line. Meantime, however, we are confronted by the contents of the latter half of our ver. 26 and ver. 27. These purport to give, amid some confusion of expression, sons of <span class="cmt_word">Merari by Jaaziah his son</span> (<span class="accented">Beno</span>). No anterior authority, however, can be found for this <span class="cmt_word">Jaaziah</span>. Neither of him nor of any of the three names (omitting <span class="accented">Beno</span>, which is evidently to be translated "his son") here linked on to his, is anything known. While we accept the text as it at present is, we have an additional branch with three families to add to the account of Merari - the branch of <span class="cmt_word">Jaaziah</span>, the three families of <span class="cmt_word">Shoham</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Zaeeur, Ibri</span>. Even so we have in ver. 27 to obliterate arbitrarily the conjunction <span class="accented">van</span>, prefixed to the name Shoham. Under these circumstances, Keil impatiently rejects these clauses altogether, as an interpolation, though one of which he can give no account, and adds up, in consequence, the families of Levi (exclusive of the priests) to twenty-two instead of the unexplained twenty-five of the present text. On the other hand, Bertheau retains the present reading, and accepts Jaaziah as a third branch of the family of Merari. If this were so, it is surprising that nowhere else is room found for the slightest mention of Jaaziah, nor any other mention of these supposed descendants. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The classes of the Levites. - The superscription, "As to the other Levites" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20</a>), when compared with the subscription, "And they also cast lots, like to their brethren the sons of Aaron" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>), leads us to expect a catalogue of these classes of Levites, which performed the service in the house of God at the hand of, i.e., as assistants to, the priests. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are the Levites still remaining after the enumeration of the priests. We might certainly regard the expression as including all the Levites except the Aaronites (or priests); but the statement of the subscription that they cast lots like the sons of Aaron, and the circumstance that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25</a> the twenty-four orders of singers and musicians, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-19</a> the class of the doorkeepers, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20-32</a> the overseers of the treasures, and the scribes and judges, are specially enumerated, prove that our passage treats only of the classes of the Levites who were employed about the worship. Bertheau has overlooked these circumstances, and, misled by false ideas as to the catalogue in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6-23</a>, has moreover drawn the false conclusion that the catalogue in our verses is imperfect, from the circumstance that a part of the names of the fathers'-houses named in 23:6-23 recur here in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-20.htm">1 Chronicles 23:20-29</a>, and that we find a considerable number of the names which are contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6-23</a> to be omitted from them. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-20.htm">1 Chronicles 23:20-25</a>, for example, we find only names of Kohathithes, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-26.htm">1 Chronicles 23:26-29</a> of Merarites, and no Gershonites. But it by no means follows from that, that the classes of the Gershonites have been dropped out, or even omitted by the author of the Chronicle as an unnecessary repetition. This conclusion would only be warrantable if it were otherwise demonstrated, or demonstrable, that the Levites who were at the hand of the priests in carrying on the worship had been taken from all the three Levite families, and that consequently Gershonites also must have been included. But no such thing can be proved. Several fathers'-houses of the Gershonites were, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20</a>., entrusted with the oversight of the treasures of the sanctuary. We have indeed no further accounts as to the employment of the other Gershonites; but the statements about the management of the treasures, and the scribes and judges, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20-32</a>, are everywhere imperfect. David had appointed 6000 men to be scribes and judges: those mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29-32</a> amounted to only 1700 and 2700, consequently only 4400 persons in all; so that it is quite possible the remaining 1600 were taken from among the Gershonites. Thus, therefore, from the fact that the Gershonites are omitted from our section, we cannot conclude that our catalogue is mutilated. In it all the chief branches of the Kohathites are named, viz., the two lines descended from Moses' sons (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-21.htm">1 Chronicles 24:21</a>); then the Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-23.htm">1 Chronicles 24:23-25</a>), and the main branches of the Merarites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26-30</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20</a> is to be taken thus: Of the sons of Amram, i.e., of the Kohathite Amram, from whom Moses descended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a>), that is, of the chief Shubael, descended from Moses' son Gershon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-16.htm">1 Chronicles 23:16</a>), his son Jehdeiah, who as head and representative of the class made up of his sons, and perhaps also of his brothers, is alone mentioned.</body></html>
