In the mystical body of Christ, every member has its use, for the good of the whole. Christ is High Priest over the house of God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection. In Christ, no difference is made between bond and free, elder and younger. The younger brethren, if faithful and sincere, shall be no less acceptable to Christ than the fathers.

The lot was cast in a deliberate and solemn manner in presence of the king, the princes, the two high priests, and the chiefs of the priestly and Levitical families. The heads of families belonging to Eleazar and Ithamar were alternately brought forward to draw, and the name of each individual, as called, registered by an attendant secretary. To accommodate the casting of the lots to the inequality of the number, there being sixteen fathers' houses of Eleazar, and only eight of Ithamar, it was arranged that every house of Ithamar should be followed by two of Eleazar, or, what is the same thing, that every two houses of Eleazar should be followed by one of Ithamar. If, then, we suppose a commencement to have been made by Eleazar, the order would be as follows: one and two, Eleazar; three, Ithamar; four and five, Eleazar; six, Ithamar; seven and eight, Eleazar; nine, Ithamar; and so forth [Bertheau]. The lot determined also the order of the priests' service. That of the Levites was afterwards distributed by the same arrangement (1Ch 24:31).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib,....

This accords with the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-6.htm">Nehemiah 12:6, 7</a>, and again in 19, 21, two families of the name Jedaiah are given in the priest-lists. We may, therefore, conclude that families descended from the Jeshuah of our present verse were among those who returned from captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-39.htm">Nehemiah 7:39</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shecaniah</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-3.htm">Nehemiah 12:3</a>, where spelt <span class="accented">Shechaniah</span>).

"For holy princes and princes of God were of the sons of Eleazar, and among the sons of Ithamar;" i.e., of both lines of priests holy princes had come, men who had held the highest priestly dignity. The high-priesthood, as is well known, went over entirely to Eleazar and his descendants, but had been held for a considerable period in the time of the judges by the descendants of Ithamar; see above, pp. 444f. In the settlement of the classes of priests for the service, therefore, neither of the lines was to have an advantage, but the order was to be determined by lot for both. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>,  equals  &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;,    <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>, are the high priests and the heads of the priestly families, the highest officers among the priests, but can hardly be the same as the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; of the gospel history; for the view that these &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; were the heads of the twenty-four classes of priests cannot be made good: cf.
