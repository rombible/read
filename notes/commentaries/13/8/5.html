We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance. The memory of the just is blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The reason of this return to the genealogy of the Benjamites seems to be the desire to connect the genealogical introduction with the historical body of the work. As the history is to begin with Saul, the genealogical portion is made to end with an account of the family of this Benjamite monarch. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 8<p>1Ch 8:1-32. Sons and Chief Men of Benjamin.<p>1. Now Benjamin begat, &c.&#8212;This chapter contains some supplementary particulars in addition to what has been already said regarding the tribe of Benjamin (see on [360]1Ch 7:6). The names of many of the persons mentioned are different from those given by Moses&#8212;a diversity which may be accounted for in part on grounds formerly stated, namely, either that the persons had more than one name, or that the word "sons" is used in a loose sense for grandsons or descendants. But there are other circumstances to be taken into account in considering the details of this chapter; namely, first, that the genealogies of the Benjamites were disordered or destroyed by the almost total extermination of this tribe (Jud 20:11-48); secondly, that a great number of Benjamites, born in Assyria, are mentioned here, who returned from the long captivity in Babylon, and established themselves&#8212;some in Jerusalem, others in different parts of Judea. There were more returned from Babylon of the families belonging to this tribe than to any other except Judah; and hence many strange names are here introduced; some of which will be found in the list of the restored exiles (compare Ezr 2:1-70).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah, and Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.

Some take the three last to be the sons of Ehud, spoken of in the next verse; but Shephuphan and Huram seem to be the same with Shupham and Hupham, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-39.htm">Numbers 26:39</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">Shephuphan and Huram</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-12.htm" title="Shuppim also, and Huppim, the children of Ir, and Hushim, the sons of Aher.">1 Chronicles 7:12</a>, note.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Descendants of Helem-in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-35.htm">1 Chronicles 7:35</a> sons, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-36.htm">1 Chronicles 7:36-38</a> grandsons.<p>As Helem is called &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, "his brother" (i.e., the brother of the Shemer mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-34.htm">1 Chronicles 7:34</a>), &#1492;&#1500;&#1501; would seem to be the third son of Heber, who is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32</a> &#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-39.htm">1 Chronicles 7:39</a> there follow three names, those of the sons of Ulla; on which Bertheau rightly remarks, the whole character of our enumeration would lead us to conjecture that &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; had already occurred among the preceding names, although we find neither this name nor any similar one, with which it might be identified, in the preceding list.</body></html>
