We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab&#8212;He had probably been driven to take refuge in that foreign land on the same calamitous occasion that forced Elimelech to emigrate thither (Ru 1:1). But, destitute of natural affection, he forsook or divorced his two wives, and in the land of his sojourn married a third, by whom he had several sons. But there is another explanation given of the conduct of this Benjamite polygamist. His children by Hushim are mentioned (1Ch 8:11), while his other wife is unnoticed. Hence it has been thought probable that it is Baara who is mentioned under the name of Hodesh, so called because her husband, after long desertion, returned and cohabited with her as before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-33.htm" title="The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and five.">Ezra 2:33</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-37.htm" title="The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one.">Nehemiah 7:37</a> 11:35</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shamed,....
