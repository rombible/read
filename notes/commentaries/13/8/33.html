And the king said, I will give them.">2Samuel 21:6</a>, we learn that Gibeah, or “Gibeah of Saul,” was the seat of the king. It is gratuitous to suppose that the chronicler has confounded two different places.<p><span class= "bld">And Ner begat Kish.</span>—<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm" title="Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.">1Samuel 9:1</a> gives the following pedigree of Kish: Kish son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bechorath, son of Aphiah; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-51.htm" title="And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.">1Samuel 14:51</a> states that Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, were sons of Abiel. The omission of intermediate names is not uncommon in these lists. We may, therefore, suppose that some members of the genealogical series are here omitted between Ner and Kish. The father of Abner was, of course, only a namesake of the present <span class= "ital">Ner,</span> which is perhaps a clan, not an individual.<p><span class= "bld">Saul begat Jonathan.</span>—So <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-49.htm" title="Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:">1Samuel 14:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-2.htm" title="And the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.">1Samuel 31:2</a>; save that the former passage has Ishui for Abinadab. This seems to be a case of double naming. Others identify Ishui with Ishbosheth.<p><span class= "bld">Abinadab.</span>—Comp.

Esh-baal (“man of Baal”) is the true name. Ish-bosheth (“man of shame”) is a sort of euphemism, avoiding the very mention of an idol. So the Merib-baal (“Baal strives;” rather, perhaps, Meri-Baal, “man of Baal”) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-34.htm" title="And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal; and Meribbaal begat Micah.">1Chronicles 8:34</a> appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame.

And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold your servant!">2Samuel 9:6</a>, &c, as Mephibosheth, where probably the right reading is Meribbosheth.

We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

But the order of the names here:<p>(1) Jonathan;<p>(2) Malchi-shua; and<p>(3) Abinadab - suggests another explanation, namely, that Ishui, the second son, died young, and that Abinadab was really the fourth son.<p>Esh-baal - Previous to the introduction of the Phoenician Baal-worship into Israel by Ahab, the word "Baal" &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;  ba&#8219;al had no bad sense in Hebrew, but was simply an equivalent of the more ordinary &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l, "God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a> note). Hence, there is nothing strange in the use at this time of the names, "Esh-baal" ("man of God"), "Baal," "Beel-iada," "Merib-baal," etc. Later on such names became offensive to pious ears, and were changed for the better, or for the worse, "Beel-iada" becoming "El-iada" ("let God aid") - "Esh-baal," "Ish-bo-sheth" ("man of shame") - "Merib-baal," "Mephi-bosheth;" and the like. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 8:33-40.

Of these descendants of Elpaal, also, nothing further is known, and the same may be said of the nine sons of Shimhi, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-19.htm">1 Chronicles 8:19-21</a>; of the eleven sons of Shashak, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-22.htm">1 Chronicles 8:22-25</a>; and of the six sons of Jeroham, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-26.htm">1 Chronicles 8:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>, although some of these names are met with elsewhere singly. The concluding remark, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-28.htm">1 Chronicles 8:28</a>, "These are heads of fathers'-houses," refers, without doubt, to all the names from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-15.htm">1 Chronicles 8:15</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-14.htm">1 Chronicles 8:14</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>. "According to their generations - heads" is in apposition to the preceding, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-24.htm">1 Chronicles 9:24</a>, but the meaning of the apposition is doubtful. The word &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; can hardly be repeated merely for emphasis, as the old commentators understood it, in harmony with the Vulgate principes inquam, for why should this word be so emphasized? Bertheau thinks that "according to their births - heads" is to be taken to mean that those who are enumerated by name are not the heads living at the time of the preparation of this register, but the individual families, with the name of their progenitor after whom they were named in the genealogical lists. But how this meaning can be found in the words in question, I at least cannot understand. Can the individual families be called &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, "heads of fathers'-houses"? The families are the fathers'-houses themselves, i.e., they are made up of the groups of related households comprehended under the name fathers'-houses. These groups of related households have, it is true, each of them either head, but cannot possibly be themselves called heads. The meaning seems rather to be that the persons named in the family registers, or registers of births, are introduced as heads (of fathers'-houses); and the reason why this is remarked would seem to be, to prevent those who are enumerated as the sons of this or that man from being regarded simply as members of fathers'-houses. The further remark, "these dwelt in Jerusalem," is manifestly not to be taken to mean that the heads alone dwelt there, while the households that were subordinated to them lived elsewhere; for it signifies that they dwelt in Jerusalem with the households which composed their respective fathers'-houses. That the households dwelt there also is not stated, merely because the register contains only the names of the heads. </body></html>
