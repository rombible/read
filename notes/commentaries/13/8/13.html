The clans of Beriah and Shema, who were settled at Ajalon (<span class= "ital">Yalo</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> near Gibeon, appear to have expelled a Gittite population from Ajalon, and dwelt in their stead. At all events, there is evident allusion to some famous exploit, in which the two Benjamite houses were more fortunate than the Ephraimites Ezer and Elead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-21.htm" title="And Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead, whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because they came down to take away their cattle.">1Chronicles 7:21</a>). We must not identify this Benjamite Beriah with the Ephraimite Beriah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-23.htm" title="And when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bore a son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with his house.">1Chronicles 7:23</a>.

We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab&#8212;He had probably been driven to take refuge in that foreign land on the same calamitous occasion that forced Elimelech to emigrate thither (Ru 1:1). But, destitute of natural affection, he forsook or divorced his two wives, and in the land of his sojourn married a third, by whom he had several sons. But there is another explanation given of the conduct of this Benjamite polygamist. His children by Hushim are mentioned (1Ch 8:11), while his other wife is unnoticed. Hence it has been thought probable that it is Baara who is mentioned under the name of Hodesh, so called because her husband, after long desertion, returned and cohabited with her as before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Aijalon; </span> a place formerly belonging to the tribe of Dan, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-42.htm" title="And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,">Joshua 19:42</a></span>; but after the return from Babylon possessed by the Benjamites, because both Dan and the rest of the ten tribes were yet for the generality of them in captivity, and but few of them returned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who drove away the inhabitants of Gath; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
