We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

But the order of the names here:<p>(1) Jonathan;<p>(2) Malchi-shua; and<p>(3) Abinadab - suggests another explanation, namely, that Ishui, the second son, died young, and that Abinadab was really the fourth son.<p>Esh-baal - Previous to the introduction of the Phoenician Baal-worship into Israel by Ahab, the word "Baal" &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;  ba&#8219;al had no bad sense in Hebrew, but was simply an equivalent of the more ordinary &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l, "God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a> note). Hence, there is nothing strange in the use at this time of the names, "Esh-baal" ("man of God"), "Baal," "Beel-iada," "Merib-baal," etc. Later on such names became offensive to pious ears, and were changed for the better, or for the worse, "Beel-iada" becoming "El-iada" ("let God aid") - "Esh-baal," "Ish-bo-sheth" ("man of shame") - "Merib-baal," "Mephi-bosheth;" and the like. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36.

They dwelt mainly in Gibeon, but a branch of them were settled in Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-32.htm">1 Chronicles 8:32</a>.f. In Gibeon, now El Jib, two hours north-west from Jerusalem (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a>), dwelt the father of Gibeon, with his wife and his sons. The plural &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is used because there dwelt there, besides the father of Gibeon, also his wife and his sons. The father, i.e., the lord and possessor of Gibeon, was called, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a>, Jehiel (&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, Keth. &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;), and his wife Maachah, a not uncommon female name (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-48.htm">1 Chronicles 2:48</a>). The descent of Jehiel from Benjamin is not given. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a> eight names are given as those of his sons, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-36.htm">1 Chronicles 9:36</a>. ten are mentioned, the latter statement being correct; for a comparison of the two passages shows that in our verse two names have been dropped out, - Ner between Baal and Nadab, and Mikloth at the end, which must have originally stood in our register also, - for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-32.htm">1 Chronicles 8:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a> their descendants are mentioned. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-37.htm">1 Chronicles 9:37</a> &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;. These names are evidently those of actual sons of Jehiel who were progenitors of fathers'-houses (groups of related households), but in the case of only two is the race descended from these further noticed. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-32.htm">1 Chronicles 8:32</a> we have that of the youngest Mikloth, who begat Shimeah, called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-38.htm">1 Chronicles 9:38</a> Shimeam. These also (viz., Shimeah and his family) dwelt in Jerusalem &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, "before their brethren," i.e., over against them, and &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1506;&#1501;, "with their brethren." The brethren are the other Benjamites in the first clause, those dwelling outside of Jerusalem and inhabiting the neighbouring country as far as Gibeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a>); in the second, those dwelling in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-28.htm">1 Chronicles 8:28</a>). From this it is clear that of the descendants of Abi-Gibeon only that branch which was descended from Mikloth went to Jerusalem.</body></html>
