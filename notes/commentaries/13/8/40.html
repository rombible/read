If we may assume that no names have been omitted, we are concerned with the fourteenth generation from Jonathan, the friend of David. The era of David has been fixed at about 1055-1045 B.C. ; so that the great-grandsons of Ulam may have flourished about 635-625 B.C. (1055 <span class= "ital">minus</span> 420), in the reign of Josiah. The omission of names, however, is as possible and as likely in the present series as elsewhere; and it is obvious that one or two additional members would carry the list past the exile (B.C. 588). There are reasons for believing that the posterity of Ulam really represent a family of the period of the Return. Their number is favourable to the supposition.

This Meribbaal, who was lame in his feet (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), had a son Micha (&#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-12.htm">2 Samuel 9:12</a> written &#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1488;), of whom came a numerous race. He had four sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-35.htm">1 Chronicles 8:35</a>), and the family of the last-named of these (Ahaz) is traced down, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36-40</a>, through ten generations to the great-grandson of Eshek. First it is traced from Ahaz to Alemeth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36</a>); then through Zimri, brother of this latter, to Binea, by &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;; then further by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; (hisson) to Azel, of whom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-38.htm">1 Chronicles 8:38</a> six sons are enumerated; and finally, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-39.htm">1 Chronicles 8:39</a>, the sons of his brother Eshek are named, and the sons and grandsons of the first-born of this latter are then enumerated. The last two verses are wanting after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-44.htm">1 Chronicles 9:44</a>. The names in the two registers correspond, except at one point, where we cannot get rid of the discrepancy that for &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36</a>) there stands in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-42.htm">1 Chronicles 9:42</a> &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; both times, probably through an error of transcription, by which out of the shortened form &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; there arose &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1491; and &#1512; being interchanged. Besides this, instead of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1506; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-35.htm">1 Chronicles 8:35</a>, we have in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-41.htm">1 Chronicles 9:41</a>, according to the harder pronunciation of the gutturals, &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1506;; and for &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-37.htm">1 Chronicles 8:37</a>, we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-41.htm">1 Chronicles 9:41</a> the longer original form &#1512;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;. Now since Ahaz, whose posterity is traced down to the tenth generation, was descended from Jonathan in the third generation, and his grandfather Mephibosheth was a boy of five years of age at the death of Saul and Jonathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), the grandsons of Ulam, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>, will be the thirteenth generation of Jonathan's descendants. Now Jonathan fell along with Saul in the year 1055 b.c., and consequently this thirteenth generation of Jonathan's descendants lived probably about 700 b.c., i.e., about 100 years before the Babylonian exile; for, according to the analogy of the royal race of David, we cannot reckon more than twenty-five years on an average for each generation.<p>(Note: Bertheau holds a contrary opinion to that given in the text, and thinks that by the numerous sons and grandsons of Ulam the son of Eshek we are brought down to post-exilic times, seeing that if Saul lived about 1080 b.c., and thirty years are reckoned to each one of the thirteen generations (Eshek being a descendant of Saul in the thirteenth generation), Azel and Eshek must have lived about 690 b.c. But this estimate is too high, for we cannot reckon sixty years to Saul and Jonathan from 1080 onwards, since Jonathan fell along with Saul in 1055, and his son Meribbaal was then hardly five years old, and must consequently have been born in 1060. For the following generations, moreover, not more than twenty-five years on an average should be reckoned. That being the case, the children's children of Ulam's sons, who were the twelfth generation of Micha's descendants, may have lived from 760 b.c. onwards, and during this period, from 760 to 700, may have increased to the troop of blooming grandchildren of Ulam mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>. But even supposing that thirty years should be reckoned for each generation, the last-named generation of 150 grandsons and great-grandsons of Ulam would have lived in the period from 660 to 600, i.e., before the exile, or at least before the first great deportation of the people with Jehoiakim in the year 599 b.c.) </body></html>
