Further, there is enough likeness between the name Aharah here and Ahiram there to warrant our assumption of their original identity. But we cannot hence conclude that the Nohah and Rapha of our list answer to the Shephupham-Shupham and Hupham of the other. It is more likely that Nohah and Rapha represent different clans, which were prominent at the time when the present list was draughted. <span class= "ital">Rapha</span> reminds us of the valley of Rephaim, south-west of Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-15.htm" title="Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.">1Chronicles 11:15</a>.<p>(3-5) The sons of Bela here are <span class= "ital">nine,</span> like the sons of the suspected <span class= "ital">Becher,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-8.htm" title="And the sons of Becher; Zemira, and Joash, and Eliezer, and Elioenai, and Omri, and Jerimoth, and Abiah, and Anathoth, and Alameth.

We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

Sons and Chief Men of Benjamin.<p>1. Now Benjamin begat, &c.&#8212;This chapter contains some supplementary particulars in addition to what has been already said regarding the tribe of Benjamin (see on [360]1Ch 7:6). The names of many of the persons mentioned are different from those given by Moses&#8212;a diversity which may be accounted for in part on grounds formerly stated, namely, either that the persons had more than one name, or that the word "sons" is used in a loose sense for grandsons or descendants. But there are other circumstances to be taken into account in considering the details of this chapter; namely, first, that the genealogies of the Benjamites were disordered or destroyed by the almost total extermination of this tribe (Jud 20:11-48); secondly, that a great number of Benjamites, born in Assyria, are mentioned here, who returned from the long captivity in Babylon, and established themselves&#8212;some in Jerusalem, others in different parts of Judea. There were more returned from Babylon of the families belonging to this tribe than to any other except Judah; and hence many strange names are here introduced; some of which will be found in the list of the restored exiles (compare Ezr 2:1-70).The sons and chief men of Benjamin, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/8-1.htm" title="Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third,...">1 Chronicles 8:1-32</a></span>.
