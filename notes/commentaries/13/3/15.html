Some, however, have taken the Jehoahaz of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a> for him. Next, that <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiakim</span> was not the original name of the next brother, but a name slightly altered by Pharaoh-Necho from Eliakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>). If the dates of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31, 34, 36</a>, be correct, there is no doubt that, though Jehoiakim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Eliakim, reigned after Jehoahaz, yet he was the elder, and is in his right place in the present passage. Next, that <span class="cmt_word">Shallum</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-11.htm">Jeremiah 20:11</a>) is another name of the Jehoa-haz of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30, 31, 34</a>, and several other places. It is possible that he finds the last place amid the four brothers of this verse because of his probable usurpation of the throne, in violation of the right of his elder brother, Jehoiakim, and the early fall he met with in consequence. Lastly, that the fourth brother, <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span>, whose name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>) was originally Mattha-niah, was put on the throne by the King of Babylon, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>) after that his nephew Jehoiachin (who could have no son old enough to succeed) was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12, 15, 17</a>) carried captive to Babylon. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In Jerusalem thirteen other sons were born to him, of whom four were the children of Bathsheba.

Besides these, David had also sons by concubines, whose names, however, are nowhere met with.
