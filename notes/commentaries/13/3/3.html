The expression “his wife” is added simply to balance the clause, to make up for the absence of details respecting her connexions, such as are given in the case of some of the other wives.

Eglah his wife&#8212;supposed to be another name of Michal, who, though she had no son after her mockery of David for dancing before the ark [2Sa 6:16, 20], might have had one previous to that time. She has the title of wife appended to her name because she was his proper wife; and the mention of her name last probably arose from the circumstance that, having been withdrawn from David and married to another husband but afterwards restored, she had in reality become the last of his wives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which title belongs either to all the foregoing women; or rather, as the singular number showeth, to Eglah only, last mentioned; who possibly may be so called, because she was his first, and therefore most proper, wife, though her son was born after all the rest before mentioned, and therefore both she and her son are put in the sixth place; the wives being here named only for the sons’ sakes.

These words, which are translated in the Vulgate, qui videbat dimidium requietionum, give, so interpreted, no fitting sense, but must contain proper names. The lxx have made from them three names, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x391;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;, on mere conjecture. Most commentators take &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; for the name of the man who, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-2.htm">1 Chronicles 4:2</a>, is called under the name Reaiah, &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;, the son of Shobal. This is doubtless correct; but we must not take &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; for another name of Reaiah, but, with Bertheau, must hold it to be a corruption of &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;, or a conjecture arising from a false interpretation of &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1510;&#1497; by a transcriber or reader, who did not take Hazi-Hammenuhoth for a proper name, but understood it appellatively, and attempted to bring some sense out of the words by changing &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492; into the participle &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;. The &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1495;&#1510;&#1497; &#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-54.htm">1 Chronicles 2:54</a> corresponds to our &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1510;&#1497;, as one half of a race or district corresponds to the other, for the connection between the substantive &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; and the adjective &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; cannot but be acknowledged. Now, although &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; signifies resting-place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43</a>), and the words "the half of the resting-place," or "of the resting-places," point in the first instance to a district, yet not only does the context require that Hazi-Hammenuhoth should signify a family sprung from Shobal, but it is demanded also by a comparison of our phrase with hmnchty chtsy in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-54.htm">1 Chronicles 2:54</a>, which unquestionably denotes a family. It does not, however, seem necessary to alter the &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; into &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;; for as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-54.htm">1 Chronicles 2:54</a> Bethlehem stands for the family in Bethlehem descended from Salma, so the district Hazi-Hammenuhoth may be used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-52.htm">1 Chronicles 2:52</a> to denote the family residing there. As to the geographical position of this district, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-54.htm">1 Chronicles 2:54</a>.</body></html>
