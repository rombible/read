Arphaia his son, Arnun his son, Ubia his son—viz., Ushaia’s; and his son, viz., Shechaniah’s Shemaiah,” &c. The difference between “sons” and “his son” in Hebrew writing is simply that between <span class= "ital">y</span> and <span class= "ital">w.</span> (See Note on 1 Chronicles 1)<p>This various reading presents a form of genealogy like that which prevails in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/3-10.htm" title="And Solomon's son was Rehoboam, Abia his son, Asa his son, Jehoshaphat his son,">1Chronicles 3:10-16</a>, and occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,">1Chronicles 3:17</a>, at the beginning of the present section. But it is probable that this reading is really an ancient correction of the Hebrew text, which, as it stands, appears to leave undefined the relation between Hananiah and the four families mentioned in this verse. The truth, however, would seem to be that the expression “the sons of Hananiah” includes not only Pelatiah and Jesaiah, but also the four families named after Rephaiah, Arnan, Obadiah, and Shechaniah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-42.htm" title="Now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were, Mesha his firstborn, which was the father of Ziph; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron.">1Chronicles 2:42</a>, and Note). The four founders of these families were perhaps brothers of Pelatiah and Jesaiah, though not necessarily so; for these families may have been subdivisions of those of Pelatiah and Jesaiah.<p><span class= "bld">Rephaiah.</span>—<span class= "ital">Iah healeth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm" title="Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD binds up the breach of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.">Isaiah 30:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm" title="And said, If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases on you, which I have brought on the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that heals you.">Exodus 15:26</a>).

As the family of David was the most considerable of any of the tribe of Judah, the genealogy of his descendants was preserved with great care and exactness; and is here recorded in part, to assist us in tracing the descent of our Lord Jesus Christ from him, that we might have that proof, among others, of his being the true Messiah. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-24 Genealogies. - Of all the families of Israel, none were so illustrious as the family of David: here we have a full account of it.

Malchiram also&#8212;As far as Jeconiah, everything is plain; but there is reason to suspect that the text in the subsequent verses has been dislocated and disarranged. The object of the sacred historian is to trace the royal line through Zerubbabel; yet, according to the present reading, the genealogical stem cannot be drawn from Jeconiah downwards. The following arrangement of the text is given as removing all difficulties [Davidson, Hermeneutics]:&#8212;1Ch 3:17. And the sons of Jeconiah the the captive, Salathiel (Shealtiel, Ezr 3:2; Ne 12:1; Hag 1:12, 14; 2:2) his son. 1Ch 3:18. And the sons of Salathiel; Zerubbabel and Shimei; and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister. 1Ch 3:19.

Here arises a difficulty, since elsewhere Zerubbabel is said to be the son of Shealtiel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> some think this is not the same Zerubbabel here as there; so Grotius (u); but I see no reason for that; but this difficulty may be removed by observing, that if Pedaiah was a son of Salathiel, as Kimchi thinks, then Zerubbabel, being his grandson, may be called his son, as grandsons are sometimes called sons in Scripture; or rather, Salathiel, having no children, adopted Zerubbabel, his brother's son, and made him successor in the government; so that he was the son of Pedaiah by birth, and of Salathiel by adoption; or else Salathiel dying without children, his brother Pedaiah, according to the law, married his widow, and by her had Zerubbabel, who was the proper son of Pedaiah, and the legal son of Salathiel: <p>and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam: who is called Abiud, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-13.htm">Matthew 1:13</a> another son of his, with their father, is mentioned in this verse, and five more in the next. From hence to the end of the chapter, the genealogy is carried on from the captivity of Babylon, out of which Zerubbabel came, to the coming of Christ; and if Ezra was the writer of this book, as is generally thought, who was contemporary with Zerubbabel, this account must be written by another hand: and it may be observed, that it is carried on in the same number of generations as in Matthew; and here it stands thus: <p>Zerubbabel, Hananiah, Jesaiah, Rephaiah, Arnan, Obadiah, Shecaniah, Shemaiah, Neariah, Elioenai, Anani; in Matthew thus, "Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob, Joseph"; the difference in names may be accounted for by their having two names; and it is remarkable that the Targum makes Anani to be the King Messiah, who was to be revealed; which, though it makes one generation less to his time, yet plainly shows that the Jews expected the Messiah to come at the end of this genealogy, and about the time Jesus the true Messiah did. Anani is reckoned by other Jews a name of the Messiah, who is said to come in the clouds of heaven, which "Anani" signifies; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. <p>(u) In Luc. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the sons of Hananiah; Pelatiah, and Jesaiah: the sons of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, the sons of Obadiah, the sons of Shechaniah.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">and Jesaiah … Shechaniah</span>] The LXX. reads (with some blunders hi reproducing the names), “and Jesaiah his son, Rephaiah his son, Arnan his son, Obadiah his son, Shechaniah his son,” thus adding five steps to the genealogy. The difference of reading in the Heb. text thus suggested is very slight. Probably the LXX. is to be followed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The Hebrew text, followed by the Vulgate, not followed by the Septuagint, reads here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>. Yet some manuscripts have the plural "sons," from which comes our Authorized Version. The indication is important. It is doubly interesting, as the only indication in our Hebrew text that tends to give confirmation to the very noteworthy differences of the Septuagint Version. For although this last, apparently somewhat perversely, begins its version with "sons," which plural does not so well suit its sequel, instead of the "son" of our Hebrew text, which would suit it, yet it proceeds with a translation which must have been obtained from another text, such text again suiting properly the <span class="accented">singular</span> - "son" <span class="accented">-</span> of our Hebrew. The form of its translation is analogous to that marked in the words of vers. 10-14. "The <span class="accented">sons</span> [sic <span class="accented">son</span>] of <span class="cmt_word">Ananiah, Pelatiah</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Jesaiah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Rephaiah</span> <span class="accented">his son</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Arnan</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Obadiah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Shechaniah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son," making six (presumably) consecutive generations. This, therefore, is the reading which (if correct) might carry down the genealogy to the times of Alexander the Great, and indeed to a time a quarter of a century later. And in doing so, it would certify this entry as of later date than probably any other of the canon! If we reject this position and reading, we have to get over the term, repeated several times, <span class="cmt_word">the sons of</span>. To do this, Bertheau <span class="accented">suggests</span> that the intention of our passage was, from the name Rephaiah inclusive, not to mention the individual four brothers' names, but to mention them as four distinguished families among the posterity of David - an attempt at explanation certainly not satisfactory. The conclusion of the matter <span class="accented">is</span>, that in this twenty-first verse we have difficulties in either alternative, not satisfactorily explained. Either we have the names in all of six brothers, being "<span class="accented">sons</span> of Hananiah" - the last four of whom are styled, not by their individual names, but as heads of families; or we have six lineal descendants from Hananiah. If this last supposition were correct, calculate a royal <span class="accented">succession</span> at the lowest average (say something under twenty years), and the genealogy, including what follows in the remaining verses of the chapter, will bring <span class="accented">us</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> above, to a date that covers the whole life of Alexander the Great. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The kings of the house of David from Solomon till the exile. - Until Josiah the individual kings are mentioned in their order, each with the addition &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, son of the preceding, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-10.htm">1 Chronicles 3:10-14</a>; the only omission being that of the usurper Athaliah, because she did not belong to the posterity of David. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> four sons of Josiah are mentioned, not "in order to allow of a halt in the long line of David's descendants after Josiah the great reformer" (Berth.), but because with Josiah the regular succession to the throne in the house of David ceased. For the younger son Jehoahaz, who was made king after his father's death by the people, was soon dethroned by Pharaoh-Necho, and led away captive to Egypt; and of the other sons Jehoiakim was set up by Pharaoh, and Zedekiah by Nebuchadnezzar, so that both were only vassals of heathen lords of the land, and the independent kingship of David came properly to an end with the death of Josiah. Johanan, the first-born of the sons of Josiah, is not to be identified with Jehoahaz, whom the people raised to the throne. For, in the first place, it appears from the statement as to the ages of Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-2.htm">2 Chronicles 36:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5</a>, that Jehoahaz was two years younger than Jehoiakim, and consequently was not the first-born. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a> it is expressly declared that Shallum, the fourth son of Josiah, was king of Judah instead of his father, and was led away into captivity, and never saw his native land again, as history narrates of Jehoahaz. From this it would appear that Shallum took, as king, the name Jehoahaz. Johanan, the first-born, is not met with again in history, either because he died early, or because nothing remarkable could be told of him. Jehoiakim was called Eliakim before he was raised to the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>). Zedekiah was at first Mattaniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Zedekiah, on his ascending the throne, was younger than Shallum, and that event occurred eleven years after the accession of Shallum  equals  Jehoahaz. Zedekiah was only twenty-one years old, while Jehoahaz had become king in his twenty-third year. But in our genealogy Zedekiah is introduced after Jehoiakim, and before Shallum, because, on the one hand, Jehoiakim and Zedekiah had occupied the throne for a longer period, each having been eleven years king; and on the other, Zedekiah and Shallum were sons of Hamutal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>), while Jehoiakim was the son of Zebudah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). According to age, they should have followed each other in this order - Johanan, Jehoiakim, Shallum, and Zedekiah; and in respect to their kingship, Shallum should have stood before Jehoiakim. But in both cases those born of the same mother, Hamutal, would have been separated. To avoid this, apparently, Shallum has been enumerated in the fourth place, along with his full brother Zedekiah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-6.htm">1 Chronicles 3:6</a> it is remarkable that a son of Jehoiakim's son Jeconiah is mentioned, named Zedekiah, while the sons of Jeconiah follow only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a>. Jeconiah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; shortened Coniah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>) is called, as kings, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>, Jehoiachin, another form of the name, but having the same signification, "Jahve founds or establishes." Zedekiah can only be a son of Jeconiah, for the &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; which is added constantly denotes that the person so called is the son of his predecessor. Many commentators, certainly, were of opinion that Zedekiah was the same person as the brother of Jehoiakim mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> under the name Zidkijahu, and who is here introduced as son of Jeconiah, because he was the successor of Jeconiah on the throne. For this view support was sought in a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-10.htm">1 Chronicles 3:10</a>., in which all Solomon's successors in the kingship are enumerated in order with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;. But all the kings who succeeded each other from Solomon to Josiah were also, without exception, sons of their predecessors; so that there &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; throughout denotes a proper son, while King Zedekiah, on the contrary, was not the son, but an uncle of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin). We must therefore hold &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; for a literal son of Jeconiah, and that so much the more, because the name &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; differs also from &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, as the name of the king is constantly written in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>. and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>. But mention is made of this Zedekiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a> apart from the other sons of Jeconiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a>), perhaps because he was not led away captive into exile with the others, but died in Judah before the breaking up of the kingdom. </body></html>
