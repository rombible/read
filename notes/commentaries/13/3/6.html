Elishama and Eliphelet&#8212;Two sons of the same name are twice mentioned (1Ch 3:8). They were the children of different mothers, and had probably some title or epithet appended by which the one was distinguished from the other.

The position of the town Jabez, which is mentioned only here, and which derived its name from a descendant of Judah, has not yet been discovered, but is to be sought somewhere in the neighbourhood of Zoreah. This may be inferred from the fact that of the six &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, two are always more closely connected with each other by &#1493; cop.: (1) Bethlehem and Netophathite, (2) Ataroth-beth-Joab and Hazi-Hammanahath, (3) the Zoreites and the families of the Sopherim inhabiting Jabez. These last were divided into three branches, &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., those descended from Tira, Shimea, and Suchah. The Vulgate has taken these words in an appellative sense of the occupations of these three classes, and translates canentes et resonantes et in tabernaculis commemorantes. But this interpretation is not made even probable by all that Bertheau has brought forward in support of it. Even if &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; might perhaps be connected with &#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, and interpreted "dwellers in tabernacles," yet no tenable reason can be found for translating &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; by canentes et resonantes. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492;, "that which is heard," cannot signify those who repeat in words and song that which has been heard; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; no more means canentes than it is connected (as Bertheau tries to show) with &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; htiw , "doorkeepers" (the Chaldee &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; being equivalent to the Hebrew &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;); and the addition, "These are the Kenites who came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab" (&#1502;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, to issue from any one, to be descended from any one), gives no proof of this, for the phrase itself is to us so very obscure. &#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are not inhabitants of the city Kain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-57.htm">Joshua 15:57</a>) in the tribal domain of Judah (Kimchi), but, judging from the succeeding relative sentence, were descendants of Keni the father-in-law of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), who had come with Israel to Canaan, and dwelt there among the Israelites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-24.htm">Judges 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>); and Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab, i.e., of the Rechabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6</a>), is probably the grandfather of Jonadab the son of Rechab, with whom Jehu entered into alliance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-23.htm">2 Kings 10:23</a>). But how can the families of Sopherim inhabiting Jabez, which are here enumerated, be called descendants of Salma, who is descended from Hur the son of Caleb, a man of Judah, if they were Kenites, who issued from or were descendant of the grandfather of the family of the Rechabites? From lack of information, this question cannot be answered with certainty. In general, however, we may explain the incorporation of the Kenites in the Judaean family of the Calebite Salma, on the supposition that one of these Kenites of the family of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses, married an heiress of the race of Caleb. On this account the children and descendants sprung of this marriage would be incorporated in the family of Caleb, although they were on their father's side Kenites, and where they followed the manner of life of their fathers, might continue to be regarded as such, and to bear the name. </body></html>
