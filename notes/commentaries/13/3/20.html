Malchiram also&#8212;As far as Jeconiah, everything is plain; but there is reason to suspect that the text in the subsequent verses has been dislocated and disarranged. The object of the sacred historian is to trace the royal line through Zerubbabel; yet, according to the present reading, the genealogical stem cannot be drawn from Jeconiah downwards. The following arrangement of the text is given as removing all difficulties [Davidson, Hermeneutics]:&#8212;1Ch 3:17. And the sons of Jeconiah the the captive, Salathiel (Shealtiel, Ezr 3:2; Ne 12:1; Hag 1:12, 14; 2:2) his son. 1Ch 3:18. And the sons of Salathiel; Zerubbabel and Shimei; and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister. 1Ch 3:19. And Hashubah, and Ohel, and Berechiah, and Hasadiah, Jushab-hezed. 1Ch 3:20. And Malchiram, and Rephaiah, and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah. 1Ch 3:21.

Here arises a difficulty, since elsewhere Zerubbabel is said to be the son of Shealtiel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> some think this is not the same Zerubbabel here as there; so Grotius (u); but I see no reason for that; but this difficulty may be removed by observing, that if Pedaiah was a son of Salathiel, as Kimchi thinks, then Zerubbabel, being his grandson, may be called his son, as grandsons are sometimes called sons in Scripture; or rather, Salathiel, having no children, adopted Zerubbabel, his brother's son, and made him successor in the government; so that he was the son of Pedaiah by birth, and of Salathiel by adoption; or else Salathiel dying without children, his brother Pedaiah, according to the law, married his widow, and by her had Zerubbabel, who was the proper son of Pedaiah, and the legal son of Salathiel: <p>and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam: who is called Abiud, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-13.htm">Matthew 1:13</a> another son of his, with their father, is mentioned in this verse, and five more in the next. From hence to the end of the chapter, the genealogy is carried on from the captivity of Babylon, out of which Zerubbabel came, to the coming of Christ; and if Ezra was the writer of this book, as is generally thought, who was contemporary with Zerubbabel, this account must be written by another hand: and it may be observed, that it is carried on in the same number of generations as in Matthew; and here it stands thus: <p>Zerubbabel, Hananiah, Jesaiah, Rephaiah, Arnan, Obadiah, Shecaniah, Shemaiah, Neariah, Elioenai, Anani; in Matthew thus, "Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob, Joseph"; the difference in names may be accounted for by their having two names; and it is remarkable that the Targum makes Anani to be the King Messiah, who was to be revealed; which, though it makes one generation less to his time, yet plainly shows that the Jews expected the Messiah to come at the end of this genealogy, and about the time Jesus the true Messiah did. Anani is reckoned by other Jews a name of the Messiah, who is said to come in the clouds of heaven, which "Anani" signifies; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. <p>(u) In Luc. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Hashubah, and Ohel, and Berechiah, and Hasadiah, Jushabhesed, five.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">and Hashubah</span>] Probably we should read “The sons of Meshullam: Hashubah.” See above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jushab-hesed</span>] The name means “Mercy is restored.” Many such significant names belong to the period of the Return.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The five additional names of this verse must presumably stand apart from the two sons and one daughter of the preceding verse, for some reason.

The meaning of some of the names, as especially of the last, <span class="cmt_word">Jushab-hesed</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Loving-kindness is returned," has led Bertheau and others to the conjecture that they may be separated as children born to Zerubbabel, one of the leaders of the return from captivity, after that return. This seems plausible, except for the consideration that, the more plausible it is, the more we might expect the explanation itself to have been notified. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The kings of the house of David from Solomon till the exile. - Until Josiah the individual kings are mentioned in their order, each with the addition &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, son of the preceding, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-10.htm">1 Chronicles 3:10-14</a>; the only omission being that of the usurper Athaliah, because she did not belong to the posterity of David. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> four sons of Josiah are mentioned, not "in order to allow of a halt in the long line of David's descendants after Josiah the great reformer" (Berth.), but because with Josiah the regular succession to the throne in the house of David ceased. For the younger son Jehoahaz, who was made king after his father's death by the people, was soon dethroned by Pharaoh-Necho, and led away captive to Egypt; and of the other sons Jehoiakim was set up by Pharaoh, and Zedekiah by Nebuchadnezzar, so that both were only vassals of heathen lords of the land, and the independent kingship of David came properly to an end with the death of Josiah. Johanan, the first-born of the sons of Josiah, is not to be identified with Jehoahaz, whom the people raised to the throne. For, in the first place, it appears from the statement as to the ages of Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-2.htm">2 Chronicles 36:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5</a>, that Jehoahaz was two years younger than Jehoiakim, and consequently was not the first-born. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a> it is expressly declared that Shallum, the fourth son of Josiah, was king of Judah instead of his father, and was led away into captivity, and never saw his native land again, as history narrates of Jehoahaz. From this it would appear that Shallum took, as king, the name Jehoahaz. Johanan, the first-born, is not met with again in history, either because he died early, or because nothing remarkable could be told of him. Jehoiakim was called Eliakim before he was raised to the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>). Zedekiah was at first Mattaniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Zedekiah, on his ascending the throne, was younger than Shallum, and that event occurred eleven years after the accession of Shallum  equals  Jehoahaz. Zedekiah was only twenty-one years old, while Jehoahaz had become king in his twenty-third year. But in our genealogy Zedekiah is introduced after Jehoiakim, and before Shallum, because, on the one hand, Jehoiakim and Zedekiah had occupied the throne for a longer period, each having been eleven years king; and on the other, Zedekiah and Shallum were sons of Hamutal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>), while Jehoiakim was the son of Zebudah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). According to age, they should have followed each other in this order - Johanan, Jehoiakim, Shallum, and Zedekiah; and in respect to their kingship, Shallum should have stood before Jehoiakim. But in both cases those born of the same mother, Hamutal, would have been separated. To avoid this, apparently, Shallum has been enumerated in the fourth place, along with his full brother Zedekiah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-6.htm">1 Chronicles 3:6</a> it is remarkable that a son of Jehoiakim's son Jeconiah is mentioned, named Zedekiah, while the sons of Jeconiah follow only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a>. Jeconiah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; shortened Coniah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>) is called, as kings, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>, Jehoiachin, another form of the name, but having the same signification, "Jahve founds or establishes." Zedekiah can only be a son of Jeconiah, for the &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; which is added constantly denotes that the person so called is the son of his predecessor. Many commentators, certainly, were of opinion that Zedekiah was the same person as the brother of Jehoiakim mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> under the name Zidkijahu, and who is here introduced as son of Jeconiah, because he was the successor of Jeconiah on the throne. For this view support was sought in a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-10.htm">1 Chronicles 3:10</a>., in which all Solomon's successors in the kingship are enumerated in order with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;. But all the kings who succeeded each other from Solomon to Josiah were also, without exception, sons of their predecessors; so that there &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; throughout denotes a proper son, while King Zedekiah, on the contrary, was not the son, but an uncle of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin). We must therefore hold &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; for a literal son of Jeconiah, and that so much the more, because the name &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; differs also from &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, as the name of the king is constantly written in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>. and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>. But mention is made of this Zedekiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a> apart from the other sons of Jeconiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a>), perhaps because he was not led away captive into exile with the others, but died in Judah before the breaking up of the kingdom. </body></html>
