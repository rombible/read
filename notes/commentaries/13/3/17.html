This section is peculiar to the chronicle.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">Assir.</span>—This word means prisoner, captive; literally, <span class= "ital">bondman.</span> It so occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm" title="To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-22.htm" title="And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.">Isaiah 24:22</a>. Accordingly the verse may be rendered, “And the sons of Jeconiah when captive—Shealtiel (was) his son.” This translation (1) accords with the Masoretic punctuation, which connects the term <span class= "ital">assir</span> with Jeconiah; and (2) accounts for the double reference to the offspring of Jeconiah, first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm" title="And the sons of Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son, Zedekiah his son.">1Chronicles 3:16</a>, “Zedekiah his son,” and then again here. Zedekiah is thus separated from the sons born to Jeconiah in captivity. The strongest apparent objection against such a rendering is that the expression “the sons of Jeconiah the captive” would require the definite article to be prefixed to the word <span class= "ital">assir.</span> No doubt it would; but then “the sons of Jeconiah the captive” is not what the chronicler intended to say.

The Davidic Line from Jeconiah to Zerubbabel<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A difficulty arises from the fact that whereas Zerubbabel is here represented apparently as the son of Pedaiah and consequently <span class="ital">nephew of Salathiel</span> (= <span class="ital">Shealtiel</span>), he is elsewhere called the <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of Shealtiel</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm" title="Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.">Ezra 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm" title="In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,">Haggai 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-2.htm" title="Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,">Haggai 2:2</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/3-27.htm" title="Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri,...">Luke 3:27-31</a>). The LXX. solves the difficulty by reading <span class="ital">Salathiel</span> (= <span class="ital">Shealtiel</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-19.htm" title="And the sons of Pedaiah were, Zerubbabel, and Shimei: and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister:">1 Chronicles 3:19</a>. It may be however that the names given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-18.htm" title="Malchiram also, and Pedaiah, and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah.">1 Chronicles 3:18</a> (including <span class="ital">Pedaiah</span>) are the names of the sons of Shealtiel. Another possible solution is that Zerubbabel was <span class="ital">grand</span>-son both to Shealtiel and Pedaiah, according to such a scheme as the following:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Pedaiah&emsp;&emsp;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;Shealtiel<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a daughter&emsp;&emsp;=&emsp;&emsp;a son<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;"&emsp;&emsp;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;Zerubbabel.&emsp;&emsp;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A minor difficulty arises from the fact that Salathiel (= Shealtiel) is here connected with David through Solomon, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/3-27.htm" title="Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri,...">Luke 3:27-31</a> his descent is traced through Solomon’s brother Nathan. However, intermarriage at some point in the genealogy between the two Davidic families would explain the difficulty.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-24.</span> - These verses contain a line of descent brought down to a point not merely posterior to the Exile, but possibly reaching to the time of Alexander. This line, however, through Solomon is lost so soon as the first name, that of Assir, is passed; Salathiel (Authorized Version)or Shealtiel, being descended from David, not through Solomon, but through Nathan, whole brother to Solomon. This Assir is not known from any parallel passage; and Luther, Starke, Bertheau, and others, followed by Zoekler (in Lange, 'Comm. O.T.') translate the name as <span class="accented">captive</span>, applying it to Jeconiah. Not all their reasons, however, <span class="accented">for</span> this, outweigh one which must be pronounced <span class="accented">against</span> it, viz. the absence of the article. The Septuagint and Vulgate versions agree with our own. The greater probability might be that Assir derived his name from being born after Jeconiah was in captivity, and such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>, may throw some light upon the extinction of Solomon's line here, and the transfer of the succession (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-11.htm">Numbers 27:11</a>, and see interesting note on the present place in 'Speaker's Commentary'). Salathiel is the Authorized Version incorrect rendering of the Hebrew Shealtiel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a> it is said, "And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>, "Salathiel, which was <span class="accented">the son</span> of Neri." Now, Neri was in the direct line of Nathan. There seems only one way of reconciling these statements - and the method removes similar difficulties in other places also - viz, to distinguish between the descent <span class="accented">natural</span> and the descent <span class="accented">royal</span>, and then acknowledge that the former was swallowed up, where necessary, of the latter. One as decisive instance of this kind as that before us is most useful to rule other cases. (For an important allusion to the house and family of Nathan's descendants, as well known at the time, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a> - a passage probably dating a few years previous to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.), <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The kings of the house of David from Solomon till the exile. - Until Josiah the individual kings are mentioned in their order, each with the addition &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, son of the preceding, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-10.htm">1 Chronicles 3:10-14</a>; the only omission being that of the usurper Athaliah, because she did not belong to the posterity of David. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> four sons of Josiah are mentioned, not "in order to allow of a halt in the long line of David's descendants after Josiah the great reformer" (Berth.), but because with Josiah the regular succession to the throne in the house of David ceased. For the younger son Jehoahaz, who was made king after his father's death by the people, was soon dethroned by Pharaoh-Necho, and led away captive to Egypt; and of the other sons Jehoiakim was set up by Pharaoh, and Zedekiah by Nebuchadnezzar, so that both were only vassals of heathen lords of the land, and the independent kingship of David came properly to an end with the death of Josiah. Johanan, the first-born of the sons of Josiah, is not to be identified with Jehoahaz, whom the people raised to the throne. For, in the first place, it appears from the statement as to the ages of Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-2.htm">2 Chronicles 36:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5</a>, that Jehoahaz was two years younger than Jehoiakim, and consequently was not the first-born. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a> it is expressly declared that Shallum, the fourth son of Josiah, was king of Judah instead of his father, and was led away into captivity, and never saw his native land again, as history narrates of Jehoahaz. From this it would appear that Shallum took, as king, the name Jehoahaz. Johanan, the first-born, is not met with again in history, either because he died early, or because nothing remarkable could be told of him. Jehoiakim was called Eliakim before he was raised to the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>). Zedekiah was at first Mattaniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Zedekiah, on his ascending the throne, was younger than Shallum, and that event occurred eleven years after the accession of Shallum  equals  Jehoahaz. Zedekiah was only twenty-one years old, while Jehoahaz had become king in his twenty-third year. But in our genealogy Zedekiah is introduced after Jehoiakim, and before Shallum, because, on the one hand, Jehoiakim and Zedekiah had occupied the throne for a longer period, each having been eleven years king; and on the other, Zedekiah and Shallum were sons of Hamutal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>), while Jehoiakim was the son of Zebudah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). According to age, they should have followed each other in this order - Johanan, Jehoiakim, Shallum, and Zedekiah; and in respect to their kingship, Shallum should have stood before Jehoiakim. But in both cases those born of the same mother, Hamutal, would have been separated. To avoid this, apparently, Shallum has been enumerated in the fourth place, along with his full brother Zedekiah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-6.htm">1 Chronicles 3:6</a> it is remarkable that a son of Jehoiakim's son Jeconiah is mentioned, named Zedekiah, while the sons of Jeconiah follow only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a>. Jeconiah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; shortened Coniah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>) is called, as kings, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>, Jehoiachin, another form of the name, but having the same signification, "Jahve founds or establishes." Zedekiah can only be a son of Jeconiah, for the &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; which is added constantly denotes that the person so called is the son of his predecessor. Many commentators, certainly, were of opinion that Zedekiah was the same person as the brother of Jehoiakim mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> under the name Zidkijahu, and who is here introduced as son of Jeconiah, because he was the successor of Jeconiah on the throne. For this view support was sought in a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-10.htm">1 Chronicles 3:10</a>., in which all Solomon's successors in the kingship are enumerated in order with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;. But all the kings who succeeded each other from Solomon to Josiah were also, without exception, sons of their predecessors; so that there &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; throughout denotes a proper son, while King Zedekiah, on the contrary, was not the son, but an uncle of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin). We must therefore hold &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; for a literal son of Jeconiah, and that so much the more, because the name &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; differs also from &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, as the name of the king is constantly written in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>. and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>. But mention is made of this Zedekiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a> apart from the other sons of Jeconiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a>), perhaps because he was not led away captive into exile with the others, but died in Judah before the breaking up of the kingdom. </body></html>
