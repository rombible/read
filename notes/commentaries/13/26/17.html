Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Toward Asuppim two and two - It is conjectured that the "store-house" in question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-15.htm">1 Chronicles 26:15</a> note) had two doors, to each of which two porters were appointed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-19.

These words, with forms akin to them, are often found in the Targums, but not elsewhere in the Scriptures. The nearest approach to the meaning of the word, as yet discovered, is a "suburb." The connection may just do as much as indicate that, whereas four porters kept the causeway gate, the Parbar gate was in closer proximity to the temple that was to be, but what this Parbar really was is not yet ascertained. Possibly it is the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of Josephus ('Ant.,' 15. 11:5).

Hosah's sons and brothers. &#1495;&#1493;&#1505;&#1492; has been already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>) along with Obed-edom as doorkeeper. Hosah made Shimri head of the Merarites, who served as doorkeepers, because there was no first-born, i.e., because his first-born son had died without leaving any descendant, so that none of the families descended from Hosah had the natural claim to the birthright. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen. Meshelemiah had eighteen (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-9.htm">1 Chronicles 26:9</a>), and Obed-edom sixty-two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-8.htm">1 Chronicles 26:8</a>); and all taken together they make ninety-three, whom we are (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">1 Chronicles 26:12</a>.) to regard as the heads of the 4000 doorkeepers. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a> the number of the doorkeepers appointed by David is stated to be 212, but that number most probably refers to a different time (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>). Bertheau further remarks: "According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>, sixty-eight are reckoned to Obed-edom and Hosah, in our passage seventy-five; and the small difference between the numbers is explained by the fact that in the first passage only the doorkeepers before the ark are referred to." Against this we have already shown, in our remarks on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>, that the number there mentioned cannot be held with certainty to refer to the doorkeepers. </body></html>
