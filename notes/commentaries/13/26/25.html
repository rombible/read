Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The divisions of the porters - The account of the porters here given makes them only twenty-four in number at any one time; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a> states that the duty was discharged by 4,000 persons.

Levites That Had Charge of the Treasures.<p>20. of the Levites, Ahijah&#8212;The heading of this section is altogether strange as it stands, for it looks as if the sacred historian were going to commence a new subject different from the preceding. Besides, "Ahijah, whose name occurs after" the Levites, is not mentioned in the previous lists. It is totally unknown and is introduced abruptly without further information; and lastly, Ahijah must have united in his own person those very offices of which the occupants are named in the verses that follow. The reading is incorrect. The Septuagint has this very suitable heading, "And their Levitical brethren over the treasures," &c. [Bertheau]. The names of those who had charge of the treasure chambers at their respective wards are given, with a general description of the precious things committed to their trust. Those treasures were immense, consisting of the accumulated spoils of Israelitish victories, as well as of voluntary contributions made by David and the representatives of the people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His brethren by Eliezer; </span> another son of Moses, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm" title="And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:">Exodus 18:4</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his brethren by Eliezer,....
