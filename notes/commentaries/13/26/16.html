It is almost certainly a mistaken repetition of the last two syllables of Asuppim, which immediately precedes it. (The mistake is as old as the Vulgate; the LXX. has <span class= "greekheb">εἰς δεύτερον</span><span class= "ital">,</span> perhaps reading <span class= "ital">lishnàyîm</span> instead of <span class= "ital">le Shuppîm.</span>) Read: <span class= "ital">And to Hosah</span> (the lot fell) <span class= "ital">to the west, with the gate Shallèketh on the highway that goeth up.</span><p><span class= "bld">The gate Shalleketh,</span> mentioned here only. The name means <span class= "ital">casting down</span> (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>, it denotes <span class= "ital">felling</span> a tree); and hence this gate has been identified with the “Rubbish” or “Refuse Gate.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-13.htm" title="The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall to the dung gate.">Nehemiah 3:13</a>.) It seems an objection to this, that the gate faced <span class= "ital">the highway that goeth up</span> from the lower city to the Temple. Perhaps the name alludes to the drop, or steep descent, from the Sanctuary to the city.<p><span class= "bld">Ward against ward.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">mishmār lĕ</span>‘<span class= "ital">ummath mishmār.</span> Compare the use of the same preposition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-12.htm" title="Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.">1Chronicles 26:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-8.htm" title="And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.">1Chronicles 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm" title="These likewise cast lots over against their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brothers.">1Chronicles 24:31</a>. Here the meaning seems to be that Hosah had to guard two posts, viz., the western gate of the Temple, and the gate Shalleketh which lay opposite, in the western wall of the Temple area. (The LXX. has φυλακὴ <span class= "greekheb">κατέναντι φυλακῆς</span>; the Vulgate <span class= "ital">custodia contra custodiam;</span> implying that Hosah’s warders were stationed opposite to each other.) But perhaps these concluding words refer to all four stations, and should be rendered, <span class= "ital">ward like ward,</span> or <span class= "ital">ward and ward alike,</span> or <span class= "ital">post over against post.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_chronicles/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.">1 Chronicles 26:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">With the gate Shallecheth — </span>A gate of the court, so called, as some think, because the ashes and filth of the temple were cast out on that side, which was the most convenient for that purpose, because that was a private quarter, the great ways to the temple lying on the other sides. <span class="ital">By the causeway of going up </span>— By which causey they went up toward the temple. <span class="ital">Ward against ward — </span>As one gate was over against another, the west against the east, and the north against the south, so one ward was over against another.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:1-32 The offices of the Levites. - The porters and treasurers of the temple, had occasion for strength and valour to oppose those who wrongly attempted to enter the sanctuary, and to guard the sacred treasures. Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All recent commentators seem to be agreed that the words "to Shuppim" ought to be cancelled, the name having arisen from an accidental repetition of the preceding word, "Asuppim."<p>The gate Shallecheth - literally, "the gate of projection" - the gate, i. e., through which were "thrown out" the sweepings of the temple, the ashes, the offal of the victims, and the like.<p>The causeway of the going up - Compare the marginal reference note.<p>Ward against ward - Or, "watch opposite to watch."

Hosah made Shimri head of the Merarites, who served as doorkeepers, because there was no first-born, i.e., because his first-born son had died without leaving any descendant, so that none of the families descended from Hosah had the natural claim to the birthright. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen. Meshelemiah had eighteen (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-9.htm">1 Chronicles 26:9</a>), and Obed-edom sixty-two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-8.htm">1 Chronicles 26:8</a>); and all taken together they make ninety-three, whom we are (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">1 Chronicles 26:12</a>.) to regard as the heads of the 4000 doorkeepers. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a> the number of the doorkeepers appointed by David is stated to be 212, but that number most probably refers to a different time (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>). Bertheau further remarks: "According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>, sixty-eight are reckoned to Obed-edom and Hosah, in our passage seventy-five; and the small difference between the numbers is explained by the fact that in the first passage only the doorkeepers before the ark are referred to." Against this we have already shown, in our remarks on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>, that the number there mentioned cannot be held with certainty to refer to the doorkeepers. </body></html>
