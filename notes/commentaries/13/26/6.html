Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Obed-edom and Hosah <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-10.htm">1 Chronicles 26:10</a> had been "porters," or door - keepers, from the time of the bringing up of the ark into Jerusalem <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. mighty men of valour&#8212;The circumstance of physical strength is prominently noticed in this chapter, as the office of the porters required them not only to act as sentinels of the sacred edifice and its precious furniture against attacks of plunderers or popular insurrection&#8212;to be, in fact, a military guard&#8212;but, after the temple was built, to open and shut the gates, which were extraordinarily large and ponderous.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That ruled throughout the house of their father; </span> that had the command of their brethren and families, being, as some say, captains of hundreds or of thousands; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-25.htm" title="And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.">Exodus 18:25</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-9.htm" title="And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.">2 Kings 11:9</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They were mighty men of valor:</span> this clause is divers times mentioned, because their office returned both strength and courage; for they were to shut the doors of the temple, one whereof was so great and weighty, that in the second temple it required the help of twenty men to open and shut it, as Josephus, an eye-witness, reports.

An erroneous translation for his <span class="accented">brethren</span>; a correction, however, rendering more patent the inconvenience of the unexplained absence of the conjunction, which seems to be called for before both "Elzabad," and "his brethren." Bertheau suggests that other names are wanting which should fill up the meaning of "his brethren." The brethren intended were probably Elihu and Semachiah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The order of succession was so determined by lot, that the four sons of Asaph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a>) received the first, third, fifth, and seventh places; the six sons of Jeduthun, the second, fourth, eighth, twelfth, and fourteenth; and finally, the four sons of Heman (first mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-4.htm">1 Chronicles 25:4</a>), the sixth, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth places; while the remaining places, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-15.htm">1 Chronicles 25:15-24</a>, fell to the other sons of Heman. From this we learn that the lots of the sons of the three chief musicians were not placed in separate urns, and one lot drawn from each alternately; but that, on the contrary, all the lots were placed in one urn, and in drawing the lots of Asaph and Jeduthun came out so, that after the fourteenth drawing only sons of Heman remained.<p>(Note: Bertheau, S. 218, draws quite another conclusion from the above-mentioned order in which the lots were drawn. He supposes "that two series, each of seven, were first included in the lot: to the one series belonged the four sons of Asaph and the three sons of Heman, Mattaniah, Uzziel or Azarel, and Shebuel or Shubael; to the other, the six sons of Jeduthun and Bukkiah the son of Heman. A lot was drawn from each series alternately, commencing with the first, so that the four sons of Asaph and the three sons of Heman obtained the places 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13; while to the six sons of Jeduthun, and the son of Heman added to them, fell the places 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. The still remaining ten sons of Heman were then finally drawn for, and received the placed from the 15th to the 24th." This very artificial hypothesis explains, indeed, the order of the lots, but we cannot think it probable, because (1) for the supposed dividing of the lots to be drawn into divisions of 10 and 14 no reason can be assigned; (2) by any such division the sons of Heman would have been placed at a disadvantage from the beginning as compared with the sons of Asaph and Jeduthun, since not only Asaph's four sons, but also all Jeduthun's six sons, would have been placed in the first rank, while only four sons of Heman accompany them, Heman's ten remaining sons having had the last place assigned them.)<p>As to the details in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-9.htm">1 Chronicles 25:9</a>, after Joseph we miss the statement, "he and his sons and his brothers, twelve;" which, with the exception of the &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, used only of the second lot, and omitted for the sake of brevity in all the other cases, is repeated with all the 23 numbers, and so can have been dropped here only by an error. The words &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; &#1500;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; are to be understood thus: The first lot drawn was for Asaph, viz., for his son Joseph. In the succeeding verses the names are enumerated, sometimes with and sometimes without &#1500;. Some of the names diverge somewhat in form.

Of the 24 names which are here enumerated, besides those of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, only Mattithiah recurs (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-21.htm">1 Chronicles 15:21</a>) in the description of the solemnities connected with the bringing in of the ark; "but we are not justified in seeking there the names of our twenty-four classes" (Berth.). </body></html>
