Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Obed-edom and Hosah <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-10.htm">1 Chronicles 26:10</a> had been "porters," or door - keepers, from the time of the bringing up of the ark into Jerusalem <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Obed-edom has been already mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a> as doorkeeper; see the commentary on the passage. From our passage we learn that Obed-edom belonged to the Kohathite family of the Korahites. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-19.htm">1 Chronicles 26:19</a>, the doorkeepers were Korahites and Merarites. The Merarites, however, are only treated of from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-10.htm">1 Chronicles 26:10</a> and onwards. &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4</a>) corresponds to &#1493;&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-2.htm">1 Chronicles 26:2</a>), and is consequently thereby brought under &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1</a>). Here, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-5.htm">1 Chronicles 26:5</a>, eight sons with whom God had blessed him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-6.htm">1 Chronicles 26:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-7.htm">1 Chronicles 26:7</a> his grandchildren, are enumerated. The verb &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; is used in the singular, with a subject following in the plural, as frequently (cf. Ew. 316, a). The grandchildren of Obed-edom by his first-born son Shemaiah are characterized as &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, the dominions, i.e., the lords (rulers) of the house of their fathers (&#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, the abstract dominion, for the concrete &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;; cf. Ew. 160, b), because they were &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, valiant heroes, and so qualified for the office of doorkeepers. In the enumeration in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-7.htm">1 Chronicles 26:7</a>, the omission of the &#1493; cop. with &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1494;&#1489;&#1491; is strange; probably we must supply &#1493; before both words, and take them thus: And Elzabad and his brethren, valiant men, (viz.) Elihu and Semachiah. For the conjecture that the names of the &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; are not given (Berth.) is not a very probable one. </body></html>
