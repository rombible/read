Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This verse is obscure, but its probable meaning is the following: "To these divisions of the porters, principal men, (were assigned) the watches, together with their brethren, for service in the house of the Lord;" i. e., the "chief men" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-11</a>, amounting to no more than 93, kept the watch and ward of the house, together with a further number of their brethren (4,000, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>), who assisted them from time to time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 26:13-19.

A special note is made of the care taken for the house of <span class="cmt_word">Asuppim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of "gatherings" or "stores." For all that we know of this "house," we seem to be left to the verses (15, 17) of this passage, and to the expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a>), "the storehouses, or stores of the gates" (though the Authorized Version, the "thresholds" of the gates), which would have been more intelligible had it been reversed, "the gates of the stores." Presumably it was a building for keeping safe certain of the sacred property, and was situated south of the temple, and, judging from ver. 17, had two doorways. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">seniorum concilium. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To Shuppim</span>. Nothing can be made of this word in this connection, as a proper name, though we have it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-12.htm">1 Chronicles 7:12, 15</a>) as such. It is now generally rejected, as probably due to the error of some transcriber, whose eye may have been caught again by the last two syllables of the closely preceding "Asuppim." But some would place it as the last word of the previous verse, and make it amplify the meaning of <span class="accented">Asuppim</span>, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "gatherings for stores." <span class="cmt_word">Shallecheth</span>. By derivation, this word means "sending or throwing down." Hence some call it, "the refuse gate." The situation of it is, however, defined here, as by the <span class="cmt_word">causeway of the going up</span>, and would seem to render such an interpretation less likely. According to Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), this causeway is still traceable: it runs up from the central valley of the town to the sacred site west of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a>); and Grove would identify the "gate of Shallecheth" with the present <span class="accented">Bab Silsileh.</span> The Septuagint translates <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gate of the temple-cell, which word they could get from the inverting of the order of the first two letters of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Shallecheth.</span> The Septuagint then mutts the following word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Ward against ward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. watch with watch.</span> The expression up- pears to refer to the fact that Hosah's lot threw to him the charge of a double position. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The whole number of doorkeepers of Obed-edom's family, his sons and brethren, was sixty-two; able men with strength for the service. The singular &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, after the preceding plural, is most simply explained by taking it to be in apposition to the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; at the beginning of the verse, by repeating &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; mentally before &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-9.htm">1 Chronicles 26:9</a> the number of Meshelemiah's sons and brothers is brought in in a supplementary way. </body></html>
