Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The divisions of the porters - The account of the porters here given makes them only twenty-four in number at any one time; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a> states that the duty was discharged by 4,000 persons.

Levites That Had Charge of the Treasures.<p>20. of the Levites, Ahijah&#8212;The heading of this section is altogether strange as it stands, for it looks as if the sacred historian were going to commence a new subject different from the preceding. Besides, "Ahijah, whose name occurs after" the Levites, is not mentioned in the previous lists. It is totally unknown and is introduced abruptly without further information; and lastly, Ahijah must have united in his own person those very offices of which the occupants are named in the verses that follow. The reading is incorrect. The Septuagint has this very suitable heading, "And their Levitical brethren over the treasures," &c. [Bertheau]. The names of those who had charge of the treasure chambers at their respective wards are given, with a general description of the precious things committed to their trust. Those treasures were immense, consisting of the accumulated spoils of Israelitish victories, as well as of voluntary contributions made by David and the representatives of the people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">As Shelomith and his brethren were over the treasures of the dedicated things</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-26.htm" title="Which Shelomith and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.">1 Chronicles 26:26</a></span>.

To Hosah fell the lot towards the west, by the door Shallecheth on the ascending highway. &#1492;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is the way which led from the lower city up to the more lofty temple site. Instead of the door on this highway, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a>, in the statement as to the distribution of the guard-stations, Parbar is named, and the highway distinguished from it, four doorkeepers being appointed for the &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, and two for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; .&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, probably identical with &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>, a word of uncertain meaning, was the name of an out-building on the western side, the back of the outer court of the temple by the door Shallecheth, which contained cells for the laying up of temple goods and furniture. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;, Bttcher translates, Proben, S. 347, "refuse-door;" see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>. Nothing more definite can be said of it, unless we hold, with Thenius on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>, that Ezekiel's temple is in all its details a copy of the Solomonic temple, and use it, in an unjustifiable way, as a source of information as to the prae-exilic temple. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-24.htm">Nehemiah 12:24</a>), guard with (over against?) guard, or one guard as the other (cf. on &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">1 Chronicles 26:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a>), Bertheau connects with Hosah, according to the Masoretic punctuation, and explains it thus: "Because it was Hosah's duty to set guards before the western gate of the temple, and also before the gate Shallecheth, which lay over against it." Clericus, on the contrary, refers the words to all the guard-stations: cum ad omnes januas essent custodiae, sibi ex adverso respondebant. This reference, according to which the words belong to what follows, and introduce the statement as to the number of guards at the individual posts which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-17.htm">1 Chronicles 26:17</a>., seems to deserve the preference. So much is certain in any case, that there is no ground in the text for distinguishing the gate Shallecheth from the western gate of the temple, for the two gates are not distinguished either in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a> or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a>.</body></html>
