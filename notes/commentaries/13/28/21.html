The representatives of religion would hardly be absent from an assembly of “all the princes of Israel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-1.htm" title="And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, to Jerusalem.">1Chronicles 28:1</a>) (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-5.htm" title="Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.">1Chronicles 24:5</a>, “princes of God.”) They might also be included among “the valiant men.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-13.htm" title="And their brothers, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and three score; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God.">1Chronicles 9:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">And with thee in every kind of work will be every volunteer with skill, for every kind of service:</span> that is to say, skilled craftsmen have volunteered for the work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-15.htm" title="Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.">1Chronicles 22:15</a>), and will support thy endeavours. The word rendered “volunteer” (<span class= "ital">nādîb</span>) strictly means one who offers free-will offerings. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-5.htm" title="Take you from among you an offering to the LORD: whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,">Exodus 35:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-22.htm" title="And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold to the LORD.">Exodus 35:22</a>; and the verb <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-1.htm" title="Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,">Judges 5:1</a>, <span class= "ital">hithnaddēb.</span>) The phrase “volunteer with wisdom,” or artistic skill, is not found elsewhere.<p><span class= "bld">Also the princes and all the people.</span>—Spoken, perhaps, with another gesture. The whole assembly would subserve the wishes of Solomon.<p><span class= "bld">Wholly at thy commandment.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">For all thy words: i.e.,</span> orders (Vulg., <span class= "ital">praecepta</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> or matters, business (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-32.htm" title="And his brothers, men of valor, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.">1Chronicles 26:32</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:11-21 The temple must be a sacred thing, and a type of Christ; it must be framed by Divine teaching. Christ is the true temple, the church is the gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framed according to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divine wisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. David gave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials were provided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions were given which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be not dismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first place. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried them through the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leave us, while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely to go on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope in God's mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chariot of the cherubims - The cherubim are themselves the chariot upon which Yahweh rides <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. behold, the courses of the priests and Levites&#8212;They were, most probably, represented in this assembly though they are not named.<p>also the princes and all the people&#8212;that is, as well the skilful, expert, and zealous artisan, as the workman who needs to be directed in all his labors.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And, behold, all the courses of the priests and the Levites,....

According to the usual supposition, the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is to be supplied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a> after &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;: "and gave him the weight for the golden candlesticks and their golden lamps," &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; being in a state of free subordination to the word &#1493;&#1504;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (J. H. Mich., Berth., and others). But apart from the fact that no analogous case can be found for such a subordination (for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>, which Berth. cites as such, there is no subordination, for there the first &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is the accusative of the material dependent upon &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;), the supplying of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; gives no suitable sense; for David here does not give Solomon the metal for the vessels, but, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>, only a &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, pattern or model for them. If &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; be supplied, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; must be "he appointed," and so have a different sense here from that which it has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>. This appears very questionable, and it is simpler to take &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500; without the article, as an accusative of nearer definition, and to connect the verse thus: "and (what he had in mind) as weight for the golden candlesticks and their lamps, in gold, according to the weight of each candlestick and its lamps, and for the silver candlesticks, in weight - &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1514;, according to the service of each candlestick" (as it corresponded to the service of each). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-16.htm">1 Chronicles 28:16</a> the enumeration is continued in very loose connection: "And as to the gold (&#1488;&#1514;, quoad; cf. Ew. 277, d) by weight (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;, acc. of free subordination) for the tables of the spreading out, i.e., of the shew-bread (&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;  equals  &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>); see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>), for each table, and silver for the silver tables." Silver tables, i.e., tables overlaid with silver-lamin, and silver candlesticks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-15.htm">1 Chronicles 28:15</a>), are not elsewhere expressly mentioned among the temple vessels, since the whole of the vessels are nowhere individually registered even in the description of the building of the temple. Yet, when the temple was repaired under Joash, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-14.htm">2 Kings 12:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-14.htm">2 Chronicles 24:14</a>, and when it was destroyed by the Chaldeans, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>, vessels of gold and silver are spoken of. The silver candlesticks were probably, as Kimchi has conjectured, intended for the priests engaged in the service, and the tables for reception of the sacrificial flesh after it had been prepared for burning upon the altar.</body></html>
