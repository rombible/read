Christ is the true temple, the church is the gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framed according to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divine wisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. David gave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials were provided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions were given which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be not dismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first place. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried them through the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leave us, while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely to go on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope in God's mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>.

Nor is this under any circumstances wonderful, but least of all considering their Divine origin. The Divine original of the tabernacle and all its belongings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>) was not to be a neglected precedent as regards the greater temple. It is said that "David gave" these "patterns to Solomon his son" (ver. 11), and the form in which he gave them is explained in ver. 19. There we read, "The whole in writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, he made me to understand - all the works of this pattern." Whatever we generally accept respecting the <span class="accented">writing</span> of the tables of the Law by the finger of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>), is at all events open for acceptance here. At the same time, the phraseology of our nineteenth verse is certainly not so uncompromising-as that of the references just instanced from the Books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The words of ver. 19 may be satisfied by the meaning that David was in such manner and degree "in the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>), that in the writing and the drawing of patterns his hand was entirely under the guidance of that Spirit. In either alternative, to hand over such documents and such "patterns" must have been felt by David and all present an act of which much should be made. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The <span class="cmt_word">patterns</span> of six parts of the future building are here delivered over to Solomon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="cmt_word">porch</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-7.htm">Ezekiel 40:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, where we read that the length was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred and twenty cubits; 2 Chronicles 8:12; 15:8; 29:7, 17); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> rang generally, but in this verse <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is all that appears.

What David here says (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3-7</a>) of the temple building, he had in substance already (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-7.htm">1 Chronicles 22:7-13</a>) said to his son Solomon: I, it was with my heart, i.e., I purposed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-7.htm">1 Chronicles 22:7</a>) to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jahve, and the footstool of the feet of our God, i.e., for the ark and for the capporeth upon it, which is called "footstool of the feet of our God," because God was enthroned above the cherubim upon the capporeth. "And I have prepared to build," i.e., prepared labour and materials, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2-4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-14.htm">1 Chronicles 22:14</a>.; on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-4.htm">1 Chronicles 28:4</a> David states how his election to be king was of God, who had chosen Judah to be ruler (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-2.htm">1 Chronicles 5:2</a>); and just so (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-6.htm">1 Chronicles 28:6</a>) had God chosen Solomon from among all his many sons to be heir to the throne, and committed to him the building of the temple; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-10.htm">1 Chronicles 22:10</a>. The expression, "throne of the kingdom of Jahve," and more briefly, "throne of Jahve" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>, or &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-14.htm">1 Chronicles 17:14</a>), denotes that Jahve is the true King of Israel, and had chosen Solomon as He had chosen David to be holder and administrator of His kingdom dominion. - On <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-6.htm">1 Chronicles 22:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-7.htm">1 Chronicles 22:7</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-10.htm">1 Chronicles 22:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-11.htm">1 Chronicles 17:11</a>.; and with the condition &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; &#1488;&#1501;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4</a>, where God imposes an exactly similar condition on Solomon. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, as is done at this time; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-61.htm">1 Kings 8:61</a>, and the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>. On this speech J. H. Mich. well remarks: "tota haec narratio aptata est ad prospositum Davidis: vult enim Salomoni auctoritatem apud principes et fratres conciliare, ostendendo, non humana, sed divina voluntate electum esse," To this David adds an exhortation to the whole assembly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-8.htm">1 Chronicles 28:8</a>), and to his son Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>), to hold fast their faithfulness to God.</body></html>
