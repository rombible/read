Reader, observe, this advice and charge, given by David to his son Solomon, is given by the Holy Ghost to thee, and every human creature into whose hands these divine oracles come. O! see that thou attend to it, and make it thy chief care, and the constant business of thy life, to comply with and reduce it to practice.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 During David's last sickness, many chief priests and Levites were at Jerusalem. Finding himself able, David spoke of his purpose to build a temple for God, and of God's disallowing that purpose. He opened to them God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon. David charged them to cleave stedfastly to God and their duty. We cannot do our work as we should, unless we put on resolution, and fetch in strength from Divine grace. Religion or piety has two distinct parts. The first is knowledge of God, the second is worship of God. David says, Know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. God is made known by his works and word. Revelation alone shows the whole character of God, in his providence, his holy law, his condemnation of sinners, his blessed gospel, and the ministration of the Spirit to all true believers. The natural man cannot receive this knowledge of God. But thus we learn the value of the Saviour's atonement, and of the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and are influenced to walk in all his commandments. It brings a sinner to his proper place at the foot of the cross, as a poor, guilty, helpless worm, deserving wrath, yet expecting every thing needful from the free mercy and grace of God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Having been forgiven much, the pardoned sinner learns to love much.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Know thou the God of thy father - "Knowing God," in the sense of having a religious trust in Him, is an unusual phrase in the earlier Scriptures.

The expression, "throne of the kingdom of Jahve," and more briefly, "throne of Jahve" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>, or &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-14.htm">1 Chronicles 17:14</a>), denotes that Jahve is the true King of Israel, and had chosen Solomon as He had chosen David to be holder and administrator of His kingdom dominion. - On <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-6.htm">1 Chronicles 22:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-7.htm">1 Chronicles 22:7</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-10.htm">1 Chronicles 22:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-11.htm">1 Chronicles 17:11</a>.; and with the condition &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; &#1488;&#1501;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4</a>, where God imposes an exactly similar condition on Solomon. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, as is done at this time; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-61.htm">1 Kings 8:61</a>, and the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>. On this speech J. H. Mich. well remarks: "tota haec narratio aptata est ad prospositum Davidis: vult enim Salomoni auctoritatem apud principes et fratres conciliare, ostendendo, non humana, sed divina voluntate electum esse," To this David adds an exhortation to the whole assembly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-8.htm">1 Chronicles 28:8</a>), and to his son Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>), to hold fast their faithfulness to God.</body></html>
