Finding himself able, David spoke of his purpose to build a temple for God, and of God's disallowing that purpose. He opened to them God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon. David charged them to cleave stedfastly to God and their duty. We cannot do our work as we should, unless we put on resolution, and fetch in strength from Divine grace. Religion or piety has two distinct parts. The first is knowledge of God, the second is worship of God. David says, Know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. God is made known by his works and word. Revelation alone shows the whole character of God, in his providence, his holy law, his condemnation of sinners, his blessed gospel, and the ministration of the Spirit to all true believers. The natural man cannot receive this knowledge of God. But thus we learn the value of the Saviour's atonement, and of the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and are influenced to walk in all his commandments. It brings a sinner to his proper place at the foot of the cross, as a poor, guilty, helpless worm, deserving wrath, yet expecting every thing needful from the free mercy and grace of God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Having been forgiven much, the pardoned sinner learns to love much.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Besides the message sent to David through Nathan, he had a revelation, of which we have only the indirect account given here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8-10</a> (see the note). He was told that one of his sons should be raised up to fill his throne after him, and should build the temple.

Like that of Christ, of whom he was a type, the appointment of Solomon to the kingdom above all his brethren was frequently pre-intimated (1Ch 17:12; 22:9; 2Sa 7:12-14; 12:24, 25; 1Ki 1:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto me, Solomon that son, he shall build my house,....

As Benaiah the son of Jehoiada is elsewhere, when named among the public officials of David, called chief of the royal body-guard (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>), Bertheau does not scruple to transpose the names here. But the hypothesis of such a transposition is neither necessary nor probable in the case of a name which, like Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, so frequently occurs (e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>). Since sons not unfrequently received the name of the grandfather, Jehoiada the son of the hero Benaiah may have been named after his grandfather Jehoiada. Abiathar is without doubt the high priest of this name of Ithamar's family) <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>, etc.; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1-4</a>), and is here mentioned as being also a friend and adviser of David.
