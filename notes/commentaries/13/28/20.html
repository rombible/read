Christ is the true temple, the church is the gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framed according to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divine wisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. David gave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials were provided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions were given which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be not dismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first place. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried them through the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leave us, while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely to go on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope in God's mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chariot of the cherubims - The cherubim are themselves the chariot upon which Yahweh rides <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

According to the usual supposition, the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is to be supplied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a> after &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;: "and gave him the weight for the golden candlesticks and their golden lamps," &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; being in a state of free subordination to the word &#1493;&#1504;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (J. H. Mich., Berth., and others). But apart from the fact that no analogous case can be found for such a subordination (for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>, which Berth. cites as such, there is no subordination, for there the first &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is the accusative of the material dependent upon &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;), the supplying of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; gives no suitable sense; for David here does not give Solomon the metal for the vessels, but, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>, only a &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, pattern or model for them. If &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; be supplied, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; must be "he appointed," and so have a different sense here from that which it has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>. This appears very questionable, and it is simpler to take &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500; without the article, as an accusative of nearer definition, and to connect the verse thus: "and (what he had in mind) as weight for the golden candlesticks and their lamps, in gold, according to the weight of each candlestick and its lamps, and for the silver candlesticks, in weight - &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1514;, according to the service of each candlestick" (as it corresponded to the service of each). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-16.htm">1 Chronicles 28:16</a> the enumeration is continued in very loose connection: "And as to the gold (&#1488;&#1514;, quoad; cf. Ew. 277, d) by weight (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;, acc. of free subordination) for the tables of the spreading out, i.e., of the shew-bread (&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;  equals  &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>); see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>), for each table, and silver for the silver tables." Silver tables, i.e., tables overlaid with silver-lamin, and silver candlesticks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-15.htm">1 Chronicles 28:15</a>), are not elsewhere expressly mentioned among the temple vessels, since the whole of the vessels are nowhere individually registered even in the description of the building of the temple. Yet, when the temple was repaired under Joash, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-14.htm">2 Kings 12:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-14.htm">2 Chronicles 24:14</a>, and when it was destroyed by the Chaldeans, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>, vessels of gold and silver are spoken of. The silver candlesticks were probably, as Kimchi has conjectured, intended for the priests engaged in the service, and the tables for reception of the sacrificial flesh after it had been prepared for burning upon the altar.</body></html>
