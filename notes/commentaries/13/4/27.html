The most remarkable person in this chapter is Jabez. We are not told upon what account Jabez was more honourable than his brethren; but we find that he was a praying man. The way to be truly great, is to seek to do God's will, and to pray earnestly. Here is the prayer he made. Jabez prayed to the living and true God, who alone can hear and answer prayer; and, in prayer he regarded him as a God in covenant with his people. He does not express his promise, but leaves it to be understood; he was afraid to promise in his own strength, and resolved to devote himself entirely to God. Lord, if thou wilt bless me and keep me, do what thou wilt with me; I will be at thy command and disposal for ever. As the text reads it, this was the language of a most ardent and affectionate desire, Oh that thou wouldest bless me! Four things Jabez prayed for. 1. That God would bless him indeed. Spiritual blessings are the best blessings: God's blessings are real things, and produce real effects. 2. That He would enlarge his coast. That God would enlarge our hearts, and so enlarge our portion in himself, and in the heavenly Canaan, ought to be our desire and prayer. 3. That God's hand might be with him. God's hand with us, to lead us, protect us, strengthen us, and to work all our works in us and for us, is a hand all-sufficient for us. 4. That he would keep him from evil, the evil of sin, the evil of trouble, all the evil designs of his enemies, that they might not hurt, nor make him a Jabez indeed, a man of sorrow. God granted that which he requested. God is ever ready to hear prayer: his ear is not now heavy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Among plants and hedges - Rather, "in Netaim and Gederah" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>.<p>With the king - Or, probably, "on the king's property."

The conjunction is omitted, however, before &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as also before &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-3.htm">1 Chronicles 4:3</a>, to show that the descendants of Shelah form a second line of descendants of Judah, co-ordinate with the sons of Judah enumerated in vv. 1-19, concerning whom only a little obscure but not unimportant information has been preserved. Those mentioned as sons are Er (which also was the name of the first-born of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3</a>.), father of Lecah, and Laadan, the father of Mareshah. The latter name denotes, beyond question, a town which still exists as the ruin Marash in the Shephelah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a> (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>), and consequently Lecah (&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;) also is the name of a locality not elsewhere mentioned. The further descendants of Shelah were, "the families of the Byssus-work of the house of Ashbea," i.e., the families of Ashbea, a man of whom nothing further is known. Of these families some were connected with a famous weaving-house or linen (Byssus) manufactory, probably in Egypt; and then further, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-22.htm">1 Chronicles 4:22</a>, "Jokim, and the man of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, which ruled over Moab, and Jashubi-lehem." Kimchi conjectured that &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1492; was the place called &#1499;&#1494;&#1497;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5</a>  equals  &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>, in the low land, where Shelah was born. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; is a strange name, "which the punctuators would hardly have pronounced in the way they have done if it had not come down to them by tradition" (Berth.). The other names denote heads of families or branches of families, the branches and families being included in them.<p>(Note: Jerome has given a curious translation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-22.htm">1 Chronicles 4:22</a>, "et qui stare fecit solem, virique mendacii et securus et incendens, qui principes fuerunt in Moab et qui reversi sunt in Lahem: haec autem verba vetera," - according to the Jewish Midrash, in which &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; was connected with the narrative in the book of Ruth. For &#1497;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, qui stare fecit solem, is supposed to be Elimelech, and the viri mendacii Mahlon and Chilion, so well known from the book of Ruth, who went with their father into the land of Moab and married Moabitesses.)<p>Nothing is told us of them beyond what is found in our verses, according to which the four first named ruled over Moab during a period in the primeval time; fir, as the historian himself remarks, "these things are old." </body></html>
