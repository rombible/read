So the Vat., LXX. <span class= "greekheb">Ρηχάβ</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm" title="And the families of the scribes which dwelled at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites. These are the Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab.">1Chronicles 2:55</a>, where the Sopherim of Jabez are called Rechabites, and see Notes on the passage. These Rechabites united with the Salmaite branch of Hurites; and Hur was a son of Caleb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-19.htm" title="And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took to him Ephrath, which bore him Hur.">1Chronicles 2:19</a>. Hence it is likely that the Chelub of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-11.htm" title="And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir, which was the father of Eshton.">1Chronicles 4:11</a> is identical with the Caleb-Chelubai of 1 Chronicles 2, who represents a main division of the Hezronites. Others suppose that the epithet, “brother of Shuah” (Shuhah), is meant to obviate this identification. The other names in this short section are wholly unknown. But their form shows at once that Beth-rapha and Ir-nahash (serpent city) are towns.<p><span class= "bld">Paseah</span> (lame; comp. Latin Claudius as a family name) recurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-6.htm" title="Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.">Nehemiah 3:6</a>; and as the name of a clan of Nethinim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-49.htm" title="The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai,">Ezra 2:49</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-51.htm" title="The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Phaseah,">Nehemiah 7:51</a>. The subscription, “these are the men of Rechah” (Rechab), probably looks back as far as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-8.htm" title="And Coz begat Anub, and Zobebah, and the families of Aharhel the son of Harum.">1Chronicles 4:8</a>.<p>(13–15) <span class= "bld">The sons of Kenaz</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Kenizzite element in Judah. Kenaz was the name of an Edomite clan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-53.htm" title="Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,">1Chronicles 1:53</a>, and of an old Canaanite race.<p><span class= "bld">Othniel.</span>—<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm" title="And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.">Judges 1:13</a>, one of the heroes of the conquest; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>, he vanquishes Chushan-rishathaim, king of Aram-naharaim. In both passages he is called “son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.” The Kenizzites, who cast in their lot with the Calebites of Judah, were naturally called “younger brothers” of their new kindred.<p><span class= "bld">Seraiah</span> is unknown.<p><span class= "bld">The</span> <span class= "bld">sons of Othniel,</span> <span class= "bld">Hathath.</span>—Eathath means <span class= "ital">dread,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-21.htm" title="For now you are nothing; you see my casting down, and are afraid.">Job 6:21</a>. Comp. the name Hittites, from the same root. The sons of Othniel (lion of God) would be a terror to their foes.<p><span class= "bld">“And Meonothai”</span> has perhaps been accidentally omitted at the end of this verse, before the same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-14.htm" title="And Meonothai begat Ophrah: and Seraiah begat Joab, the father of the valley of Charashim; for they were craftsmen.">1Chronicles 4:14</a>. Or the genealogist may have purposely omitted it, as implied by what follows <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-14.htm" title="And Meonothai begat Ophrah: and Seraiah begat Joab, the father of the valley of Charashim; for they were craftsmen.">1Chronicles 4:14</a>. Meonothai is apparently a gentilic name, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Meonothites. The name Maon occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm" title="Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,">Joshua 15:55</a> as a Judcan town; and Maon was the residence of the Calebite Nabal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/25-2.htm" title="And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.">1Samuel 25:2-3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Ophrah.</span>—Occurs several times as the name of a town; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-7.htm" title="Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.">Jude 1:7</a> as the city of Gideon, who belonged to Manasseh; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm" title="And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,">Joshua 18:23</a>, as a place in Benjamin. The latter may be meant here, as the boundaries of the tribes varied at different epochs.<p><span class= "bld">Joab, father of the valley of Charashim.</span>—Charashim means workers in wood, or metal, or stone, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.">1Chronicles 14:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-12.htm" title="And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as worked iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-15.htm" title="Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.">1Chronicles 22:15</a>.

The most remarkable person in this chapter is Jabez. We are not told upon what account Jabez was more honourable than his brethren; but we find that he was a praying man. The way to be truly great, is to seek to do God's will, and to pray earnestly. Here is the prayer he made. Jabez prayed to the living and true God, who alone can hear and answer prayer; and, in prayer he regarded him as a God in covenant with his people. He does not express his promise, but leaves it to be understood; he was afraid to promise in his own strength, and resolved to devote himself entirely to God. Lord, if thou wilt bless me and keep me, do what thou wilt with me; I will be at thy command and disposal for ever. As the text reads it, this was the language of a most ardent and affectionate desire, Oh that thou wouldest bless me! Four things Jabez prayed for. 1. That God would bless him indeed. Spiritual blessings are the best blessings: God's blessings are real things, and produce real effects. 2. That He would enlarge his coast. That God would enlarge our hearts, and so enlarge our portion in himself, and in the heavenly Canaan, ought to be our desire and prayer. 3. That God's hand might be with him. God's hand with us, to lead us, protect us, strengthen us, and to work all our works in us and for us, is a hand all-sufficient for us. 4. That he would keep him from evil, the evil of sin, the evil of trouble, all the evil designs of his enemies, that they might not hurt, nor make him a Jabez indeed, a man of sorrow. God granted that which he requested. God is ever ready to hear prayer: his ear is not now heavy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It has been conjectured from the strangeness of all the names in this list, that we have here a fragment of Canaanite record, connected with the family of the "Shua," whose daughter Judah took to wife <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-2.htm">Genesis 38:2</a>, and whose family thus became related to the tribe of Judah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. God granted him that which he requested&#8212;Whatever was the kind of undertaking which roused his anxieties, Jabez enjoyed a remarkable degree of prosperity, and God, in this instance, proved that He was not only the hearer, but the answerer of prayer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir,.... If Shuah is the same with Hushah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>, then Chelub was the son of Ezer: <p>which was the father of Eshton; not the prince of a place called Eshton, as Vatablus; for it is the name of a man, the son of Mehir, and who in the next verse is said to beget sons. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir, which was the father of Eshton.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - Of the whole of the group of names, contained in these two verses, it must be said that we are in the dark. The suggestion of Grove, in his art. "Ir-enahash" (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), is worth notice, that possibly the versos may be a reminiscence of some Canaanitish graft on Judah - the Shuah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) of ver. 11 pointing to the Shua (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>)of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-2.htm">Genesis 38:2</a>. Beth-rapha (the house of the giant) looks more like the name of a place than of a person, though the text needs a person, and such may be covered possibly by this name, though it be of a place. Ir-nahash (the city of the serpent). Jerome, in his 'Quaestiones Hebraicae in Parah,' asserts or repeats the assertion of some one else that this is no other place than Bethlehem; taking Nahash as a synonym with Jesse. Unlikely as this is, no place of the name is known. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sons of Ashur, the father of Tekoa, who, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-24.htm">1 Chronicles 2:24</a>, was a posthumous son of Hezron. Ashur had two wives, Helah and Naarah. Of the latter came four sons and as many families: Ahuzam, of whom nothing further is known; Hepher, also unknown, but to be distinguished from the Gileadite of the same name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-36.htm">1 Chronicles 11:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-32.htm">Numbers 26:32</a>. The conjecture that the name is connected wit the land of Hepher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-10.htm">1 Kings 4:10</a>), the territory of a king conquered by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-17.htm">Joshua 12:17</a>) (Berth.), is not very well supported. Temani (man of the south) may be simply the name of a person, but it is probably, like the following, the name of a family. Haahashtari, descended from Ahashtar, is quite unknown. </body></html>
