Clearly, therefore, the sentence “And these are the sons of Bithiah, the daughter of Pharaoh, which Mered took”—a sentence which is meaningless in its present position—must be restored to its original place after the first statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-17.htm" title="And the sons of Ezra were, Jether, and Mered, and Epher, and Jalon: and she bore Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa.">1Chronicles 4:17</a>. We thus get the sense: “And the sons of Ezra were Jepher and Mered, and Epher and Jalon. And these [the following] are the sons of Bithiah, daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered took [to wife]; she conceived Miriam and Shammai and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa. And his [Mered’s] wife the Jewess bare Jered . . . Zanoah.” Thus the house of Mered son of Ezra bifurcates into a purely Judæan and a mixed Egyptian group of families. Eshtemoa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-17.htm" title="And the sons of Ezra were, Jether, and Mered, and Epher, and Jalon: and she bore Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa.">1Chronicles 4:17</a>) lay south of Hebron, in the hil-country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-50.htm" title="And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,">Joshua 15:50</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Gedor.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm" title="And Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah.

It may be a Hebraized form of Bent-Aah, daughter of the Moon, or some like native name. Daughter of Pharaoh, if the nomenclature be tribal, need only mean an Egyptian clan which amalgamated with that of Mered. On the other hand, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-11.htm" title="And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD has come.">2Chronicles 8:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm" title="But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.">1Kings 9:24</a>, where the phrase is used in its literal sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_chronicles/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-18.htm" title="And his wife Jehudijah bore Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Socho, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.

But it is not likely that he married the daughter of the king of Egypt, unless some natural daughter; but rather of some other person called by that name, who might either be an Israelite, or one brought by force out of Egypt by way of spoil. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-43 Genealogies. - In this chapter we have a further account of Judah, the most numerous and most famous of all the tribes; also an account of Simeon. The most remarkable person in this chapter is Jabez. We are not told upon what account Jabez was more honourable than his brethren; but we find that he was a praying man. The way to be truly great, is to seek to do God's will, and to pray earnestly. Here is the prayer he made. Jabez prayed to the living and true God, who alone can hear and answer prayer; and, in prayer he regarded him as a God in covenant with his people. He does not express his promise, but leaves it to be understood; he was afraid to promise in his own strength, and resolved to devote himself entirely to God. Lord, if thou wilt bless me and keep me, do what thou wilt with me; I will be at thy command and disposal for ever. As the text reads it, this was the language of a most ardent and affectionate desire, Oh that thou wouldest bless me! Four things Jabez prayed for. 1. That God would bless him indeed. Spiritual blessings are the best blessings: God's blessings are real things, and produce real effects. 2. That He would enlarge his coast. That God would enlarge our hearts, and so enlarge our portion in himself, and in the heavenly Canaan, ought to be our desire and prayer. 3. That God's hand might be with him. God's hand with us, to lead us, protect us, strengthen us, and to work all our works in us and for us, is a hand all-sufficient for us. 4. That he would keep him from evil, the evil of sin, the evil of trouble, all the evil designs of his enemies, that they might not hurt, nor make him a Jabez indeed, a man of sorrow. God granted that which he requested. God is ever ready to hear prayer: his ear is not now heavy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His wife - i. e. Mered's. Mered, it would seem, had two wives, Bithiah, an Egyptian woman, and a Jewish wife (see the margin), whose name is not given. If Mered was a chief of rank, Bithlah may have been married to him with the consent of her father, for the Egyptian kings often gave their daughters in marriage to foreigners. Or she may have elected to forsake her countrymen and cleave to a Jewish husband, becoming a convert to his religion. Her name, Bithiah, "daughter of Yahweh," is like that of a convert. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. Jehudijah&#8212;"the Jewess," to distinguish her from his other wife, who was an Egyptian. This passage records a very interesting fact&#8212;the marriage of an Egyptian princess to a descendant of Caleb. The marriage must have taken place in the wilderness. The barriers of a different national language and national religion kept the Hebrews separate from the Egyptians; but they did not wholly prevent intimacies, and even occasional intermarriages between private individuals of the two nations. Before such unions, however, could be sanctioned, the Egyptian party must have renounced idolatry, and this daughter of Pharaoh, as appears from her name, had become a convert to the worship of the God of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His wife; </span> either Ezra’s wife, or rather, another wife of Mered. <span class="ital">Jehudijah</span>; or, <span class="ital">the Jewess</span>; so called to distinguish her from his Egyptian wife here following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">These are the sons, </span> to wit, Miriam, and the rest following, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-17.htm" title="And the sons of Ezra were, Jether, and Mered, and Epher, and Jalon: and she bore Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa.">1 Chronicles 4:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The daughter of Pharaoh; </span> either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Chelub, another form of the name Caleb or Chelubai (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a>), is distinguished from the better known Caleb son of Hezron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>), and from the son of Jephunneh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-15.htm">1 Chronicles 4:15</a>), by the additional clause, "the son of Shuah." Shuah is not met with elsewhere, but is without reason identified with Hushah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>, by the older commentators. Mehir the father of Eshton is likewise unknown. Eshton begat the house (the family) of Rapha, of whom also nothing further is said; for they can be connected neither with the Benjamite Rapha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-2.htm">1 Chronicles 8:2</a>) nor with the children of Rapha (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-6.htm">1 Chronicles 20:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-8.htm">1 Chronicles 20:8</a>). Paseah and Tehinnah are also unknown, for it is uncertain whether the sons of Paseah mentioned among the Nethinim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-49.htm">Ezra 2:49</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-51.htm">Nehemiah 7:51</a>, have any connection with our Paseah. Tehinnah is called "father of the city of Nahash." The latter name is probably not properly the name of a town, but rather the name of a person Nahash, not unlikely the same as the father of Abigail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>), the step-sister of David (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-16.htm">1 Chronicles 2:16</a>). The men (or people) of Rechah are unknown. </body></html>
