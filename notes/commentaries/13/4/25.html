The most remarkable person in this chapter is Jabez. We are not told upon what account Jabez was more honourable than his brethren; but we find that he was a praying man. The way to be truly great, is to seek to do God's will, and to pray earnestly. Here is the prayer he made. Jabez prayed to the living and true God, who alone can hear and answer prayer; and, in prayer he regarded him as a God in covenant with his people. He does not express his promise, but leaves it to be understood; he was afraid to promise in his own strength, and resolved to devote himself entirely to God. Lord, if thou wilt bless me and keep me, do what thou wilt with me; I will be at thy command and disposal for ever. As the text reads it, this was the language of a most ardent and affectionate desire, Oh that thou wouldest bless me! Four things Jabez prayed for. 1. That God would bless him indeed. Spiritual blessings are the best blessings: God's blessings are real things, and produce real effects. 2. That He would enlarge his coast. That God would enlarge our hearts, and so enlarge our portion in himself, and in the heavenly Canaan, ought to be our desire and prayer. 3. That God's hand might be with him. God's hand with us, to lead us, protect us, strengthen us, and to work all our works in us and for us, is a hand all-sufficient for us. 4. That he would keep him from evil, the evil of sin, the evil of trouble, all the evil designs of his enemies, that they might not hurt, nor make him a Jabez indeed, a man of sorrow. God granted that which he requested. God is ever ready to hear prayer: his ear is not now heavy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Among plants and hedges - Rather, "in Netaim and Gederah" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>.<p>With the king - Or, probably, "on the king's property."

The difference in several particulars of the genealogy given here from that given in other passages is occasioned by some of the persons mentioned having more than one name [compare Ge 46:10; Ex 6:15; Nu 26:12].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shallum his son, </span> i.e. son of Saul last mentioned. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Shallum his son,....

The singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; is peculiar, but has analogies in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-21.htm">1 Chronicles 3:21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-23.htm">1 Chronicles 3:23</a>. Of the names of his sons, Jether and Epher again occur, the former in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-53.htm">1 Chronicles 2:53</a>, and the latter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-33.htm">1 Chronicles 1:33</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-24.htm">1 Chronicles 5:24</a>, but in other families. Jalon, on the contrary, is found only here. The children of two wives of Mered are enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-17.htm">1 Chronicles 4:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-18.htm">1 Chronicles 4:18</a>, but in a fashion which is quite unintelligible, and shows clear traces of a corruption in the text. For (1) the name of a woman as subject of &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;, "and she conceived (bare)," is wanting; and (2) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-18.htm">1 Chronicles 4:18</a> the names of two women occur, Jehudijah and Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh. But the sons of Jehudijah are first given, and there follows thereupon the formula, "and these are the sons of Bithiah," without any mention of the names of these sons. This manifest confusion Bertheau has sought to remove by a happy transposition of the words. He suggests that the words, "and these are the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered had taken," should be placed immediately after &#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;. "By this means we obtain (1) the missing subject of &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;;   (2) the definite statement that Mered had two wives, with whom he begat sons; and (3) an arrangement by which the sons are enumerated after the names of their respective mothers." After this transposition the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-17.htm">1 Chronicles 4:17</a> would read thus: "And the sons of Ezra are Jether, Mered, ... and Jalon; and these are the sons of Bithia the daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered took; and she conceived (and bare) Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah, the father of Eshtemoa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-18.htm">1 Chronicles 4:18</a>), and his wife Jehudijah bore Jered the father of Gedor, etc." This conjecture commends itself by its simplicity, and by the clearness which it brings into the words. From them we then learn that two families, who dwelt in a number of the cities of Judah, were descended from Mered the son of Ezra by his two wives. We certainly know no more details concerning them, as neither Mered not his children are met with elsewhere. From the circumstance, however, that the one wife was a daughter of Pharaoh, we may conclude that Mered lived before the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. The name Miriam, which Moses' sister bore, is here a man's name. The names introduced by &#1488;&#1489;&#1497; are the names of towns. Ishbah is father (lord) of the town Eshtemoa, in the mountains of Judah, now Semua, a village to the south of Hebron, with considerable ruins dating from ancient times (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-50.htm">Joshua 15:50</a>). &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; means properly "the Jewess," as distinguished from the Egyptian woman, Pharaoh's daughter. Gedor is a town in the high lands of Judah (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>). Socho, in the low land of Judah, now Shuweikeh, in Wady Sumt (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>). Zanoah is the name of a town in the high lands of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-56.htm">Joshua 15:56</a> (which has not yet been discovered), and of a town in the low land, now Zanua, not far from Zoreah, in an easterly direction (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a>). Perhaps the latter is here meant. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-19.htm">1 Chronicles 4:19</a>, "the sons of the wife of Hodiah, the sister of Naham, are the father of Keilah the Garmite, and Eshtemoa the Maachathite." The stat. contr. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; before &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; shows that Hodiah is a man's name. Levites of this name are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-7.htm">Nehemiah 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-5.htm">Nehemiah 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-11.htm">Nehemiah 10:11</a>. The relationship of Hodiah and Naham to the persons formerly named is not given. &#1511;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; is a locality in the low land of Judah not yet discovered (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>). The origin of the Epithet &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; we do not know. Before &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;, &#1488;&#1489;&#1497; with &#1493; copul. is probably to be repeated; and the Maachathite, the chief of a part of the inhabitants of Eshtemoa, is perhaps a descendant of Caleb by Maachah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-48.htm">1 Chronicles 2:48</a>).</body></html>
