The lot was not applied indiscriminately to all the 24 courses, but was only used to settle which course of Asaph, which of Jeduthun, and which of Heman, should on each occasion be taken. Asaph was given the precedence over his brethren, and his four courses were assigned the first, and then each alternate place. Jeduthun took rank next, and received alternate places, first with Asaph, and then with Heman, until his courses were exhausted. After this, all the later places fell necessarily to Heman, whose courses continue without interruption from the 15th. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 25:8-31.

The lot was cast to determine the precedence of the classes or divisions over which the musical leaders presided; and, in order to secure an impartial arrangement of their order, the master and his assistants, the teacher and his scholars, in each class or company took part in this solemn casting of lots. In the first catalogue given in this chapter the courses are classed according to their employment as musicians. In the second, they are arranged in the order of their service.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph,....

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a> the same thing is predicated also of Jeduthun, and in the same sense the prophet Gad is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-9.htm">1 Chronicles 21:9</a> David's seer. &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the Masoretes have connected with the preceding, by placing Athnach under the &#1511;&#1512;&#1503;, and the phrase has been wholly misunderstood by the Rabbins and Christian commentators. Berth., e.g., connects it with &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, and translates, "to sound loud upon horns, according to the divine command," referring to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-15.htm">2 Chronicles 29:15</a>, where, however, both meaning and accentuation forbid us to connect &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; with what follows. This interpretation of the words is thoroughly wrong, not only because the Levites under Heman's direction did not blow horns, the horn not being one of the instruments played by the Levites in connection with the worship, but also because on linguistic grounds it is objectionable. &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; .el never has the signification to blow the horn; for to elevate the horn signifies everywhere to heighten the power of any one, or unfold, show power; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-14.htm">Psalm 148:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-11.htm">Psalm 92:11</a>, etc. That is the meaning of the phrase here, and the words are to be connected, according to their sense, with what follows: "to elevate the horn," i.e., to give power, God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters; i.e., to make Heman's race mighty for the praise of God, God gave him so many sons and daughters. </body></html>
