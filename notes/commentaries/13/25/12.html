To prophesy, in this place, means praising God with great earnestness and devout affections, under the influences of the Holy Spirit. In raising these affections, poetry and music were employed. If the Spirit of God do not put life and fervour into our devotions, they will, however ordered, be a lifeless, worthless form.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As well the small as the great - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>. The lot was not applied indiscriminately to all the 24 courses, but was only used to settle which course of Asaph, which of Jeduthun, and which of Heman, should on each occasion be taken. Asaph was given the precedence over his brethren, and his four courses were assigned the first, and then each alternate place. Jeduthun took rank next, and received alternate places, first with Asaph, and then with Heman, until his courses were exhausted. After this, all the later places fell necessarily to Heman, whose courses continue without interruption from the 15th. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 25:8-31. Their Division by Lot into Four and Twenty Orders.<p>8. they cast lots, ward against ward&#8212;"Ward" is an old English word for "division" or "company." The lot was cast to determine the precedence of the classes or divisions over which the musical leaders presided; and, in order to secure an impartial arrangement of their order, the master and his assistants, the teacher and his scholars, in each class or company took part in this solemn casting of lots. In the first catalogue given in this chapter the courses are classed according to their employment as musicians. In the second, they are arranged in the order of their service.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph,....

Bertheau supplies after &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; the name Heman, and thereby the first half of the verse contradicts the second, which he correctly understands to refer to the twenty-four persons enumerated. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">1 Chronicles 25:7</a> the total number is given. Their number (the number) of the sons of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman (i.e., of the twenty-four 4 + 6 + 14 mentioned by name), with their brethren, was 288 (24 x 12); whence we learn that each of those named had eleven &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, all of them &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, learned, practised in song for Jahve.

Their number was 288, and these were divided into twenty-four choirs (classes). David had, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>, appointed 4000 Levites for the performance of the music. Of these, 288 were &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; skilled in song; the others were scholars (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;), as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a> shows, where &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; are the two categories into which the musicians are divided. </body></html>
