There can be no doubt at all that it contains no allusion whatever to the horn as an instrument of sound (the almost solitary approach to which use of the word is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>), but that it falls in with the very frequent <span class="accented">figurative</span> use of the phrase as it occurs in the very same words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-5.htm">Psalm 75:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1, 10</a>, etc.), and which means "to add to the strength" or "honour" of any one. The allusion is to the number of Heman's children being a mark of the honour God set on him. The words cannot go with the latter part of the verse, while the conjunction (<span class="accented">vav</span>) in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> opens it.

As to Jaaziah and his sons, see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-31.htm">1 Chronicles 23:31</a>. As Mahli's son Eleazar had no sons, only Jerahmeel from his second son Kish, as head of the class formed by Mahli's sons, is named. Of Mushi's sons only the names of the four fathers'-houses into which they fell are mentioned, the chiefs of the classes not being noticed. The heads mentioned in our section are fifteen in all; and supposing that in the cases of the fathers'-houses of the Hebronites and of the Merarite branch of the Mushes, where the heads of the classes are not named, each father's-house formed only one class, we would have only fifteen classes. It is, however, quite conceivable that many of the fathers'-houses of the Hebronites and Mushes were so numerous as to form more than one class; and so out of the Levite families mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20-29</a> twenty-four classes could be formed. The subscription, that they cast the lot like their brethren, makes this probable; and the analogy of the division of the musicians into twenty-four classes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25</a>) turns the probability that the Levites who were appointed to perform service for the priests, were divided into the same number of classes, into a certainty, although we have no express statement to that effect, and in the whole Old Testament no information as to the order of succession of the Levites is anywhere to be found.</body></html>
