To prophesy, in this place, means praising God with great earnestness and devout affections, under the influences of the Holy Spirit. In raising these affections, poetry and music were employed. If the Spirit of God do not put life and fervour into our devotions, they will, however ordered, be a lifeless, worthless form.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Under the hands of Asaph ... - That is to say, "under the direction of Asaph" - who himself "prophesied," or performed the sacred services, "under the direction of the king." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. according to the order of the king&#8212;Hebrew, "by the hands of the king," that is, "according to the king's order," under the personal superintendence of Asaph and his colleagues.<p>which prophesied&#8212;that is, in this connection, played with instruments. This metaphorical application of the term "prophecy" most probably originated in the practice of the prophets, who endeavored to rouse their prophetic spirit by the animating influence of music (see on [403]2Ki 3:15). It is said that Asaph did this "according to David's order," because by royal appointment he officiated in the tabernacle on Zion (1Ch 16:37-41), while other leaders of the sacred music were stationed at Gibeon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Of Heman: the sons of Heman,....

In this place the Chronicler (or the authority from whom he drew the list) has so arranged the names as to suggest a sentence (extending to the end of the verse) which runs somewhat as follows:—<span class="ital">Have mercy upon me, O Lord, have mercy upon me; I have magnified and exalted</span> [<span class="ital">thy</span>] <span class="ital">help; I spake of it sitting in affliction; grant us still</span> [<span class="ital">thy</span>] <span class="ital">visions</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The two names <span class="cmt_word">Uzziel</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Shebuel</span>, in this verse, reappear respectively in vers. 18, 20, as <span class="accented">Azareel</span> and <span class="accented">Shubael.</span> It is remarkable that the ninth and tenth names of this list, with the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth, when put together, run into two lines of verse, which may be translated, "These bestowed great and high help; I have abundantly uttered oracles." Ewald suggests that these may be the commencing lines of some ancient prophet's oracles (Ewald, 'Lehrbueh der H. Spr.,' &sect; 274, S. 672, 7th edit., cited by Keil). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The classes of the Merarites. As to Jaaziah and his sons, see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-31.htm">1 Chronicles 23:31</a>. As Mahli's son Eleazar had no sons, only Jerahmeel from his second son Kish, as head of the class formed by Mahli's sons, is named. Of Mushi's sons only the names of the four fathers'-houses into which they fell are mentioned, the chiefs of the classes not being noticed. The heads mentioned in our section are fifteen in all; and supposing that in the cases of the fathers'-houses of the Hebronites and of the Merarite branch of the Mushes, where the heads of the classes are not named, each father's-house formed only one class, we would have only fifteen classes. It is, however, quite conceivable that many of the fathers'-houses of the Hebronites and Mushes were so numerous as to form more than one class; and so out of the Levite families mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20-29</a> twenty-four classes could be formed. The subscription, that they cast the lot like their brethren, makes this probable; and the analogy of the division of the musicians into twenty-four classes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25</a>) turns the probability that the Levites who were appointed to perform service for the priests, were divided into the same number of classes, into a certainty, although we have no express statement to that effect, and in the whole Old Testament no information as to the order of succession of the Levites is anywhere to be found.</body></html>
