For, like the priests and Levites, they were divided into twenty-four courses of twelve men each, equal to two hundred eighty-eight, who served a week in rotation; and these, half of whom officiated every week with a proportionate number of assistants, were skilful and experienced musicians, capable of leading and instructing the general musical corps, which comprised no less than four thousand (1Ch 23:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All that were cunning; </span> who were so skilful that they were able to teach others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Two hundred fourscore and eight; </span> which, together with their scholars, make up the four thousand mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm" title="Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.">1 Chronicles 23:5</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So the number of them, with their brethren,....

These brethren (partly composed of their <span class="accented">sons</span>, as appears from vers. 9-31) were to aid in the songs of the Lord, and were apparently under instruction for that purpose. Each one of the twenty-four had eleven associated subordinates with him, and for whose instruction and service he was probably answerable. These would, of course, multiply up to the <span class="cmt_word">two hundred four score and eight</span> mentioned in the verse. This verse appears (contrary to the interpretation of Keil, Bertheau, and others) with sufficient precision to mark <span class="accented">two</span> classes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, the latter <span class="accented">not</span> embracing the former, but the two together making up the two hundred and eighty-eight spoken cf. These two classes will surely satisfy the "teacher and the scholar" classification of the following verse; the classes are denoted by the same Hebrew roots. In ver. 7 the passive Pual participle of the instructed and the Hiphil participle of the cunning, or skilled, correspond exactly with the "scholar" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) and the "teacher" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) of ver. 8. The contents of vers. 9-31 point to the same, being as they are without an allusion to any other outsiders - to any but the already introduced names of "sons" and "brethren." The supposing, therefore, of any allusion here to the "four thousand" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a> seems unnecessary and unnatural in whatever way they were distributed - and probably enough it was in an analogous manner - no distinct reference is made to them here. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The twenty-four classes of musicians. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>.
