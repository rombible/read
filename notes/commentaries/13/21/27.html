And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2Samuel 24:16-17</a>) equally makes the angel a “real concrete being,” and <span class= "ital">not</span> a “personification,” as Reuss will have it.<p><span class= "bld">Sheath</span> (<span class= "ital">nādān</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>—A word only found here.

These concluding remarks are not read in Samuel, but the writer, no doubt, found some basis for them in his special source. They tell us how it was that Oman’s threshingfloor became recognised as a permanent sanctuary, and the site ordained for the future Temple. They thus form a transition to the account of David’s preparations for the building (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/22-2.htm" title="And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew worked stones to build the house of God.">1Chronicles 22:2-19</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He answered him from heaven by fire - This fact is not mentioned by the author of Samuel, since his object is to give an account of the sin of David, its punishment, and the circumstances by which that punishment was brought to a close, not to connect those circumstances with anything further in the history. With the writer of Chronicles the case is different. He would probably have omitted the whole narrative, as he did the sin of David in the matter of Uriah, but for its connection with the fixing of the temple site <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22.htm">1 Chronicles 22</a>. It was no doubt mainly the fact that God answered him by fire from heaven on this altar, which determined David, and Solomon after him, to build the temple on the spot so consecrated. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. David built there an altar&#8212;He went in procession with his leading men from the royal palace, down Mount Zion, and through the intervening city. Although he had plenty of space on his own property, he was commanded, under peremptory direction, to go a considerable distance from his home, up Mount Moriah, to erect an altar on premises which he had to buy.

In saying this, however, he himself has not perceived that <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-20.htm">2 Samuel 24:20</a> (Sam.) does not correspond to the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-20.htm">1 Chronicles 21:20</a> of the Chronicle at all, but to the <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-21.htm">1 Chronicles 21:21</a>, where the words, "and Araunah looked out (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1507;) and saw the king," as parallel to the words, "and Ornan looked (&#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;) and saw David." The <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-20.htm">1 Chronicles 21:20</a> of the Chronicle contains a statement which is not found in Samuel, that Ornan (Araunah), while threshing with his four sons, turned and saw the angel, and being terrified at the sight, hid himself with his sons. After that, David with his train came from Zion to the threshing-floor in Mouth Moriah, and Araunah looking out saw the king, and came out of the threshing-floor to meet him, with deep obeisance. This narrative contains nothing improbable, nothing to justify us in having recourse to critical conjecture. </body></html>
