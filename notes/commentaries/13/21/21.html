But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It has been observed that it is only in books of a late period that Angels are brought forward as intermediaries between God and the prophets. This, no doubt, is true; and it is certainly unlikely that the records, from which the author of Chronicles drew, spoke of Gad as receiving his knowledge of God's will from an angel. The touch may be regarded as coming from the writer of Chronicles himself, who expresses the fact related by his authorities in the language of his own day (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-5.htm">Zechariah 5:5</a>; etc.); language, however, which we are not to regard as rhetorical, but as strictly in accordance with truth, since Angels were doubtless employed as media between God and the prophet as much in the time of David as in that of Zechariah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. Ornan was threshing wheat&#8212;If the census was entered upon in autumn, the beginning of the civil year, the nine and a half months it occupied would end at wheat harvest. The common way of threshing corn is by spreading it out on a high level area, and driving backwards and forwards upon it two oxen harnessed to a clumsy sledge with three rollers and some sharp spikes. The driver sits on his knees on the box, while another person is employed in drawing back the straw and separating it from the grain underneath. By this operation the chaff is very much chopped, and the grain threshed out.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">was threshing wheat</span>] By driving oxen over it; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-23.htm" title="And Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: see, I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.">1 Chronicles 21:23</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1500;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, "And God sent an angel towards Jerusalem," gives no suitable sense. Not because of the improbability that God sent the angel with the commission to destroy Jerusalem, and at the same moment gives the contrary command, "Stay now," etc. (Berth.); for the reason of this change is given in the intermediate clause, "and at the time of the destroying the Lord repented it," and command and prohibition are not given "at the same moment;" but the difficulty lies in the indefinite &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; (without the article). For since the angel of Jahve is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-12.htm">1 Chronicles 21:12</a> as the bringer of the pestilence, in our verse, if it treats of the sending of this angel to execute the judgment spoken of, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; must necessarily be used, or &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>; the indefinite &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; can by no means be used for it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a> we read, instead of the words in question, &#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, "and the angel stretched out his hand towards Jerusalem;" and Bertheau thinks that the reading &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (in the Chron.) has arisen out of that, by the letters &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1492; being exchanged for &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; being substituted for this divine name, as is often the case in the Chronicle; while Movers, S. 91, on the contrary, considers the reading of the Chronicle to be original, and would read &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; in Samuel. But in that way Movers leaves the omission of the article before &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; in the Chronicle unexplained; and Bertheau's conjecture is opposed by the improbability of such a misunderstanding of a phrase so frequent and so unmistakeable as &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, as would lead to the exchange supposed, ever occurring. But besides that, in Samuel the simple &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; is strange, for the angel has not been spoken of there at all before, and the lxx have consequently explained the somewhat obscure &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; by &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. This explanation suggests the way in which the reading of our text arose. The author of the Chronicle, although he had already made mention of the &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-12.htm">1 Chronicles 21:12</a>, wrote in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15</a> &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, "the angel of God stretched (his hand) out towards Jerusalem," using &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; instead of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, - as, for example, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-20.htm">Judges 6:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-9.htm">Judges 13:9</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-13.htm">Judges 13:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-15.htm">Judges 13:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17</a>. &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; alternates with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498;, and omitting &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, as is often done, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>, etc. By a copyist &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; and &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; have been transposed, and &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; was then taken by the Masoretes for an accusative, and pointed accordingly. The expression is made clearer by &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, "And as he destroyed, Jahve saw, and it repented Him of the evil." The idea is: Just as the angel had begun to destroy Jerusalem, it repented God. &#1512;&#1489;, adverb, "enough," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>, etc., with a dativ commodi, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Deuteronomy 1:6</a>, etc. Bertheau has incorrectly denied this meaning of the word, connecting &#1512;&#1489; with &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>, and desiring to alter our text to make it conform to that. In 2nd Samuel also &#1512;&#1489; is an adverb, as Thenius also acknowledges. </body></html>
