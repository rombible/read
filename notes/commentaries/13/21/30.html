A more natural explanation is that the menacing aspect of the apparition overawed the king, so that he durst not follow the usual course in the present instance. It made, as we should say, an indelible impression upon his mind as to the sanctity of the place where it appeared.

But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth.

Perceiving his sacrifice was acceptable, he proceeded to make additional offerings there, and seek favor by prayer and expiatory rites; for the dread of the menacing angel destroying Jerusalem while he was absent in the center of worship at Gibeon, especially reverence for the Divine Being, led him to continue his adorations in that place which God (2Ch 3:1) had hallowed by the tokens of His presence and gracious acceptance.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">David could not, </span> i.e. durst not. <span class="ital">Before it</span>, i.e. before the tabernacle, where the altar stood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To inquire of God, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">to seek God</span>, i.e. humbly to beg his favour by prayer and sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because of the sword of the angel of the Lord, </span> i.e. when he saw the angel stand with his drawn sword over Jerusalem, as is related above, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-15.htm" title="And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now your hand.
