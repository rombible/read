But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He answered him from heaven by fire - This fact is not mentioned by the author of Samuel, since his object is to give an account of the sin of David, its punishment, and the circumstances by which that punishment was brought to a close, not to connect those circumstances with anything further in the history. With the writer of Chronicles the case is different. He would probably have omitted the whole narrative, as he did the sin of David in the matter of Uriah, but for its connection with the fixing of the temple site <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22.htm">1 Chronicles 22</a>. It was no doubt mainly the fact that God answered him by fire from heaven on this altar, which determined David, and Solomon after him, to build the temple on the spot so consecrated. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. when David saw that the Lord had answered him &#8230;, he sacrificed there&#8212;or, "he continued to sacrifice there." Perceiving his sacrifice was acceptable, he proceeded to make additional offerings there, and seek favor by prayer and expiatory rites; for the dread of the menacing angel destroying Jerusalem while he was absent in the center of worship at Gibeon, especially reverence for the Divine Being, led him to continue his adorations in that place which God (2Ch 3:1) had hallowed by the tokens of His presence and gracious acceptance.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> When he perceived that his sacrifice there offered was acceptable to God, he proceeded to offer more sacrifices in that place, and did not go to Gibeon, as otherwise he should have done. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing floor Of Ornan the Jebusite,....

David was so impressed "at that <span class="accented">time</span>," by the answer given in fire from heaven, that he began systematically to sacrifice on the site of this threshing-floor, instead of going to the high place at Gibeon, where the altar of burnt offering still stood. To have attempted to go thither would not only have meant a long and wasteful delay, but would also have meant the neglecting of the august omen of the angel present.

In saying this, however, he himself has not perceived that <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-20.htm">2 Samuel 24:20</a> (Sam.) does not correspond to the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-20.htm">1 Chronicles 21:20</a> of the Chronicle at all, but to the <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-21.htm">1 Chronicles 21:21</a>, where the words, "and Araunah looked out (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1507;) and saw the king," as parallel to the words, "and Ornan looked (&#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;) and saw David." The <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-20.htm">1 Chronicles 21:20</a> of the Chronicle contains a statement which is not found in Samuel, that Ornan (Araunah), while threshing with his four sons, turned and saw the angel, and being terrified at the sight, hid himself with his sons. After that, David with his train came from Zion to the threshing-floor in Mouth Moriah, and Araunah looking out saw the king, and came out of the threshing-floor to meet him, with deep obeisance. This narrative contains nothing improbable, nothing to justify us in having recourse to critical conjecture. </body></html>
