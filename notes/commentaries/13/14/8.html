Samuel has, “went down to the stronghold.” The term “stronghold” (<span class= "ital">měçûdāh</span>) designates the “castle of Zion” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-5.htm" title="And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come here.

The latter is probably intended here. As on former occasions, the Philistine forces were likely to choose the route through the valley of Elah (coınp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/18-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.">1Samuel 18:1-2</a>), and David “went down” from Zion “to meet them” there.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-17 David's victories. - In this chapter we have an account of, 1.

From a careful comparison of this passage with the parallel and with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-12.htm">2 Samuel 23:12-14</a>, it appears likely that the meaning is that "David went out against them" after having "gone down" first to the "hold," probably at the "cave of Adullam" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-15.htm">1 Chronicles 11:15-17</a>). When it is said that the Philistines went up to seek David, the sequel makes it evident that they did not seek him as friends. And it is to be remembered that the Philistines held territory near Jerusalem at this time, and to the north of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-7.htm">1 Samuel 31:7-9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Instead of &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, that He (Jahve) had lifted up (&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, perf. Pi.), as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-12.htm">2 Samuel 5:12</a>, in the Chronicle we read &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, that his kingdom had been lifted up on high.

Niph., nisaa't having first been changed into &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, and thus contracted into &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;; cf. Ew. 194, b. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a> the same form is the infin. abs. Niph. &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is here, as frequently in the Chronicles, used to intensify the expression: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-17.htm">1 Chronicles 23:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-3.htm">1 Chronicles 29:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-1.htm">2 Chronicles 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>. With regard to the sons of David, see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5-8</a>.<p>In the account of the victories over the Philistines, the statement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17</a>) that David went down to the mountain-hold, which has no important connection with the main fact, and would have been for the readers of the Chronicle somewhat obscure, is exchanged in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-8.htm">1 Chronicles 14:8</a> for the more general expression &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;, "he went forth against them." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-14.htm">1 Chronicles 14:14</a>, the divine answer to David's question, whether he should march against the Philistines, runs thus: &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1492;&#1505;&#1489; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, Thou shalt not go up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the baca-bushes; - while in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-23.htm">2 Samuel 5:23</a>, on the contrary, we read: &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1492;&#1505;&#1489; &#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1505;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488; &#1500;&#1506;, Thou shalt not go up (i.e., advance against the enemy to attack them in front); turn thee behind them (i.e., to their rear), and come upon them over against the baca-bushes. Bertheau endeavours to get rid of the discrepancy, by supposing that into both texts corruptions have crept through transcribers' errors. He conjectures that the text of Samuel was originally &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, while in the Chronicle a transposition of the words &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; was occasioned by a copyist's error, which in turn resulted in the alteration of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; into &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;. This supposition, however, stands or falls with the presumption that by &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; (Sam.) an attack is forbidden; but for that presumption no tenable grounds exist: it would rather involve a contradiction between the first part of the divine answer and the second. The last clause, "Come upon them from over against the baca-bushes," shows that the attack was not forbidden; all that was forbidden was the making of the attack by advancing straight forward: instead of that, they were to try to fall upon them in the rear, by making a circuit. The chronicler consequently gives us an explanation of the ambiguous words of 2 Samuel, which might easily be misunderstood. As David's question was doubtless expressed as it is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-10.htm">1 Chronicles 14:10</a>, &#1492;&#1508;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, the answer &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; might be understood to mean, "Go not up against them, attack them not, but go away behind them;" but with that the following &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514;, "Come upon them from the baca-bushes," did not seem to harmonize. The chronicler consequently explains the first clauses of the answer thus: "Go not up straight behind them," i.e., advance not against them so as to attack them openly, "but turn thyself away from them," i.e., strike off in such a direction as to turn their flank, and come upon them from the front of the baca-bushes. In this way the apparently contradictory texts are reconciled without the alteration of a word. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-17.htm">1 Chronicles 14:17</a>, which is wanting in Samuel, the author concludes the account of these victories by the remark that they tended greatly to exalt the name of David among the nations. For similar reflections, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-29.htm">2 Chronicles 20:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-13.htm">2 Chronicles 14:13</a>; and for &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>. </body></html>
