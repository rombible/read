David's kingdom established. 2. His family built up. 3. His enemies defeated. This is repeated from 2Sa 5. Let the fame of David be looked upon as a type and figure of the exalted honour of the Son of David.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11-25</a>, the only important variations from which are in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4-7</a>, the list of the sons of David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a> note), and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a>, where the fact is added that the idols taken from the Philistines were burned. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 14:3-7.

His concubines are mentioned (1Ch 3:9), where also is given a list of his children (1Ch 14:5-8), and those born in Jerusalem (2Sa 5:14-16). In that, however, the names of Eliphalet and Nogah do not occur, and Beeliada appears to be the same as Eliada.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David's palace-building, wives and children, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1-7</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11-16</a>.

The explanation of it rather is, that the author of our Chronicle, for the reasons given in page 170, desired to represent David's design to bring the ark into the capital city of his kingdom as his first undertaking after he had won Jerusalem, and was consequently compelled to bring in the events of our chapter at a later period, and for that purpose this interval of three months seemed to offer him the fittest opportunity. The whole contents of our chapter have already been commented upon in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>, so that we need not here do more than refer to a few subordinate points. </body></html>
