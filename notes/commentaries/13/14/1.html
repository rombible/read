Hiram's Kindness to David; David's Felicity.<p>1. Now Hiram king of Tyre&#8212;[See on [377]2Sa 5:11]. The alliance with this neighboring king, and the important advantages derived from it, were among the most fortunate circumstances in David's reign. The providence of God appeared concurrent with His promise in smoothing the early course of his reign. Having conquered the Jebusites and made Zion the royal residence, he had now, along with internal prosperity, established an advantageous treaty with a neighboring prince; and hence, in immediate connection with the mention of this friendly league, it is said, "David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel."Hiram’s kindness to David, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.">1 Chronicles 14:1</a></span>.

Beside this Hiram or Huram, the king, there was another Hiram or Huram, the same king's chief artificer, and whom he sent to the help of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-11.htm">2 Chronicles 4:11, 16</a>). The willing aid which this king lent to David on this occasion, in supplying cedar timber and workmen, was "the commencement of that amity between the Tyriaus and the Hebrews, so mutually advantageous to the two nations, the one agricultural and the other commercial" (Milman's 'History of the Jews,' 1:239). The meaning of the name Hiram is probably "noble," or "highborn." This disposition, at all events, he seems to have illustrated in his generous friendship to David, Solomon, and their people. Very little to be relied upon is known of him outside Scripture, but his reign is said to have extended from  <span class="date">B.C. 1023-990</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the whole assembly approved of David's design (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, it is to do so  equals  so much we do), David collected the whole of Israel to carry it out. "The whole of Israel," from the southern frontier of Canaan to the northern; but of course all are not said to have been present, but there were numerous representatives from every part, - according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a>, a chosen number of 30,000 men. The &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, which is named as the southern frontier, is not the Nile, although it also is called &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>), and the name "the black river" also suits it (see Del. on Isaiah, loc. cit.); but is the &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; before, i.e., eastward from Egypt (&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;), i.e., the brook of Egypt, &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, the Rhinocorura, now el Arish, which in all accurate statements of the frontiers is spoken of as the southern, in contrast to the neighbourhood of Hamath, which was the northern boundary: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>. For the designation of the northern frontier, &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>. Kirjath-jearim, the Canaanitish Baalah, was known among the Israelites by the name Baale Jehudah or Kirjath-baal, as distinguished from other cities named after Baal, and is now the still considerable village Kureyeh el Enab; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>. In this fact we find the explanation of &#1497; &#1488;&#1500; &#1511; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-6.htm">1 Chronicles 13:6</a> : to Baalah, to Kirjath-jearim of Judah. The ark had been brought thither when the Philistines sent it back to Beth-shemesh, and had been set down in the house of Abinadab, where it remained for about seventy years; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6.htm">1 Samuel 6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>, and the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not to be translated "which is named name," which gives no proper sense. Translating it so, Bertheau would alter &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, according to an arbitrary conjecture of Thenius on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>, "who there (by the ark) is invoked." But were &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; the true reading, it could not refer to the ark, but only to the preceding &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, since in the whole Old Testament the idea that by or at the resting-place of the ark Jahve was invoked (which &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; would signify) nowhere occurs, since no one could venture to approach the ark. If &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; referred to &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, it would signify that Jahve was invoked at Kirjath-baal, that there a place of worship had been erected by the ark; but of that the history says nothing, and it would, moreover, be contrary to the statement that the ark was not visited in the days of Saul. We must consequently reject the proposal to alter &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; as useless and unsuitable, and seek for another explanation: we must take &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in the sense of &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2;, which it sometimes has; cf. Ew. 333, a.: "as he is called by name," where &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; does not refer only to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but also to the additional clause &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, and the meaning is that Jahve is invoked as He who is enthroned above the cherubim; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>. - On the following <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7-14</a>, cf. the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3-11</a>.</body></html>
