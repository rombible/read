Thus the true significance of Joshua’s position appears, and also the difference between Moses and all who followed him. Moses was the prophet <span class= "ital">“</span>whom the Lord knew face to face.” Joshua and <span class= "ital">all </span>his successors, from the least to the greatest, find their blessing and their portion in the careful study and fulfilment of the written word of God. It is also worthy of notice that God’s Word, from its very first appearance as a collective book (viz., the law), occupies the same position. It is supreme. It is set above Joshua. It is never superseded. And its authority is independent of its quantity. “The law of Moses,” “Moses and the prophets,” “The law, the prophets, and the Psalms,” are descriptions of the Bible differing in the quantity of the matter, but not differing in the authority they exercise or in their relation to the living church. “Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy of this book, and keep those things that are written therein,” are words that apply to Holy Scripture equally, in every stage, from the completion of the law of Moses to the completion of the entire book.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/1-8.htm" title="This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; but you shall meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success....">Joshua 1:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth — </span>That is, thou shalt constantly read it, and upon occasion discourse of it, and the sentence which shall come out of thy month, shall in all things be given according to this rule. <span class="ital">Day and night — </span>That is, diligently study, and upon all occasions consider what is God’s will and thy duty.

He is charged to meditate therein day and night, that he might understand it. Whatever affairs of this world we have to mind, we must not neglect the one thing needful. All his orders to the people, and his judgments, must be according to the law of God. Joshua must himself be under command; no man's dignity or dominion sets him above the law of God. He is to encourage himself with the promise and presence of God. Let not the sense of thine own infirmities dishearten thee; God is all-sufficient. I have commanded, called, and commissioned thee to do it, and will be sure to bear thee out in it. When we are in the way of duty, we have reason to be strong and very bold. Our Lord Jesus, as Joshua here, was borne up under his sufferings by a regard to the will of God, and the commandment from his Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Prosper - See the margin.

It is remarkable, however, that his courage and hope of victory were made to depend (see on [171]De 17:18) on his firm and inflexible adherence to the law of God, not only that regarding the extirpation of the Canaanites, but the whole divine code.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall not depart out of thy mouth, </span> i.e. thou shalt constantly read it, and upon occasion discourse of it, and the sentence which shall come out of thy mouth shall in all things be given according to this rule. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Meditate therein, </span> i.e. diligently study, and frequently and upon all occasions consider what is God’s will and thy duty.

There was a "book of the law" in Joshua's time, according to this early testimony, and we may conclude from vers. 3-7 that Deuteronomy formed a part of it (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19</a> for a similar precept. And for the fact see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Meditate therein</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, 63:7, 143:5, in the original.
