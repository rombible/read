He is charged to meditate therein day and night, that he might understand it. Whatever affairs of this world we have to mind, we must not neglect the one thing needful. All his orders to the people, and his judgments, must be according to the law of God. Joshua must himself be under command; no man's dignity or dominion sets him above the law of God. He is to encourage himself with the promise and presence of God. Let not the sense of thine own infirmities dishearten thee; God is all-sufficient. I have commanded, called, and commissioned thee to do it, and will be sure to bear thee out in it. When we are in the way of duty, we have reason to be strong and very bold. Our Lord Jesus, as Joshua here, was borne up under his sufferings by a regard to the will of God, and the commandment from his Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lebanon is spoken of as "this Lebanon," because visible from the neighborhood in which Israel was encamped. (Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8-9</a>.) "The wilderness" of the text is the Desert of Arabia, which forms the southern, as Lebanon does the northern, limit of the promised land. The boundaries on the east and west are likewise indicated; and the intervening territory is described generally as "all the land of the Hittites." The Hittites are properly the inhabitants of northern Canaan and Phoenicia (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a> note), but the name appears to be used here for the Canaanites in general, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>.

There shall not any man be able to stand before thee&#8212;Canaan was theirs by a divine grant; and the renewed confirmation of that grant to Joshua when about to lead the people into it, intimated not only a certain but an easy conquest. It is remarkable, however, that his courage and hope of victory were made to depend (see on [171]De 17:18) on his firm and inflexible adherence to the law of God, not only that regarding the extirpation of the Canaanites, but the whole divine code.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As I was with Moses, </span> to assist him against all his enemies, and in all the difficulties of governing this stiff-necked people, which Joshua might justly fear no less than the Canaanites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee; </span> I will not leave thee destitute either of inward support, or of outward assistance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life,....

And the people obeyed him; but he was not like Moses. "There arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face," i.e., so far as the miracles and signs were concerned which Moses did, by virtue of his divine mission, upon Pharaoh, his servants, and his land, and the terrible acts which he performed before the eyes of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-11.htm">Deuteronomy 34:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-12.htm">Deuteronomy 34:12</a>; vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-8.htm">Deuteronomy 26:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>). "Whom Jehovah knew:" not who knew Him, the Lord. "To know," like &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>, relates to the divine knowledge, which not only involves a careful observance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>), but is also a manifestation of Himself to man, a penetration of man with the spiritual power of God. Because he was thus known by the Lord, Moses was able to perform signs and wonders, and mighty, terrible acts, such as no other performed either before or after him. In this respect Joshua stood far below Moses, and no prophet arose in Israel like unto Moses. - This remark concerning Moses does not presuppose that a long series of prophets had already risen up since the time of Moses. When Joshua had defeated the Canaanites, and conquered their land with the powerful help of the Lord, which was still manifested in signs and wonders, and had divided it among the children of Israel, and when the tribes had settled down in their inheritance, so that the different portions of the land began to be called by the names of Naphtali, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Judah, as is the case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-2.htm">Deuteronomy 34:2</a>; the conviction might already have become established in Israel, that no other prophet would arise like Moses, to whom the Lord had manifested Himself with such signs and wonders before the Egyptians and the eyes of Israel. The position occupied by Joshua in relation to this his predecessor, as the continuer of his work, would necessarily awaken and confirm this conviction, in connection with what the Lord had said as to the superiority of Moses to all the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>.). Moses was the founder and mediator of the old covenant. As long as this covenant was to last, no prophet could arise in Israel like unto Moses. There is but One who is worthy of greater honour than Moses, namely, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, who is placed as the Son over all the house of God, in which Moses was found faithful as a servant (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2-6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), Jesus Christ, the founder and mediator of the new and everlasting covenant.</body></html>
