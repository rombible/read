The best we can ask of God for our magistrates, is, that they may have the presence of God; that will make them blessings to us, so that in seeking this for them, we consult our own interest. May we be enabled to enlist under the banner of the Captain of our salvation, to be obedient to his commands, and to fight the good fight of faith, with all that trust in and love his name, against all who oppose his authority; for whoever refuses to obey him must be destroyed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Armed - Rather, "arrayed" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a> note).<p>On this side Jordan - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>, note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. ye shall pass &#8230; armed&#8212;that is, officered or marshalled under five leaders in the old and approved caravan order (see on [174]Ex 13:18).<p>all the mighty men of valour&#8212;The words are not to be interpreted strictly as meaning the whole, but only the flower or choice of the fighting men (see on [175]Jos 4:12).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The same obedience which we owed, and those of us who are now alive generally performed, to Moses, we promise unto thee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Only the Lord thy God be with thee:</span> this is not a limitation of their obedience, as if they would not obey him any further or longer than he was prosperous or successful; but an additional prayer for him.

It certainly appears as though for the last two years of the wandering in the wilderness there was far less rebellion against Moses than before; and after the solemn repetition of the precepts of the law to the new generation which had arisen, given in the Book of Deuteronomy, there seems to have been no rebellion at all (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-63.htm">Numbers 26:63</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10-11</a><p>Preparations for Crossing the Jordan. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10-11</a>. For the purpose of carrying out the commands of the Lord, Joshua first of all directed the officers of the people (shoterim: see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5-6</a>), whose duty it was, as the keepers of the family registers, to attend not only to the levying of the men who were bound to serve in the army, but also to the circulation of the commands of the general, to issue orders to the people in the camp to provide themselves with food, so that they might cross the Jordan within three days, and take the land that was promised them by God. By zedah, provision for a journey (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-25.htm">Genesis 42:25</a>, etc.), we are not to understand manna, for that had already ceased (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>), but simply the natural produce of the inhabited country. The expression "in three days," i.e., as we may see from comparing <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-19.htm">Genesis 40:19</a>, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-20.htm">Genesis 40:20</a>, on the third day from the publication of the command, "will ye go over the Jordan," is not to be regarded as a prediction of the time when the crossing actually took place, but to be taken as the latest time that could be allowed to the people to prepare for crossing: viz., in this sense, "Prepare you victuals for crossing over the Jordan within three days," i.e., that you may be able to leave Shittim within that time, to cross over the Jordan, and commence the conquest of Canaan. If we understand the words in this way, they are in perfect harmony with <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a> and 3. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>, Joshua sent out spies from Shittim to Jericho, who were obliged to hide themselves for three days in the mountains after their flight from that city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-22.htm">Joshua 2:22</a>), before they could return to the Israelitish camp; so that they were absent three or four days at any rate, and came back at the earliest in the evening or night of the fourth day after they had been sent out. It was not till the morning after this that the Israelites left Shittim and proceeded to the Jordan, where they halted again. Then, three days afterwards, they went across the river (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1-2</a>), so that at least 4 + 1 + 3, i.e., eight whole days must have intervened between the day when the spies were sent out and the day on which the people crossed the river. Joshua no doubt intended to proceed to the Jordan and cross it within three days after despatching the spies; he therefore sent the spies to Jericho on the same day on which he issued the command to the people to prepare for crossing within three days, so that he might reasonably hope that they would fulfil their commission and return in two or three days. But as they were compelled to hide themselves for three days in the mountains, in consequence of the unexpected discovery of their arrival in Jericho, and the despatch of men in pursuit of them, Joshua could not remove with the people from Shittim and proceed to the Jordan till the day after their return; and even then he could not cross the river at once, but waited three days after reaching the bank of the river before he crossed to the other side (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>.).<p>(Note: In this way the different statements in the three chapters harmonize perfectly well. But the majority of commentators have arranged the order of succession differently and in a very arbitrary way, starting with the unwarrantable assumption that the time referred to in this verse, "within three days," is identical with that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-2.htm">Joshua 3:2</a>, "it came to pass after three days." Upon the strength of this groundless assumption, Knobel maintains that there is great confusion in the order of succession of the events described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1.htm">Joshua 1-3</a>, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a> is irreconcilable with <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1-6</a>, and that accounts written by three different authors have been mixed up together in these chapters. (For the different attempts to reconcile the accounts, see Keil's Commentary on Joshua, pp. 72-75, note, Eng. trans. Clark, 1857.)) </body></html>
