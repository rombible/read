We may compare this event, in its relation to Joshua, with the giving of the law from Sinai to Moses. Both were preceded by a three days’ notice and a sanctification of the people. Both were means employed by God to establish the leaders whom He had chosen in the position which He designed for them.

The word denotes (1) literally a “writer,” or “scribe;” then (2) an overseer, in whose office were combined various duties, including enrolments, orders &c., also genealogies; (3) a magistrate, prefect, leader of the people, especially, as here, the leaders, officers, of the Israelites in Egypt and in the desert.

Their duties were at once civil and military.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people.</span> The <span class="accented">Shoterim</span>, a term derived from the same root as an Arabic word signifying "to write." Different ideas have been entertained of their duties. Keil, Jahn (<span class="accented">Hebrew Commonwealth</span>), and others believe that they were genealogists; but it seems more probable that their original duties were to keep processes and minutes, and that, like our Indian "writers" and the "Master of the Rolls" at home, they exercised some kind of judicial functions, with which, moreover, active duties were sometimes combined. The idea that they were genealogists is contrary, as Gesenius shows, to the context in many places. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6-19</a>, they seem to have had to see that the specified tale of bricks was delivered up; and we know from the recently deciphered Egyptian inscriptions that very accurate registers of such matters were kept. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-2.htm">Joshua 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>, etc.) they appear to have exercised judicial functions in connection with the <span class="accented">"princes"</span> (not <span class="accented">"captains,"</span> as in our version, which would lead to the idea that they were military officers). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> they are connected with the elders. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a> they seem again to have exercised judicial functions, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-11.htm">2 Chronicles 26:11</a> their duty appears to have been to keep the muster rolls. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-7.htm">Proverbs 6:7</a> we find them once more with active duties as in the text. The LXX. equivalent; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a> by "town clerk," an officer with active as well as merely secretarial duties. Here they seem to have acted as officers of the commissariat, civil and military functions being naturally largely interchangeable in the then condition of the Israelitish people, just as they were in the early days of our Indian empire. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The boundaries of the land are given as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>, with the simple difference in form, that the boundary line from the desert (of Arabia) and Lebanon, i.e., from the southern and northern extremity, is drawn first of all towards the east to the great river, the Euphrates, and then towards the west to "the great sea, toward the going down of the sun," i.e., the Mediterranean; and then between these two termini ad quem the more precise definition is inserted, "all the land of the Hittites;" whereas in Deuteronomy the southern, northern, and eastern boundaries are placed in antithesis to the western boundary, and the more precise definition of the country to be taken is given by an enumeration of the different tribes that were to be destroyed by the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-23.htm">Deuteronomy 11:23</a>). On the oratorical character of these descriptions, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>. The demonstrative pronoun "this," in connection with Lebanon, may be explained from the fact that Lebanon, or at all events Anti-libanus, was visible from the Israelitish camp. The expression "the Hittites" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>) is used here in a broader sense for Canaanites in general, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>.
