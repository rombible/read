The best we can ask of God for our magistrates, is, that they may have the presence of God; that will make them blessings to us, so that in seeking this for them, we consult our own interest. May we be enabled to enlist under the banner of the Captain of our salvation, to be obedient to his commands, and to fight the good fight of faith, with all that trust in and love his name, against all who oppose his authority; for whoever refuses to obey him must be destroyed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Armed - Rather, "arrayed" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a> note).<p>On this side Jordan - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>, note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. ye shall pass &#8230; armed&#8212;that is, officered or marshalled under five leaders in the old and approved caravan order (see on [174]Ex 13:18).<p>all the mighty men of valour&#8212;The words are not to be interpreted strictly as meaning the whole, but only the flower or choice of the fighting men (see on [175]Jos 4:12).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In all that thou commandest him, </span> not repugnant to Godâ€™s commands; for none can be so foolish to think, that if he had commanded the people to blaspheme God, or worship idols, the people were obliged to obey him therein. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment,....

In recalling this condition to the recollection of the tribes referred to, Joshua follows the expressions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18-20</a>, where Moses himself recapitulates his former command, rather than the original passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>. The expression "this land" shows that the speaker was still on the other side of the Jordan. &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, with the loins girded, i.e., prepared for war, synonymous with &#1495;&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-32.htm">Numbers 32:32</a> (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>). &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, all the mighty men of valour, i.e., the grave warriors (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7</a>, and very frequently in the later books), is not common to this book and Deuteronomy, as Knobel maintains, but is altogether strange to the Pentateuch. The word "all" (v. 14, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-21.htm">Numbers 32:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-27.htm">Numbers 32:27</a>) must not be pressed. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>, there were only about 40,000 men belonging to the two tribes and a half who crossed the Jordan to take part in the war; whereas, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-7.htm">Numbers 26:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-18.htm">Numbers 26:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-34.htm">Numbers 26:34</a>, there were 110,000 men in these tribes who were capable of bearing arms, so that 70,000 must have remained behind for the protection of the women and children and of the flocks and herds, and to defend the land of which they had taken possession. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-15.htm">Joshua 1:15</a> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18</a>; and on the more minute definition of "on this side (lit. beyond) Jordan" by "toward the sun-rising," compare the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-19.htm">Numbers 32:19</a>. The answer of the two tribes and a half, in which they not only most cheerfully promise their help in the conquest of Canaan, but also express the wish that Joshua may have the help of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-17.htm">Joshua 1:17</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>), and after threatening all who refuse obedience with death, close with the divine admonition, "only be strong and of a good courage" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-18.htm">Joshua 1:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>), furnishes a proof of the wish that inspired them to help their brethren, that all the tribes might speedily enter into the peaceable possession of the promised inheritance. The expression "rebel against the commandment" is used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-26.htm">Deuteronomy 1:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-43.htm">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-23.htm">Deuteronomy 9:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14</a>, to denote resistance to the commandments of the Lord; here it denotes opposition to His representative, the commander chosen by the Lord, which was to be punished with death, according to the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>. </body></html>
