But it does not seem possible to assign any other meaning to the word except that of provision for a journey or for a warlike expedition. Perhaps the order was intended to prepare the Israelites for the transition from the manna to other food. It may be also that the manna which supported them in their pilgrimage through the wilderness was not so fit to sustain them in the warfare which they were about to begin. For the phrase itself, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-39.htm" title="And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.">Exodus 12:39</a> : “They were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither <span class= "ital">had they prepared for themselves any victual.” </span>When there was a difficulty in obtaining other provision, God gave His people manna. Now, when they could easily provide food for themselves, He would not support them in idleness; and perhaps this is the common-sense view of the order given in the text. If called to any expedition which would take them far from the camp, the manna would not be within reach of all.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Joshua says to the people, Ye shall pass over Jordan, and shall possess the land; because God had said so to him. We honour the truth of God, when we stagger not at the promise of God. The two tribes and a half were to go over Jordan with their brethren. When God, by his providence, has given us rest, we ought to consider what service we may do to our brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Prepare you victuals - The order was probably given with the knowledge that the manna would cease when the host crossed the Jordan <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>, and possibly because amidst their preparations there might not be opportunity to gather it in sufficient quantity. Nor does it appear that manna ever formed the whole and sole sustenance of the people. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a> note.)<p>It is the view of the majority of commentators - Jewish and Christian, ancient and modern - that the "three days" here named are identical with those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-2.htm">Joshua 3:2</a>; and that the command of Joshua in the text was not in fact given until after the return of the spies. Here, as elsewhere in the Hebrew historical books and frequently in the Gospels, the order of time is superseded by the order of thought. For the purpose if the writer was not historical merely; it was, on the contrary, mainly religious and theoretical. Intending, then, to exhibit God as accomplishing His promises to the covenant-people, he begins by informing us that God gave the word and set Joshua and the host actually in motion to take possession of their inheritance. Having placed this leading fact in the forefront, he returns to mention in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a> certain transactions closely relevant to the early stages of Joshua's conquests, but which had in fact happened before the camp was removed from the plains of Moab and immediately after the expiration of the thirty days' mourning for Moses. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>. The order of events was probably the following - 3rd Nisan, the spies are sent out <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>; 6th, the spies return <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-23.htm">Joshua 2:23</a>; 7th, the camp is removed from Shittim to the bank of Jordan <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>, and the command <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a> is issued; 10th, the river is crossed <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13. command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals&#8212;not manna, which, though it still fell, would not keep; but corn, sheep, and articles of food procurable in the conquered countries.<p>for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan&#8212;that is, the third day, according to Hebrew idiom&#8212;the time allotted for getting ready before the encampment in Abel-Shittim broke up and they removed to the desert bank of the river where no victuals were available. At the same time Joshua himself convened the two and a half tribes which had settled east of Jordan, to remind them of their promise (Nu 32:1-42) to assist their brethren in the conquest of western Canaan. Their readiness to redeem their pledge and the terms in which they answered the appeal of Joshua displayed to great advantage their patriotic and pious feelings at so interesting a crisis.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Prepare you victuals; </span> for although manna was given them to supply their want of ordinary provisions in the wilderness; yet they were allowed, when they had opportunity, to purchase other provisions, and did so, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-6.htm" title="You shall buy meat of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.">Deu 2:6</a>,28</span>. And now having been some time in the land of the Amorites, and together with manna used themselves to other food which that country plentifully supplied them with, they are warned to furnish themselves therewith for their approaching march. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Within three days.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> How can this be, when the spies, who were not yet sent away, continued three days hid in the mountains, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-22.htm" title="And they went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.">Joshua 2:22</a></span>, and the people passed not over till three days after the spies returned? <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-2.htm" title="And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;">Joshua 3:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> These words, though placed here, seem not to have been delivered by Joshua till after the return of the spies; such transpositions being so frequent in Scripture, that interpreters have formed this general rule, <span class="ital">that there is no certain order, no former nor latter</span>, in the histories of the Scripture.

The whole camp of Israel, consisting of six hundred thousand fighting men: <p>and command the people; even all the people of Israel; this includes women as well as men, for the one, as well as the other, were to do what follows, and especially it may seem the business of the former: <p>saying, prepare ye victuals; this must be understood; as Kimchi observes, of other sorts of food besides bread; for they had manna, the bread of heaven, which fell about their tents every morning, so that they were sufficiently provided with that always, and which did not cease until they had entered the land, even until the sixteenth of Nisan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>; though indeed, as Abendana observes, that might be said to be prepared, it being ground in mills, and beat in mortars, and made cakes of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-8.htm">Numbers 11:8</a>; but rather this designs meat and other provisions, which being upon the borders of Moab and Midian, they could furnish themselves with for their money; and besides, they were in the possession of a fine country, of Bashan and Gilead, they had taken from Sihon and Og. Jarchi interprets it of everything fit for journeying, and arms for war, with which they were supplied from the spoils of their enemies, the Egyptians at the Red sea, Amalek at Rephidim, and the Amorites and Midianites lately smitten by them; and to this sense Josephus (m) seems to agree: <p>for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan: or at the end of three days, as the Targum of Jonathan; and so Jarchi, while there are yet three days, after that ye shall pass over: but here arises a difficulty to be reconciled, how this could be done three days after, when the spies, which Joshua is afterward said to send into the land, stayed three days in the mountains, besides the time of their going, and returning, and stay at Rahab's house; and it was not till after their return that the camp began to move; to which it may be observed, that though the affair of the spies is afterward related, they might have been sent by Joshua before this order was given to prepare for the journey, and of this opinion are several of the Jewish writers (n): this being the case, they might return before the expiration of these three days, at the end of which Joshua, with the whole host, moved, agreeably to these orders: <p>to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it; which must be a great inducement and encouragement to them to observe his instructions, and go over with him. <p>(m) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 1. sect. 1.((n) Jarchi, Ben Gersom, &amp; Abarbinel in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</span><p>(g) Meaning, from the day that this was proclaimed, Jos 3:2.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Prepare you victuals</span>] The word denotes (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">food got in hunting;</span> (<span class="ital">b</span>) <span class="ital">food of any kind</span>, especially <span class="ital">provisions for a journey</span>.

See below, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm" title="And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.">Joshua 5:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">within three days</span>] Comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/3-1.htm" title="And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over....">Joshua 3:1-2</a>. The order appears to have been given on the 7th day of the month Nisan, for the people crossed the Jordan on the 10th. The expedition, therefore, of the spies occupied from the 5th to the 8th of the month, and the message to the eastern tribes was sent during the same interval.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prepare you victuals.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">game</span>, the term being applied to meat obtained by hunting. Thus it is applied by Isaac to Esau's venison in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>. Here it means <span class="accented">food of any kind</span>, but especially animal food. It is therefore obvious that the miraculous supply of manna was soon to cease (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Within three days.</span> Much difficulty has been created here by the fact that another three days are mentioned in chap. 3:2 as elapsing after the return of the spies, which has been supposed to have taken place between this command and the period then mentioned. Three more days were spent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-22.htm">Joshua 2:22</a>) by the spies in eluding the pursuit of the men of Jericho - one day in going thither, and one more in returning to Moses. Consequently eight days, if not more (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>), must have elapsed between this proclamation and the actual crossing of the Jordan. But when we remember that the Hebrew language possesses no pluperfect tense, that there are many instances, such as (very probably) <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, and more certainly <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-18.htm">Genesis 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18, 32</a>, where the Hebrew narrative has clearly departed from the chronological order, and that the chronology is obscured by this chasm in the Hebrew linguistic system, we may suppose that the narrative in the second chapter is parenthetical, and relates to events which occurred before the occasion now spoken cf. This is the view taken by Josephus and the Rabbis, and our translators have adopted it in the margin - a proceeding which, as their preface shows, may frequently be held to imply that in their opinion it is the preferable interpretation. It is energetically impugned by Keil, who maintains that there are insuperable difficulties in the way of this arrangement. He does not, however, make out a very powerful case against the simple explanation of Cornelius a Lapide, that the spies left the camp on the 3rd Nisan, returned on the 6th, that Joshua gave his order on the 7th, and that on the 10th (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>) the crossing was effected. Stripped of all verbiage, Keil's argument appears to amount simply to this, that it was not likely that the account of the narrative would be thus interrupted by an account of a transaction out of its proper chronological order. It may be added that it seems doubtful whether we must not render the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> in ver. 12, by the pluperfect, for it seems very probable that the word of command to the two tribes and a half who had obtained their inheritance beyond Jordan had been given before this, and that therefore it may have preceded the command given to the spies, in which case one of Keil's chief objections fails to the ground. Other explanations than that of Cornelius a Lapide have been suggested. Thus Kimchi supposes that the spies left on the 5th Nisan and returned on the 8th; while Masius supposes that they were sent out simultaneously with these orders. Augustine's explanation, that Joshua did not speak by revelation, but was influenced by human hope, is noticeable, as proving that the early fathers did not always take the strictest view of inspiration. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The boundaries of the land are given as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>, with the simple difference in form, that the boundary line from the desert (of Arabia) and Lebanon, i.e., from the southern and northern extremity, is drawn first of all towards the east to the great river, the Euphrates, and then towards the west to "the great sea, toward the going down of the sun," i.e., the Mediterranean; and then between these two termini ad quem the more precise definition is inserted, "all the land of the Hittites;" whereas in Deuteronomy the southern, northern, and eastern boundaries are placed in antithesis to the western boundary, and the more precise definition of the country to be taken is given by an enumeration of the different tribes that were to be destroyed by the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-23.htm">Deuteronomy 11:23</a>). On the oratorical character of these descriptions, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>. The demonstrative pronoun "this," in connection with Lebanon, may be explained from the fact that Lebanon, or at all events Anti-libanus, was visible from the Israelitish camp. The expression "the Hittites" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>) is used here in a broader sense for Canaanites in general, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>.
