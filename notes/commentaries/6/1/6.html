He is charged to meditate therein day and night, that he might understand it. Whatever affairs of this world we have to mind, we must not neglect the one thing needful. All his orders to the people, and his judgments, must be according to the law of God. Joshua must himself be under command; no man's dignity or dominion sets him above the law of God. He is to encourage himself with the promise and presence of God. Let not the sense of thine own infirmities dishearten thee; God is all-sufficient. I have commanded, called, and commissioned thee to do it, and will be sure to bear thee out in it. When we are in the way of duty, we have reason to be strong and very bold. Our Lord Jesus, as Joshua here, was borne up under his sufferings by a regard to the will of God, and the commandment from his Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lebanon is spoken of as "this Lebanon," because visible from the neighborhood in which Israel was encamped. (Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8-9</a>.) "The wilderness" of the text is the Desert of Arabia, which forms the southern, as Lebanon does the northern, limit of the promised land. The boundaries on the east and west are likewise indicated; and the intervening territory is described generally as "all the land of the Hittites." The Hittites are properly the inhabitants of northern Canaan and Phoenicia (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a> note), but the name appears to be used here for the Canaanites in general, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>. On the boundaries of the promised land compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-9. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee&#8212;Canaan was theirs by a divine grant; and the renewed confirmation of that grant to Joshua when about to lead the people into it, intimated not only a certain but an easy conquest. It is remarkable, however, that his courage and hope of victory were made to depend (see on [171]De 17:18) on his firm and inflexible adherence to the law of God, not only that regarding the extirpation of the Canaanites, but the whole divine code.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Joshua, though a person of great courage and resolution, whereof he had given sufficient proof, yet needs these exhortations, partly because his work was great, and difficult, and long, and in a great measure new; partly because he had a very mean opinion of himself, especially if compared with Moses; and remembering how perverse and ungovernable that people were, even under Moses, he might very well suspect the burden of ruling them would be too heavy for his shoulders. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou shalt divide the land; </span> which supposeth the full conquest of the land.

The same exhortation Moses gave him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>; and is afterwards repeated in this chapter, as being of great moment and importance, as it is in the general of an army to show greatness and strength of mind, valour and courage, and not be dismayed at the number and strength of the enemy. As Joshua's work in fighting with the Canaanites, and conquering their land, so Christ's work in the redemption of his people, and subduing their enemies, required strength and courage, and both were very eminent in him: <p>for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them; and, this promise included and ensured the conquest of it, and the putting the people into the possession of it; for if he was to divide it to them, he must first take it out of the hands of the present inhabitants, and deliver it into the hands of the children of Israel, to be possessed by them, dividing to each tribe and family their part and portion. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be strong and of a good courage.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">be strong and vigorous.</span> The word does not refer so much to the <span class="accented">character</span> of Joshua as to his actions.

And the people obeyed him; but he was not like Moses. "There arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face," i.e., so far as the miracles and signs were concerned which Moses did, by virtue of his divine mission, upon Pharaoh, his servants, and his land, and the terrible acts which he performed before the eyes of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-11.htm">Deuteronomy 34:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-12.htm">Deuteronomy 34:12</a>; vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-8.htm">Deuteronomy 26:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>). "Whom Jehovah knew:" not who knew Him, the Lord. "To know," like &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>, relates to the divine knowledge, which not only involves a careful observance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>), but is also a manifestation of Himself to man, a penetration of man with the spiritual power of God. Because he was thus known by the Lord, Moses was able to perform signs and wonders, and mighty, terrible acts, such as no other performed either before or after him. In this respect Joshua stood far below Moses, and no prophet arose in Israel like unto Moses. - This remark concerning Moses does not presuppose that a long series of prophets had already risen up since the time of Moses. When Joshua had defeated the Canaanites, and conquered their land with the powerful help of the Lord, which was still manifested in signs and wonders, and had divided it among the children of Israel, and when the tribes had settled down in their inheritance, so that the different portions of the land began to be called by the names of Naphtali, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Judah, as is the case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-2.htm">Deuteronomy 34:2</a>; the conviction might already have become established in Israel, that no other prophet would arise like Moses, to whom the Lord had manifested Himself with such signs and wonders before the Egyptians and the eyes of Israel. The position occupied by Joshua in relation to this his predecessor, as the continuer of his work, would necessarily awaken and confirm this conviction, in connection with what the Lord had said as to the superiority of Moses to all the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>.). Moses was the founder and mediator of the old covenant. As long as this covenant was to last, no prophet could arise in Israel like unto Moses. There is but One who is worthy of greater honour than Moses, namely, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, who is placed as the Son over all the house of God, in which Moses was found faithful as a servant (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2-6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), Jesus Christ, the founder and mediator of the new and everlasting covenant.</body></html>
