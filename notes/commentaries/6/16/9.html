This fact would manifestly tend to produce a <span class= "ital">solidarity </span>among the several tribes, and to prevent disunion by creating common interests. The interest of the stronger tribes would be served by completing the conquest of the territory assigned to the weaker. And the general formation thus produced would resemble that which was known by the name of the <span class= "ital">testudo, </span>or tortoise, in Roman warfare. When a body of soldiers approached the wall of a town which it was intended to assault, they sometimes held their shields over them, overlapping like scales, each man’s shield partly sheltering his own, and partly his neighbour’s body, so that no missile could penetrate. Thus it may be said not only of Jerusalem, but of all the tribes in the land of their possession, that they were built as a city that is compact together, and at unity in itself: united by joints and bands, so that if one member of the body politic should suffer, all the members must suffer with it. For a further illustration of the same topic, see on the inheritance of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-11.htm" title="And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.">Joshua 18:11</a>) and of Simeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm" title="And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.">Joshua 19:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-9.htm" title="And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.">Joshua 16:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">The separate cities — </span>That is, besides those cities which were within Ephraim’s bounds, he had some other cities out of Manasseh’s portion, because his tribe was all here, and was larger than Manasseh’s.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:20-63 Here is a list of the cities of Judah.

The reasons for granting these additional cities to the Ephraimites can only be conjectured. Perhaps the territory assigned to this numerous tribe proved on experiment to be too small; and therefore some towns, which are named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-29.htm">1 Chronicles 7:29</a>, were given to them from the kindred Manassites, the latter being recompensed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a> note) at the expense of Issachar and Asher. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of Manasseh&#8212;(Jos 17:9), because it was found that the tract allotted to Ephraim was too small in proportion to its population and power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The separate cities, </span> i.e. besides those cities which were within Ephraim’s bounds, he had some other cities, to which all their territories were annexed out of Manasseh’s portion, because his tribe was all here, and was larger than Manasseh’s. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim,....

The author intended us to add to “the inheritance of the children of Ephraim” the “separate” or “single” cities allotted to the tribe within the borders of Manasseh. It is supposed that after their relative boundaries had been fixed—though the subdivision of the territory assigned to the two brother tribes does not seem to have been very definite—it was found that the territory of Ephraim was too small in proportion to its strength.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - And the separate cities. Literally, <span class="accented">and the cities divided off.</span> The word "were," in our version, is misplaced. It should be read thus: "And there were cities divided off and assigned to the tribe of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh" (see note on ver. 5). This fact, together with the compensation given to Manasseh, may serve to explain the cohesion of the ten tribes in opposition to Judah. The boundaries of the latter tribe were more strictly defined, her attitude more exclusive. We may almost discern this in the prominence given to Judah in the present book. Ephraim, already enraged at the passing away of the pre-eminence from itself, which had not merely been predicted, but, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1-3</a> and Judges 12:1 show, had been actually enjoyed, was closely allied to Manasseh, and Manasseh to Issachar and Zebulun, by the arrangement we are considering. It would naturally be able, by its position and these circumstances, to combine together the rest of the tribe against the somewhat overbearing attitude of the tribe of Judah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From this point "it went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites to the territory of lower Beth-horon," or, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>, "to the mountain (or range) which is on the south by lower Beth-horon." The Japhletite is altogether unknown as the Asherite of this name cannot possibly be thought of (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32-33</a>). Lower Beth-horon is the present Beit-Ur Tachta, a village upon a low ridge. It is separated from Upper Beth-horon, which lies farther east, by a deep wady (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>, and Rob. iii. p. 59).
