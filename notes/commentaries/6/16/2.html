It was the birth-place of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>), and still exists under the ancient name of Beit-lahm, two hours to the south of Jerusalem (Seetzen, ii. pp. 37ff.; Rob. ii. pp. 159ff.; Tobler, Topogr. v.

Bethlehem did not receive the name of Ephratah for the first time from the Calebite family of Ephrathites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-19.htm">1 Chronicles 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>), but was known by that name even in Jacob's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-7.htm">Genesis 48:7</a>). Phagor, which was near to Bethlehem according to the Onom. (s. v. Fogor), and is also called Phaora, is the present Faghur, a heap of ruins to the south-west of Bethlehem (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 275). Aetan was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>), and has been preserved in the Wady and Ain Attan between Bethlehem and Faghur (Tobler, Dritte Wand. pp. 88, 89). Kulon, the present village of Kulomeh, an hour and a half west by north from Jerusalem on the road to Ramleh (see Rob. ii. p. 146; Bibl. Res. p. 158: it is called Kolony by Seetzen, ii. p. 64). Tatam cannot be traced. Sores (for Thobes appears to be only a copyist's error) is probably Saris, a small village four hours to the east of Jerusalem, upon a ridge on the south of Wady Aly (Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 154-5). Karem, now Ain Karim, a large flourishing village two hours to the wets of Jerusalem, with a Franciscan convent dedicated to John the Baptist in the middle, and a fountain (Rob. ii. p. 141; Bibl. Res. p. 271). Galem, a different place from the Gallim on the north of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>), has not yet been discovered. Baither, now a small dirty village called Bettir or Bittir, with a beautiful spring, and with gardens arrange din terraces on the western slope of the Wady Bittir, to the south-west of Jerusalem (Rob.
