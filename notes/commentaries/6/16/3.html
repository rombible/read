But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it.

The first four verses describe the territory allotted to the family of Joseph in the rich domains of central Palestine. It was drawn in one lot, that the brethren might be contiguously situated; but it was afterwards divided.

(1 Maccabees 7)Jerom (c) says in his time it was a village called Gazara, four miles from Nicopolis, or Emmaus. It is the same with Gadara, as it is sometimes called by Josephus, who says (d), the tribe of Ephraim took in the land from the river Jordan to Gadara; this was a royal city; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>, <p>and the outgoings thereof are at the sea: the Mediterranean sea. <p>(c) De loc.
