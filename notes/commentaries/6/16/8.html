But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the abrupt manner in which the statements are introduced, as well as from their imperfect character, there is probability in the conjecture that some words have, in these verses, fallen out of the text.

Tappuah seems to have been near Mich-methah, and on the border (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-8.htm">Joshua 17:8</a>) of Manasseh. According to Knobel, Tappuah signifies <span class="accented">plain</span>, which is a little inconsistent with his idea that Michmethah, close by, was the watershed. Tappuah elsewhere signifies <span class="accented">apple.</span> Unto the river Trench. The winter-bound torrent Kanah, so named from its reeds and canes, formed the border between Ephraim and Manasseh. And the goings out (literally, <span class="accented">extremities</span>) thereof were at the sea This is the only possible interpretation of the passage, in spite of the obscurity caused by the same word being used for "sea" and "west." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And it went out from Bethel to Luz." Bethel is distinguished from Luz in this passage, because the reference is not to the town of Bethel, which was called Luz by the Canaanites (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>), but to the southern range of mountains belonging to Bethel, from which the boundary ran out to the town of Luz, so that this town, which stood upon the border, was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-22.htm">Joshua 18:22</a>). From this point the boundary went over "to the territory of the Arkite to Ataroth," We know nothing further about the Arkite than that David's friend Hushai belonged to that family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-32.htm">2 Samuel 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-16.htm">2 Samuel 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-33.htm">1 Chronicles 27:33</a>). Ataroth, called Ataroth-Adar in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>, was not the present village of Atra, an hour and a half to the south of Jiljilia (Rob. iii. p. 80), as I once supposed, but the ruins of Atra, three-quarters of an hour to the south of Bireh (Beeroth, Rob. ii. p. 314), with which the expression "descended" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a> perfectly harmonizes. Consequently the boundary was first of all drawn in a south-westerly direction from Beitin to Bireh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>), and then southwards to Atrah.</body></html>
