"And there came out the lot of the children of Joseph from Jordan by Jericho." "The lot came out," viz., from the turn (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-17.htm">Joshua 19:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24</a>). The expression "came up" is used in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11</a>. The connection of these two words with the rest of the sentence, "from Jordan by Jericho," may be explained on the supposition that the lot which came out of the urn determined the inheritance that fell to the tribe, so that we might paraphrase the verse in this manner: "There came out the lot to the children of Joseph, namely, the inheritance, which goes out from, or whose boundary commences at, the Jordan by Jericho," i.e., from that part of the Jordan which is opposite to Jericho, and which is still more precisely defined by the additional clause, "by the water of Jericho eastward." The water of Jericho is the present fountain of es Sultan, half an hour to the north-west of Riha, the only large fountain in the neighbourhood of Jericho, whose waters spread over the plain, and form a small brook, which no doubt flows in the rainy season through the Wady Kelt into the Jordan (see Rob. ii. pp. 283-4; Tobler, Topogr. v. Jerus. ii. pp. 558-9). "The wilderness" is in opposition to "the lot," so that the sense is, "namely, the desert going up from Jericho to the mountains to Bethel." According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-12.htm">Joshua 18:12</a>, the reference is to the desert of Beth-aven, which was on the east of Bethel, between the Wady Suwar (Tuwar) and Mutyah (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>). Towards the east this desert terminates with the Jebel Kuruntul (Quarantana) on the north-west of Jericho, where it descends precipitously into the valley of the Jordan, or v. v., where it rises out of the Jordan valley. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-12.htm">Joshua 18:12</a>, the same boundary went up by the shoulder of Jericho towards the north, i.e., along the northern range of mountains by Jericho, which cannot be any other than the "conspicuous double height, or rather group of heights," in front of the mountain of Quarantana, at the eastern foot of which lies the fountain of Ain es Sultan (Rob. ii. p. 284). In all probability, therefore, the boundary ran up towards the north-west, from the Sultan fountain to Ain Duk, and thence in a westerly direction across to Abu Seba (along which road Robinson had a frightful desert on his right hand: Pal. ii. p. 310), and then again towards the north-west to Beitin (Bethel), according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>, along the southern shoulder (or side) of Luz, i.e., Bethel.</body></html>
