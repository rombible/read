If Ataroth-addar is rightly identified as <span class= "ital">Ed-Dârieh, </span>and Mickmethah as the plain of <span class= "ital">Mukhnah, </span>then the line from Ataroth-addar and Beth-horon to Michmethah is a line running due north, and separating the territory of Ephraim on the east from that of Dan on the west. The line from Michmethah to Taanath-shiloh (<span class= "ital">Tana, </span>sheet 12) and Janohah (<span class= "ital">Yânûn, </span>south of <span class= "ital">T’ana, </span>sheet 15), and so to Jordan, is a line running from north-west to south-east. The brook Kanah is (roughly) continuous with this line, but in a westerly direction, and leads us towards the sea. We thus obtain for the territory of Ephraim four boundary-lines—viz.: (<span class= "ital">a</span>) the plain of Jordan on the east; (<span class= "ital">b</span>) the line of hills bordering the Shephelah on the west; (<span class= "ital">c</span>) the brook Kanah, and the line passing through Taanath-shiloh and Janohah to Jordan on the north; and (<span class= "ital">d</span>) the north border of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/16-1.htm" title="And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, to the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,">Joshua 16:1-3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/18-12.htm" title="And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.">Joshua 18:12-14</a>) on the south.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-5.htm" title="And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, to Bethhoron the upper;">Joshua 16:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">East side — </span>That is, the north-east side.

The border of Joseph is very slightly traced out by the historian. It is difficult to give a reason for this fact, when we remember that Joseph, consisting as it did of the preponderating tribe of Ephraim, together with half the tribe of Manasseh, constituted by far the most important portion of Jewish territory. See, however, Introduction for the bearing of this fact on the authorship of the book. It is by no means easy to define the boundaries of the tribes; but, with the utmost deference to the authority of one so long engaged in the actual survey of the Holy Land as Mr. Conder, I feel unable to accept the maps he has given us in his 'Handbook' as an accurate account of them. Sometimes, perhaps, an eager attempt at the identification of certain places may lead astray those who are most familiar with their subject. But there are certain plain statements of the Book of Joshua which cannot be lightly set aside. Thus the extremity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>) of the border of Ephraim is distinctly stated in ver. 8 to be the sea. To translate "westward" would rob the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> of all meaning, even if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> had not the article. Thus Dan can only have approached towards Joppa, but cannot have reached it. And it will be observed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>, in accordance with this view, that the outgoings of the Danite border are not said to have been the sea. Next, it would seem that the Ataroth of ver. 2 (not of ver. 7) and Ataroth-addar are either the same place or close together, and that the present verse gives a small portion of the southeastern boundary as far as Beth-horon. Why the boundary is not traced out further ("the author only gives the western part of the southern border, and leaves out the eastern," Knobel) we cannot tell, but the natural translation of ver. 6 is, "and the western border ran to Michmethah on the north" (so Knobel). There was so small a portion of Ephraim on the sea that the line of the Wady Kanah in a northeasterly direction to Michmethah, near Shechem, might be called a western, as it certainly was a northwestern, border. Then the border deflected (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>) and ran in a southwesterly direction to Jericho. Manasseh seems to have been bounded by Asher on the north and Issachar on the east, from the borders of Asher to Michmethah, and its western boundary the sea from the Wady Kanah to the neighbourhood of Dor. It seems impossible, with the distinct statement that Dor was in Asher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>) - it could hardly have been in Issachar - and that Carmel was part of its western border (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-26.htm">Joshua 19:26</a>), to thrust a wedge of Zehulun between Manasseh and Asher, as Mr. Conder has done. The invention of an Asherham-Michmethah must not be allowed to set aside the plain statement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a>) that Manasseh impinged (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5e2;</span>) upon Asher in a northerly direction - that is, was bounded on the north by that tribe. Then, as Asher was the northern, so it would seem from the passage just cited that Issachar was, as has been suggested, the eastern boundary, and that Issachar was bounded by the Jordan eastward, Manasseh westward, and by Ephraim to the southwest, and some distance further south than is usually supposed. Yet <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a> must not he forgotten in fixing the boundary of Issachar (see note on Joshua 19:17-23). Its northern border, comprehending Jezreel, and bounded by Tabor, was thrust in between Zebulun and Naphtali. Tabor was evidently the border of these three tribes. It is with much diffidence that I venture to offer these suggestions, but they appear to have the sanction of the plain statements of the sacred writer. It would seem as though the comparative smallness of the territory assigned to Joseph led to the cession of some of the towns northward of the Wady Kanah by Manasseh to Ephraim, Manasseh receiving compensation by receiving Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo from Issachar and Asher. The possession of Beth-shean by Manasseh may be due to the fact that the boundary of Manasseh ran along the chain of mountains bordering the great plain of Esdraelon, until it almost reached the Jordan. Additional reasons for entertaining these opinions will be given in the following notes. <span class="cmt_word">On the east side was Ataroth-addar.</span> It is hardly possible to avoid the conclusion that a passage has been omitted here by the transcriber. If so, it must have been at a very early period, since the LXX. shows no sign of it, save that some copies add "and Gezer." But this is probably added from ver. 3, and is in no sense an <span class="accented">eastern</span> border. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nibsan, also unknown.
