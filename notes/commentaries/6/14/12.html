Those who live by faith value that which is given by God's promise, far above what is given by his providence only. It was now in the Anakims' possession, and Caleb would let Israel know how little he feared the enemy, and that he would encourage them to push on their conquests. Caleb answered to his name, which signifies all heart. Hebron was settled on Caleb and his heirs, because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. Happy are we if we follow him.

Thence, they had, as must be inferred from the text here, returned and reoccupied Hebron, probably when Joshua and the main force of the Israelites had marched northward to deal with Jabin and his confederates.

The mountainous part of the country, the hill country of Judea, in which Hebron, Debir, and other cities were; for it was not one particular city only that Caleb requested, but a large tract of ground: <p>for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced; that the giants, called Anakims, dwelt in the mountainous country, and their cities, Hebron, Debir, and Anab, were very large, and well fortified; this Joshua heard at the time the spies were sent into the land, he being one of them; and this he heard, not from the report of the spies, but from the people of the country, and therefore must know that to conquer these men, and subdue their cities, was an arduous undertaking; but since he had strength and courage, he hoped his request would be granted: <p>if so be the Lord will be with me; which he spake not as doubting of his presence and power to be with him, and assist him, but as placing his confidence therein, and, distrusting his own power and ability, having no dependence or that, but believing that the Lord, or, as the Targum, the Word of the Lord, would be with him for his help: <p>then, says Caleb: <p>I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said; that is, to drive the Anakims out of their cities, or out of the mountains, the caves and dens there, to which they betook themselves, since the taking of Hebron, Debir, and Anab, by Joshua, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a>; and he relied upon the promise of God to enable him to do this, and not upon his natural strength and courage, or the number and prowess of the warlike tribe of Judah, of which he was prince. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims <i>were</i> there, and <i>that</i> the cities <i>were</i> great <i>and</i> fenced: <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> if so be the LORD <i>will be</i> with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.</span><p>(e) This he spoke out of modesty, and not from doubting.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">this mountain</span>] i.e. the mountain of Hebron. “The great elevation of this country above the level of the sea is most forcibly brought out by the journey we have made. From the moment of leaving the ’Arabah has been almost a continual ascent. We mounted the great Pass of Sâfeh, and, having mounted, hardly descended at all—crossed the great tableland of Beersheba—and then mounted the barrier of the hills of Judah—and thence have been mounting ever since.

In one of the hollows in this "hill country of Judaea" Hebron still nestles, but at a height which (see Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 102) is "only 400 feet lower than Helvellyn," the highest point but one in England. The Dean remarks on the fact that Palestine was a mountainous country, and that therefore in its history we may expect the characteristics of a mountain people. <span class="cmt_word">Whereof the Lord spake in that day.</span> There must therefore have been a promise made to Caleb, regarding which the Pentateuch, having to deal with matters of more general interest, is silent, that he should lead the forlorn hope, as it were, of the children of Israel, and that the task of subduing the mountain fastnesses of the most powerful tribes in Palestine should be assigned to him. That the original inhabitants reoccupied the districts round Hebron, while the Israelites were otherwise engaged, we have already seen (see note on Joshua 11:21). The final work was to be carried out by Caleb. Houbigant, it is true, thinks that here the same incident is referred to as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21, 22</a>, and that Joshua is there credited with what was clone by Caleb at his command. But we read that that expedition followed close upon the battle of Merom, whereas seven years elapsed before the final expulsion of the Anakim by Caleb. It is important to notice that the author of the Book of Joshua has access to sources of information beside the Pentateuch. This, though not sufficient to disprove, does at least seem inconsistent with the "Elohist" and "Jehovist" theory. <span class="cmt_word">For thou heartiest in that day.</span> The LXX. and Vulgate avoid the difficulty here by referring these words to what goes before - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the promise made to Caleb. In that case we must render the second <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> "for," instead of "that," or "how." Joshua can hardly have heard for the first time that the Anakim were in Hebron if, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a> appears to assert, he, in common with the other spies, had visited the place. But it is possible, though the narrative as it stands seems to suggest that they went together, that the spies went different ways, either separately or in pairs, and that Caleb visited Hebron, and that Joshua heard the account of it for the first time from Caleb's lips, as they brought their report to Moses, and that Caleb then asked and received the grant of Hebron. We may observe the minute agreement here in matters of detail between the Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua. The Pentateuch states that the spies visited Hebron. The Book of Joshua, without mentioning this, makes Caleb appeal to Joshua as a witness that a premise had been made to him, long before the entrance of Israel into the promised land, that this particular place should be allotted to him. The description of Hebron also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>. agrees in every respect with what is stated here. <span class="cmt_word">Fenced</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">inaccessible</span>, as surrounded by walls. <span class="cmt_word">If so be.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">perhaps.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Caleb's Inheritance. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>. Before the casting of the lots commenced, Caleb came to Joshua along with the sons of Judah, and asked for the mountains of Hebron for his possession, appealing at the same time to the fact, that forty-five years before Moses had promised it to him on oath, because he had not discouraged the people and stirred them up to rebellion, as the other spies that were sent from Kadesh to Canaan had done, but had faithfully followed the Lord.<p>(Note: The grounds upon which Knobel follows Maurer and others in affirming that this account does not belong to the so-called Elohist, but is merely a fragment taken from the first document of the Jehovist, are formed partly from misinterpretations of particular verses and partly from baseless assumptions. To the former belongs the assertion, that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-8.htm">Joshua 14:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>, Joshua was not one of the spies (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-8.htm">Joshua 14:8</a>); to the latter the assertion, that the Elohist does not represent Joshua as dividing the land, or Caleb as receiving so large a territory (see on the contrary, however, the exposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13</a>), as well as the enumeration of all kinds of words which are said to be foreign to the Elohistic document.)<p>This occurred at Gilgal, where the casting of the lots as to take place. Caleb was not "the head of the Judahites," as Knobel maintains, but simply the head of a father's house of Judah, and, as we may infer from his surname, "the Kenizzite" or descendant of Kenaz ("the Kenizzite" here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-12.htm">Numbers 32:12</a> is equivalent to "son of Kenaz," <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>), head of the father's house which sprang from Kenaz, i.e., of a subdivision of the Judahite family of Hezron; for Caleb, the brother of Jerahmeel and father of Achzah, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-49.htm">1 Chronicles 2:49</a>), was the same person as Caleb the descendant of Hezron mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a>. From the surname "the Kenizzite" we are of course not to understand that Caleb or his father Jephunneh is described as a descendant of the Canaanitish tribe of Kenizzites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>); but Kenaz was a descendant of Hezron, the son of Perez and grandson of Judah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-5.htm">1 Chronicles 2:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-25.htm">1 Chronicles 2:25</a>), of whom nothing further is known. Consequently it was not the name of a tribe, but of a person, and, as we may see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-15.htm">1 Chronicles 4:15</a>, where one of the sons of Caleb is called Kenaz, the name was repeated in the family. The sons of Judah who came to Joshua along with Caleb were not the Judahites generally, therefore, or representatives of all the families of Judah, but simply members or representatives of the father's house of Judah which took its name from Kenaz, and of which Caleb was the head at that time. Caleb reminded Joshua of the word which the Lord had spoken concerning them in Kadesh-barnea, i.e., the promise of God that they should both of them enter the land of Canaan (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>), and then proceeded to observe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-7.htm">Joshua 14:7</a>): "When I was forty years old, and was sent by Moses as a spy to Canaan, I brought back an answer as it was in my mind," i.e., according to the best of my convictions, without fear of man or regard to the favour of the people. </body></html>
