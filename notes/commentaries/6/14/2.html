Of Ephraim and Manasseh, Jacob had said to Joseph, “as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine:” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> though grandsons, they shall count as sons of Jacob, and each one shall be the head of a tribe. Thus there are two ways of counting Jacob’s sons, each making twelve; and these two seem to be recognised as distinct in Exodus 28. There we are told that the high priest should bear the names of the children of Israel on his shoulders <span class= "ital">according to their birth </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Joseph being counted as well as Levi, but not Ephraim and Manasseh). On his breastplate he must have them <span class= "ital">according to the twelve tribes </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Ephraim and Manasseh being specified, but Joseph and Levi left out).

By this means were prevented the false interpretations which might have been given to the words of Jacob and Moses; and by striking at the root of whatever might occasion jealousies and disputes among the tribes, he evidently secured the honesty of those who were to be appointed to distribute to them the conquered countries in the land of Canaan. Besides, the success of this method became a fresh proof of the divinity of the Israelites’ religion, and the truth of its oracles. Each tribe, finding itself placed by lot exactly in the spot which Jacob and Moses had foretold, it was evident that providence had equally directed both those predictions and that lot. The event justified the truth of the promises. The more singular it was, the more clearly do we discern the finger of God in it. No one has set these reflections in a fairer light than Masius. ‘The portion,’ says he, ‘fell to each tribe just as Jacob had declared two hundred and fifty years before, in the last moments of his life, and Moses, immediately before his death; for to the tribe of Judah fell a country abounding in vineyards and pastures; to Zebulun and Issachar, seaports; in that of Asher was plenty of oil, wheat, and metals; that of Benjamin, near the temple, was in a manner <span class="ital">between the shoulders </span>of the Deity; Ephraim and Manasseh were distinguished with a territory blessed in a peculiar manner by Heaven. The land of Simeon extended from the west to the south of the tribe of Judah. Since, therefore, the lot corresponded so well to these predictions, would it not be insolence and stupidity in the highest degree, not to acknowledge the inspiration of God in the words of Jacob and Moses, the direction of his hand in the lot, and his providence in the went?’”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-5 The Israelites must occupy the new conquests.

Is it not better that our place, as to earthly good or sorrow, should be determined by the infinite wisdom of our heavenly Father, than by our own ignorance?

Perhaps two urns were employed, one containing a description of the several districts to be allotted, the other the names of the tribes; and the portion of each tribe would then be determined by a simultaneous drawing from the two urns. Or a drawing might be made by some appointed person, or by a delegate of each tribe from one urn containing the description of the ten inheritances. The lot only determined in a general way the position in the country of the particular tribe concerned, whether north or south, etc.; the dimensions of each territory being left to be adjusted subsequently, according to the numbers and wants of the tribe to be provided for. Since the predilections and habits of two tribes and a half were consulted in the apportionment to them of the trans-Jordanic territory <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a> there is no objection to the supposition that something of the same kind may have taken place, subject to the divine approval, in the distribution of the lands to the nine and a half other tribes; and the lot would thus be appealed to as finally deciding the matter and foreclosing jealousies and disputes.<p>It is apparent that the casting of the ten lots did not take place simultaneously. The tribe of Judah had precedence, whether by express appointment or because its lot "came up" first, does not appear. It was, as it seems, only after this tribe had settled upon its domains, that further lots were drawn for Ephraim and the half tribe of Manasseh. After this a pause, perhaps of some duration, appears to have occurred; the camp was moved from Gilgal to Shiloh; and the further casting of lots for the other seven tribes was proceeded with at the instigation of Joshua (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 14<p>Jos 14:1-5.

It was also made by lot in presence of a select number of superintendents, appointed according to divine directions given to Moses (see on [192]Nu 34:16). In everything pertaining to civil government, and even the division of the land, Joshua was the acknowledged chief. But in a matter to be determined by lot, a solemn appeal was made to God, and hence Eleazar, as high priest, is named before Joshua.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This course God ordained, partly to prevent discontents, enmities, animosities, and quarrels among the tribes about the quality of their several portions; and partly to demonstrate the truth and wisdom of his providence, by which alone those parts fell to each of them, which Jacob long since, and Moses lately, foretold; so that, as a learned man saith, He must be more stupid than stupidity, and more impudent than impudence itself, that doth not acknowledge and confess a Divine hand and providence in this matter.

Every tribe had its part and portion assigned to it, by the casting of lots; which was done to prevent any future quarrels, animosities and strifes among the tribes, the disposition being of the Lord; and to show the exact agreement between the lot and the divine predictions by Jacob and Moses; and to make it appear that the division of the land was not owing to the private combination of the above men, and their private settlement of it; but to the providence of God, the directors of the lot; their chief business was to see that the lot was executed in a faithful manner, and that every tribe had its allotment according to it. In this Canaan was a type of the heavenly inheritance, which the saints obtain by lot, in and through Christ, the antitypical Joshua, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, <p>as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>, <p>for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7</a>; the reason why this number of them is particularly mentioned follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">By lot was their inheritance</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-55.htm" title="Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.">Numbers 26:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm" title="And you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.">Numbers 33:54</a>, and note above on the use of “lots” ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-18.htm" title="And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.">Joshua 7:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">The use of lots</span> was specially characteristic of the ancient world. Thus it was a standing custom of the Athenians to divide the land of conquered enemies to colonists by lot (Diod. xv. 23, 29), and we find it resorted to by them (<span class="ital">a</span>) in Eubœa (Herod. v. 77; vi. 100), (<span class="ital">b</span>) in Lesbos (Thuc. III. 50). The Romans also assigned territory to the victorious legions by lot (Cic. <span class="ital">Ep. ad Div</span>. xi. 20).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">How the lot was taken</span> on this occasion we are not told. The Rabbins conjecture that there were two urns; in one had been placed little tablets with the names of the tribes, and in the other similar tablets with the names of the districts, and that one of each was drawn at the same time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">The decision</span> was made by lot, not merely to prevent all disputes with reference to their respective possessions, and to remove every ground of discontent and complaint, but also in order that each tribe might cheerfully and thankfully accept the share awarded to it, as the inheritance intended for it by God. “For the casting of lots is not regulated either by the opinion, or caprice, or authority of men.” (Calvin.) “It is true that it seems as though this might have been as easily accomplished, if Joshua or the High Priest had been divinely inspired to give to every tribe its inheritance. But men are never so ready to submit cheerfully to the decisions of another man, even though they may be the result of Divine Inspiration, as they are to a decision arrived at by a lot over which the Lord presides, and thus entirely raised above human caprice.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-18.htm" title="The lot causes contentions to cease, and parts between the mighty.">Proverbs 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a>.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By lot was their inheritance.</span> The commentators, following the Rabbis, have amused themselves by speculations <span class="accented">how</span> the lot was taken. The question is of no great practical importance; but no doubt the contrivance was a very primitive one, as the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> a small pebble, used here, seems to imply. What is of more importance is the fact that the distribution of territory was the result of no one's caprice, or ambition, or intrigue. The whole matter was referred to God, and the leader of the Israelitish hosts and the high priest presided over the ceremony. It was a common belief among the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, that the use of the lot was to refer the matter to a Divine decision. So we read in the Proverbs, "The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>; cf. 18:18). It is a strong evidence for the truth of this narrative that we read of no conflicts between the various tribes respecting the division of territory. Jealousies sprung up between the tribes, as the narratives in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8.htm">Judges 8, 9, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>, are sufficient to show. But in no one case was there any complaint of unfairness, any attempt to disturb the territorial arrangement made at the time of the original settlement in Palestine. There can be little doubt that Keil is right in supposing this original division to have been in outline merely. It is obvious from the onward course of the narrative (especially ch. 18.) that no very minute accuracy in detail could possibly have been arrived at. The country was roughly mapped out at first, and the complete adjustment of boundaries was a matter which would naturally be put off until the land were actually in possession. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The territory of the half tribe of Manasseh extended from Mahanaim onwards, and embraced all Bashan, with the sixty Jair towns and the (northern) half of Gilead (see the comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13-15</a>). </body></html>
