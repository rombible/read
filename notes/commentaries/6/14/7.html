The spies were sent from Kadesh-barnea in the second year of the Exodus, about 38½ years before the passage of Jordan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-14.htm" title="And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.">Deuteronomy 2:14</a>). Thus Caleb would be 40+38=78 years old when they crossed the Jordan. He was 85 when they began to divide the country. Therefore the conquest itself must have extended over a period of seven years. It is manifest that the record of the capture of Jericho and Ai, with the two campaigns of Joshua against the southern and northern confederacies, does not give <span class= "ital">all </span>the details of the war.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/14-7.htm" title="Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart....">Joshua 14:7-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">I brought him word, as it was in my heart — </span>I spake my opinion sincerely, without flattery and fear, when the other spies were biassed by their own fears, and the dread of the people, to speak otherwise than in their consciences they believed. <span class="ital">I wholly followed the Lord my God — </span>The Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מלאתי אחרי יהוה</span>, <span class="ital">milleeti acharei Jehovah, </span>is literally, <span class="ital">I filled after the Lord my God, </span>which words, as Dr. Dodd justly observes, “give the idea of a traveller, who, attentive to the following of his guide, so treads in his steps, as to leave hardly any void space between his guide and him, and continually fills up the traces of his feet.” This testimony, God himself had borne to Caleb, and his repeating it here is perfectly consistent with modesty, and was even necessary, as being the ground of his petition and claim.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:6-15 Caleb's request is, Give me this mountain, or Hebron, because it was formerly in God's promise to him, and he would let Israel knows how much he valued the promise. Those who live by faith value that which is given by God's promise, far above what is given by his providence only. It was now in the Anakims' possession, and Caleb would let Israel know how little he feared the enemy, and that he would encourage them to push on their conquests. Caleb answered to his name, which signifies all heart. Hebron was settled on Caleb and his heirs, because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. Happy are we if we follow him.

Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb &#8230; said&#8212;This incident is recorded here because it occurred while the preparations were being made for casting the lots, which, it appears, were begun in Gilgal. The claim of Caleb to the mountains of Hebron as his personal and family possessions was founded on a solemn promise of Moses, forty-five years before (Nu 14:24; De 1:36; Jos 14:10), to give him that land on account of his fidelity. Being one of the nominees appointed to preside over the division of the country, he might have been charged with using his powers as a commissioner to his own advantage, had he urged his request in private; and therefore he took some of his brethren along with him as witness of the justice and propriety of his conduct.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Forty years old was I: see Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-18.htm" title="Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.">Joshua 11:18</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I brought him word again as it was in mine heart; </span> I spake my opinion sincerely, without flattery and fear, when the other spies were biassed by their own fears, and the dread of the people, to speak otherwise than in their consciences they believed, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/13-30.htm" title="And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it....">Numbers 13:30-32</a> 14:36</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land,....
