They build their claim upon a very good foundation; not their own merits or services, but the Divine precept. The maintenance of ministers is not a thing left merely to the will of the people, that they may let them starve if they please; they which preach the gospel should live by the gospel, and should live comfortably.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The non-priestly Kohathites had been diminished by the destruction of Korah and his company <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>.

Among the former the family of Aaron were exclusively appointed to the priesthood, and all the rest were ranked in the common order of Levites. The first lot was drawn by the Kohathites; and the first of theirs again by the priests, to whom thirteen cities were granted, and ten to the rest of the Kohathites (Jos 21:5); thirteen to the Gershonites (Jos 21:6), and twelve to the Merarites (Jos 21:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar,....
