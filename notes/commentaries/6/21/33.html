Every tribe had its share of Levites' cities. Thus did God graciously provide for keeping up religion among them, and that they might have the word in all parts of the land. Yet, blessed be God, we have the gospel more diffused amongst us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>, etc. Of the cities of the Gershonites, for Beesh-terah read (Beeshterah.)

Beeshterah (contracted from Beth-eshterah, the house of Astarte), called Ashtaroth in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-56.htm">1 Chronicles 6:56</a>, may possibly have been the capital of king Og (Ashtaroth-karnaim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>), if not one of the two villages named Astaroth, which are mentioned by Eusebius in the Onom. (s. v. Astharoth-karnaim), and are described by Jerome as duo castella in Batanaea, novem inter se millibus separata inter Adaram et Abilam civitates, though Adara and Abila are too indefinite to determine the situation with any exactness. At any rate, the present Busra on the east of the Hauran cannot be thought of for a moment; for this was called &#x392;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; or &#x392;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, i.e., &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, in ancient times, as it is at the present day (see 1 Macc. 5:26, and Joseph. Ant. xii. 8, 3), and was corrupted into Bostra by the Greeks and Romans. Nor can it be the present Kul'at Bustra on the north of Banyas upon a shoulder of the Hermon, where there are the ruins of a magnificent building, probably a temple of ancient date (Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 93, 94; Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 414-15), as Knobel supposes, since the territory of the Israelites did not reach so far north, the land conquered by Joshua merely extending to Baal-gad, i.e., Banyas, at the foot of the Hermon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>), and the land to the east of the Jordan, or Bashan, only to the Hermon itself, or more correctly, merely to the districts of Geshuri and Maacah at the south-eastern border of the Hermon (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>).</body></html>
