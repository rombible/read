And the promise of the heavenly Canaan is as sure to all God's spiritual Israel; for it is the promise of Him that cannot lie. There stood not a man before them. The after-prevalence of the Canaanites was the effect of Israel's slothfulness, and the punishment of their sinful inclination to the idolatries and abominations of the heathen whom they harboured and indulged. There failed not aught of any good thing, which the Lord had spoken to the house of Israel. In due season all his promises will be accomplished; then will his people acknowledge that the Lord has exceeded their largest expectations, and made them more than conquerors, and brought them to their desired rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is no real inconsistency between the declarations of these verses and the fact that the Israelites had not as yet possessed themselves of all the cities allotted to the various tribes <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21-36</a> - nor did at any time, subdue the whole extent of country promised to them <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-1.htm">Numbers 34:1-12</a>. God had fulfilled all His part of the covenant. It was no part of His purpose that the native population should be annihilated suddenly <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>; but they were delivered into the hand of Israel, and their complete dispossession could have been effected at any time by that divine aid which was never wanting when sought. At the time referred to in the text, the Canaanites were discouraged, broken in strength, holding fast in isolated spots only up and down the land in the very midst of the tribes of God's people. The conquest of Canaan was already "ex parte Dei" a perfect work; just as in the New Testament the triumph of the individual Christian and of the Christian Church in their warfare is often spoken of as accomplished in view of the divine will that it should be so, and of divine grace that it may be so. It was therefore, only the inertness and pusillanimity of the Israelites which prevented the completion of the conquest when the allotment of Canaan was made by Joshua; as it was their subsequent backslidings which caused God to turn the tide of victory against them and even to cast them out of the land promised to their forefathers and actually won in the campaigns of Joshua.

God Gave Them Rest.<p>43-45. the Lord gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers&#8212;This is a general winding up of the history from the thirteenth chapter, which narrates the occupation of the land by the Israelites. All the promises made, whether to the people or to Joshua (Jos 1:5), had been, or were in the course of being fulfilled; and the recorded experience of the Israelites (Jos 21:45), is a ground of hope and confidence to the people of God in every age, that all other promises made to the Church will, in due time, be accomplished.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, all the days of Joshua, by comparing <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-5.htm" title="There shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you: I will not fail you, nor forsake you.">Joshua 1:5</a></span>, for afterwards it was otherwise with them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord gave them rest round about,....

For even though the Canaanites were not all exterminated, yet those who remained did not venture upon an attack on the Israelites so long as they remained loyal and steadfast to their invisible King, and as long as Joshua and his contemporaries lived. “It was no part of the Divine purpose that the native population should be annihilated suddenly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-29.htm" title="I will not drive them out from before you in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against you.">Exodus 23:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm" title="And the LORD your God will put out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase on you.">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>); but they were delivered into the hand of Israel, and their complete dispossession could have been effected at any time by the Divine aid which was never wanting when sought.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Lord delivered all their enemies</span>] See above ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-24.htm" title="And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD has delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.">Joshua 2:24</a>. Hence, though Israel after the death of Joshua became slothful in the work, and never obtained complete possession of the land, never, e.g. conquered Tyre and Sidon, still this was no breach of the Divine promise, for its <span class="ital">complete</span> fulfilment depended upon Israel’s fidelity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord gave them rest.</span> LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The student of Scripture will not fail to recall the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-8.htm">Joshua 4:8</a>) in which reference is made to this passage, and especially to the LXX. version of it. The word signifies rather rest from wandering than rest from toil, though in some passages (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>) it has the latter signification (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Round about.</span> Or, <span class="accented">from</span> round about, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the assaults of the surrounding nations. <span class="cmt_word">According to all that he sware</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There stood not a man of all their enemies before them</span>. This was true, as far as the present history is concerned. We read that the Ephraimites did not, or "could not," drive out their enemies, and that the other tribes also failed to obtain complete possession of the land. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we are not told that this was in the time of Joshua, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is intimated that this was their own fault. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How could it be otherwise? Had the same faith been theirs which caused the Jordan to dry up, and the towers of Jericho to fall down at their march, which discomfited one vast confederacy at Beth-horon, and annihilated another vast confederacy, even better supplied with munitions of war at Lake Merom, they could not have failed to root out the scanty remnant of their humiliated and disheartened foes. As has already been remarked (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>, note), it was from no neglect on Joshua's part that this was not done at once, for it had been God's own command that it should not be done, lest the country should become a desert (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>). Calvin concludes a similar argument with the words, "nothing but their own cowardice prevented them from enjoying the blessings of God in all their fulness." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From Gad they received four towns: Ramoth in Gilead, and Mahanaim (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), Heshbon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>) and Jaezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a> : see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-32.htm">Numbers 21:32</a>).</body></html>
