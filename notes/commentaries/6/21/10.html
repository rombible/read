Every tribe had its share of Levites' cities. Thus did God graciously provide for keeping up religion among them, and that they might have the word in all parts of the land.

The tribe of Levi was divided into three branches, - The Gershonites, the Kohathites, and the Merarites (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16-19</a>). The Kohathites again were divided into the four families of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>); and the family of Amram into two lines, consisting of the descendants of Moses and Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>). The priesthood was committed to the line of Aaron (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1-7</a>); but the other descendants of Amram, i.e., the descendants of Moses, were placed on a par with the other descendants of Levi, and numbered among the simple Levites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1-7</a>). The towns in which the different families of Levi were to dwell were determined by lot; but in all probability the towns which each tribe was to give up to them were selected first of all, so that the lot merely decided to which branch of the Levites each particular town was to belong.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-4.htm">Joshua 21:4</a><p>The first lot came out for the families of Kohath, and among these again for the sons of Aaron, i.e., the priests. They received thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. "This did not happen by chance; but God, according to His wonderful counsel, placed them just in that situation which He had determined to select for His own temple" (Calvin).</body></html>
