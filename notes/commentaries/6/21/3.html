Bahr ('Symbolik des Alten Testaments,' 1:221) remarks on the symbolical meaning of this number. He compares it, first, to the twelve tribes marching in four detachments, the ark of God and its guard in the centre (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.). Four, he says, is the number of the world, and three the sign of God, and twelve of the combination of the two. Thus we are reminded of the heavenly city which "lieth four-square," which has "twelve foundations of precious stones," "twelve gates of pearls, and at the gates twelve angels," and the names of "the twelve tribes of Israel" written thereupon, and wherein was "the tree of life," with its "twelve manner of fruits," which were "yielded every month" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12, 14, 16, 19, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the distribution of the land by lot among the tribes of Israel, six towns were set apart, in accordance with the Mosaic instructions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>, as places of refuge for unintentional manslayers.
