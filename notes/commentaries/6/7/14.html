The parallel passage—viz., the selection of King Saul from the tribes of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-20.htm" title="And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.">1Samuel 10:20-21</a>)—shows that the oracle of God was consulted. “They inquired,” and “the Lord answered.” So it was, perhaps, in the case of Achan. We seem to see the High Priest of Israel “asking counsel for Joshua after the judgment of Urim before the Lord,” as it had been foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a>; and the elders of Israel standing by, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. The representatives of the tribes enter the sacred enclosure in succession, and pass before the High Priest, in awful silence, broken only by the voice of Jehovah, who pronounces it intervals the names of <span class= "ital">Judah, Zarhite, Zabdi, Carmi, Achan. </span>It must have been a terrible ordeal. But all present must have felt that no human partiality, or private animosity, was seeking its victim. The Judge of all the earth was doing judgment. And when the accusation of Jehovah was followed by the explicit confession of the criminal, and this again by the discovery of the stolen spoil of Jericho, which was brought in by the messengers, and “poured out before the Lord,” and when this discovery was followed by the execution of the awful sentence, all who were present must have received a lesson, which it was impossible to forget, as to the reality of the covenant of God. And if, as seems most probable, the voice of the oracle was uttered from the inner sanctuary, from between the cherubim, but “heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God, when He speaketh” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm" title="And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.">Ezekiel 10:5</a>), we learn once more the majesty of the law given to Israel. The arrest of Jordan, the overthrow of Jericho, and the discovery of Achan, are all manifestations of power proceeding from the same source.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/7-14.htm" title="In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man....">Joshua 7:14-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">The tribe which the Lord taketh </span>— Which shall be declared guilty by the lot, which is disposed by the Lord, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a>,) and which was to be cast in the Lord’s presence before the ark.

Times of danger and trouble should be times of reformation. We should look at home, into our own hearts, into our own houses, and make diligent search to find out if there be not some accursed thing there, which God sees and abhors; some secret lust, some unlawful gain, some undue withholding from God or from others. We cannot prosper, until the accursed thing be destroyed out of our hearts, and put out of our habitations and our families, and forsaken in our lives. When the sin of sinners finds them out, God is to be acknowledged. With a certain and unerring judgment, the righteous God does and will distinguish between the innocent and the guilty; so that though the righteous are of the same tribe, and family, and household with the wicked, yet they never shall be treated as the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord taketh - i. e. by lot. The Hebrew word for lot suggests that small stones, probably white and black ones, were used. These were probably drawn from a chest (compare the expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>). The lot was regarded as directed in its result by God (margin reference); and hence, was used on many important occasions by the Jews and by other nations in ancient times. For example:<p>(1), for apportionment, as of Canaan among the twelve tribes <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>; of the Levitical cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-4.htm">Joshua 21:4</a> ff); of spoil or captives taken in war <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>.<p>(2) for detection of the guilty, as in the case if Achan, Jonathan <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-42.htm">1 Samuel 14:42</a>, and Jonah Jon 1:7.<p>(3) for determining the persons to undertake a dangerous or warlike enterprise <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a>.<p>(4) for making appointment to important functions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>); or for sharing the duties or privileges of an office among those concerned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>.<p>The casting of lots before Haman <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a> seems to have been with a view of determining the lucky day for his undertaking against the Jews. One passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-18.htm">Proverbs 18:18</a> perhaps points also to the employment of the lot to decide litigation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-15. the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up&#8212;The answer of the divine oracle was to this effect: the crisis is owing not to unfaithfulness in Me, but sin in the people. The conditions of the covenant have been violated by the reservation of spoil from the doomed city; wickedness, emphatically called folly, has been committed in Israel (Ps 14:1), and dissimulation, with other aggravations of the crime, continues to be practised. The people are liable to destruction equally with the accursed nations of Canaan (De 7:26). Means must, without delay, be taken to discover and punish the perpetrator of this trespass that Israel may be released from the ban, and things be restored to their former state of prosperity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which the Lord taketh; </span> which shall be discovered or declared guilty by the lot, which is disposed by the Lord, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a></span>, and which was to be cast in the Lord’s presence before the ark.

According to the families. The gradual centering of the suspicion upon the offender is one of the most striking features of the history. The genealogies of the children of Israel were very strictly kept, as the Books of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah show. Achan's name is carefully given in the genealogy of Judah in 1 Chronicles if. 7. The subdivision of the tribes into families (or <span class="accented">clans</span>, Keil) and households (or, as we should perhaps say, <span class="accented">families</span>) was for convenience of enumeration, military organisation, and perhaps of assessment. Oehler, 'Theologie des Allen Testaments,' Sec. 101, takes the same view as Keil. The tribes, he says, were divided into <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5c3;&#x5da;&#x5c3;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, Geschlechter (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, for which the best English equivalent is <span class="accented">clans</span>, as above); these into families or houses (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), or fathers' hours (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>); and these again into single heads of a house (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The principle, he adds of a Mosaic family, is as follows: Every <span class="accented">"family"</span> forms a distinct whole, which as far as possible must be maintained in its integrity. Each tribe, says Jahn ('Hebrew Commonwealth,' Book II.), acknowledged a prince (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) as its ruler. As its numbers increased, there arose a subdivision of the tribe into collections of families. Such a collection was called a house of fathers, a <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or clan, or a thousand, rut this explanation is not so satisfactory as that given above. Kurz remarks on the important part family life played among the Hebrews, with whom, in consequence of their descent from Abraham, and the importance they attached to it, the nation was developed out of the family.

It was not because he did not know what to say, for he proceeded at once to pour out the thoughts of his heart, but because he felt that the thought which he was about to utter might involve a reproach, as if, when God permitted that disaster, He had not thought of His own honour; and as he could not possibly think this, he introduced his words with a supplicatory inquiry. What he proceeds to say in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-8.htm">Joshua 7:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-9.htm">Joshua 7:9</a>, does not contain two co-ordinate clauses, but one simple thought: how would God uphold His great name before the world, when the report that Israel had turned their back before them should reach the Canaanites, and they should come and surround the Israelites, and destroy them without a single trace from off the face of the earth.<p>(Note: Calovius has therefore given the correct interpretation: "When they have destroyed our name, after Thou hast chosen us to be Thy people, and brought us hither with such great wonders, what will become of Thy name? Our name is of little moment, but wilt Thou consult the honour of Thine own name, if Thou destroyest us? For Thou didst promise us this land; and what people is there that will honour Thy name if ours should be destroyed?")<p>In the words, "the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land," there is involved the thought that there were other people living in Canaan beside the Canaanites, e.g., the Philistines.
