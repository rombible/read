Times of danger and trouble should be times of reformation. We should look at home, into our own hearts, into our own houses, and make diligent search to find out if there be not some accursed thing there, which God sees and abhors; some secret lust, some unlawful gain, some undue withholding from God or from others. We cannot prosper, until the accursed thing be destroyed out of our hearts, and put out of our habitations and our families, and forsaken in our lives. When the sin of sinners finds them out, God is to be acknowledged. With a certain and unerring judgment, the righteous God does and will distinguish between the innocent and the guilty; so that though the righteous are of the same tribe, and family, and household with the wicked, yet they never shall be treated as the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>burnt with fire - i. e. after he had been put to death by stoning <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-15. the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up&#8212;The answer of the divine oracle was to this effect: the crisis is owing not to unfaithfulness in Me, but sin in the people. The conditions of the covenant have been violated by the reservation of spoil from the doomed city; wickedness, emphatically called folly, has been committed in Israel (Ps 14:1), and dissimulation, with other aggravations of the crime, continues to be practised. The people are liable to destruction equally with the accursed nations of Canaan (De 7:26). Means must, without delay, be taken to discover and punish the perpetrator of this trespass that Israel may be released from the ban, and things be restored to their former state of prosperity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Burnt with fire, </span> as persons and things accursed were to be.

THE DISCOVERY OF ACHAN'S SIN. - <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The question which Joshua addresses to God he introduces in this way: "Pray (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; contracted from &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;), Lord, what shall I say?" to modify the boldness of the question which follows. It was not because he did not know what to say, for he proceeded at once to pour out the thoughts of his heart, but because he felt that the thought which he was about to utter might involve a reproach, as if, when God permitted that disaster, He had not thought of His own honour; and as he could not possibly think this, he introduced his words with a supplicatory inquiry. What he proceeds to say in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-8.htm">Joshua 7:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-9.htm">Joshua 7:9</a>, does not contain two co-ordinate clauses, but one simple thought: how would God uphold His great name before the world, when the report that Israel had turned their back before them should reach the Canaanites, and they should come and surround the Israelites, and destroy them without a single trace from off the face of the earth.<p>(Note: Calovius has therefore given the correct interpretation: "When they have destroyed our name, after Thou hast chosen us to be Thy people, and brought us hither with such great wonders, what will become of Thy name? Our name is of little moment, but wilt Thou consult the honour of Thine own name, if Thou destroyest us? For Thou didst promise us this land; and what people is there that will honour Thy name if ours should be destroyed?")<p>In the words, "the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land," there is involved the thought that there were other people living in Canaan beside the Canaanites, e.g., the Philistines. The question, "What wilt Thou do with regard to Thy great name?" signifies, according to the parallel passages, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>, "How wilt Thou preserve Thy great name, which Thou hast acquired thus far in the sight of all nations through the miraculous guidance of Israel, from being misunderstood and blasphemed among the heathen?" ("what wilt Thou do?" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-29.htm">Genesis 26:29</a>). </body></html>
