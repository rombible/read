The righteous God has many ways of bringing to light the hidden works of darkness. See also, how much it is our concern, when God is contending with us, to find out the cause that troubles us. We must pray with holy Job, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. Achan's sin began in the eye. He saw these fine things, as Eve saw the forbidden fruit. See what comes of suffering the heart to walk after the eyes, and what need we have to make this covenant with our eyes, that if they wander they shall be sure to weep for it. It proceeded out of the heart. They that would be kept from sinful actions, must mortify and check in themselves sinful desires, particularly the desire of worldly wealth. Had Achan looked upon these things with an eye of faith, he would have seen they were accursed things, and would have dreaded them; but looking on them with an eye of sense only, he saw them as goodly things, and coveted them. When he had committed the sin, he tried to hide it. As soon as he had got this plunder, it became his burden, and he dared not to use his ill-gotten treasure. So differently do objects of temptation appear at a distance, to what they do when they have been gotten. See the deceitfulness of sin; that which is pleasing in the commission, is bitter in the reflection. See how they will be deceived that rob God. Sin is a very troublesome thing, not only to a sinner himself, but to all about him. The righteous God will certainly recompense tribulation to them that trouble his people. Achan perished not alone in his sin. They lose their own, who grasp at more than their own. His sons and daughters were put to death with him. It is probable that they helped to hide the things; they must have known of them. What fatal consequences follow, even in this world, to the sinner himself, and to all belonging him! One sinner destroys much good. What, then, will be the wrath to come? Let us flee from it to Christ Jesus as the sinner's Friend. There are circumstances in the confession of Achan, marking the progress of sin, from its first entrance into the heart to its being done, which may serve as the history of almost every offence against the law of God, and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sin had been national (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a> note), and accordingly the expiation of it was no less so. The whole nation, no doubt through its usual representatives, took part in executing the sentence. Achan had fallen by his own act under the ban <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18</a>, and consequently he and his were treated as were communities thus devoted <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-15.htm">Deuteronomy 13:15-17</a>. It would appear too that Achan's family must have been accomplices in his sin; for the stolen spoil could hardly have been concealed in his tent without their being privy thereto. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-26. Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan&#8212;He with his children and all his property, cattle as well as movables, were brought into one of the long broad ravines that open into the Ghor, and after being stoned to death (Nu 15:30-35), his corpse, with all belonging to him, was consumed to ashes by fire. "All Israel" was present, not only as spectators, but active agents, as many as possible, in inflicting the punishment&#8212;thus testifying their abhorrence of the sacrilege, and their intense solicitude to regain the divine favor. As the divine law expressly forbade the children to be put to death for their father's sins (De 24:16), the conveyance of Achan's "sons and daughters" to the place of execution might be only as spectators, that they might take warning by the parental fate; or, if they shared his punishment (Jos 22:20), they had probably been accomplices in his crime, and, indeed, he could scarcely have dug a hole within his tent without his family being aware of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Stoned him with stones, </span> and burned him with fire; which is easily understood, both out of the following words, and from God’s command to do so, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm" title="And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has: because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has worked folly in Israel.">Joshua 7:15</a></span>, which doubtless was here executed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> How could both these deaths be inflicted upon them? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> It seems they were stoned to death, which was the punishment of such offenders, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-35.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.">Numbers 15:35</a></span>, and not burned to death; and therefore the stoning only of Achan is mentioned here, and not his burning; and God would have their dead carcasses burned to show his utmost detestation of such persons as break forth into sins of such a public scandal and mischief.

Been the occasion of so much trouble to us, by committing this sin: <p>the Lord shall trouble thee this day; by the destruction of him and all that belonged to him: this is said to show that his punishment was of God, and according to his will: in the Misnah (r) an emphasis is laid on the phrase "this day", and it is observed,"this day thou shalt be troubled, but thou shalt not be troubled in the world to come;''suggesting that though temporal punishment was inflicted on him, yet his iniquity was forgiven, and he would be saved with an everlasting, salvation; and as it may be hoped from the ingenuous confession that he made, that he had true repentance for it, and forgiveness of it: <p>and all Israel stoned him with stones; hence some gather, that only Achan himself suffered death, and not his sons and daughters: <p>and burnt them with fire after they had stoned them with stones; which the Jewish commentators understand of his oxen, asses, and sheep; so Jarchi, Ben Gersom, and Abarbinel: likewise his tent, and household goods, the Babylonish garment, gold and silver, were burnt, and he himself also, for that is the express order, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>; the Jews say, as particularly Jarchi observes, that he was stoned because he profaned the sabbath, it being on the sabbath day that Jericho was taken, and stoning was the punishment of the sabbath breaker, and he was burnt on the account of the accursed thing; so Abendana. <p>(r) Sanhedrin ut supra.

It suggests that it does not necessarily follow that the sons and daughters of Achan were burned with him. In this case “the plural number used would refer only to the oxen, asses, and sheep, and all that Achan possessed.” Edersheim. Stoning was the ordinary mode of execution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-4.htm" title="And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they be almost ready to stone me.">Exodus 17:4</a>), especially for idolatry and blasphemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm" title="And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king.

It has been suggested that the former word signifies to stone a living person, the second to heap up stones upon a dead one; and this derives confirmation from the fact that the former word has the signification of piling up, while the latter rather gives the idea of the weight of the pile. Some have gathered from the use of the singular here, that Achan only was stoned; but the use of the plural immediately afterwards implies the contrary, unless, with Knobel, we have recourse to the suggestion that "them" is a "mistake of the Deuteronomist" for "him." It is of course possible that his family were only taken there to witness the solemn judgment upon their father. But the use of the singular and plural in Hebrew is frequently very indefinite (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>.

It is not ironically, or with dissimulation, that Joshua addresses him as "my son," but with "sincere paternal regard."<p>(Note: To these remarks Calvin also adds: "This example serves as a lesson to judges, that when punishing crimes they should moderate their rigour, and not lose all the feelings of humanity; and, on the other hand, that whilst merciful they should not be careless or remiss.")<p>"Give glory to the Lord:" this is a solemn formula of adjuration, by which a person was summoned to confess the truth before the face of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm">John 9:24</a>). "And give Him praise:" the meaning is not, "make confession," but give praise, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a> clearly shows. Through a confession of the truth Achan was to render to God, as the Omniscient, the praise and honour that were due. </body></html>
