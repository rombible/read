For any other sin but this, Achan must have suffered alone. “The children shall not be put to death for the fathers.” But in this case, warning had been given that the man who took of the accursed thing, or <span class= "ital">ch</span>ê<span class= "ital">rern, </span>would be an accursed thing like it, if he brought it into his house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-26.htm" title="Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>), and would make the camp of Israel <span class= "ital">chêrem </span>also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-18.htm" title="And you, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make yourselves accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.">Joshua 6:18</a>), and thus Achan’s whole establishment was destroyed as though it had become part of Jericho. It is not necessary to assert that the family of Achan were accomplices. His cattle were not so, and yet they were destroyed. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-7.htm" title="And the sons of Carmi; Achar, the troubler of Israel, who transgressed in the thing accursed.">1Chronicles 2:7</a>, where his line is not continued. Observe also the incidental reference to the fact in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-20.htm" title="Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.">Joshua 22:20</a>, “<span class= "ital">That man perished not alone </span>in his iniquity.” The severity of the punishment must be estimated by the relation of Achan’s crime to the whole plan of the conquest of Canaan. If the destruction of the Canaanites was indeed the execution of the Divine vengeance, it must be kept entirely clear of all baser motives, lest men should say that Jehovah gave His people licence to deal with the Canaanites as it seemed best for themselves. The punishment of Saul for taking the spoil of Amalek (1 Samuel 15), and the repeated statement of the Book of Esther that the Jews who stood for their lives and slew their enemies, the supporters of Haman’s project, <span class= "ital">laid not their hands on the prey, </span>are further illustrations of the same principle. The gratification of human passions may not be mingled with the execution of the vengeance of God. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-11.htm" title="Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,">Esther 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-10.htm" title="The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.">Esther 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/esther/9-15.htm" title="For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.">Esther 9:15-16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The valley of Achor.</span>—In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-7.htm" title="And the sons of Carmi; Achar, the troubler of Israel, who transgressed in the thing accursed.">1Chronicles 2:7</a>, Achan himself is designated <span class= "ital">Achar </span>(one among several examples of the alteration of a name to suit some circumstance of a person’s history. Compare Bathsheba for Bathshua, Shallum for Jehoiachin, Ishbosheth for Eshbaal, &c.). There is a double play upon the names in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-15.htm" title="And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.">Hosea 2:15</a> : “I will give her her vineyards (<span class= "ital">Carmêha. </span>Compare <span class= "ital">Carmi, </span>“my vineyard”) from thence, and the valley of trouble (<span class= "ital">Achor</span>) for a door of hope.” The valley of Achor is a pass leading from Gilgal towards the centre of the country, or, as it might be represented, from Jericho towards Jerusalem—i.e., from the city of destruction to the city of God. So it was to Israel in the conquest. The future state of Achan is in the hands of the Judge who “doeth judgment.” No mercy to his crime on earth was possible. It would have been injustice to all mankind.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm" title="And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.">Joshua 7:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">And his sons and his daughters — </span>It is very probable, Achan being an old man, that his children were grown up, and the things which he had stolen being buried in the midst of his tent, it is likely they were conscious of the fact, as the Jewish doctors affirm they were; and if they were not accomplices in his crime, yet, at least, they concealed it. This is said, on the supposition that they were stoned and burned. But, according to the LXX., who say nothing of his children, only <span class="ital">he </span>was put to death. And it is not necessary to understand even the Hebrew text as affirming any thing further. It says, <span class="ital">all Israel stoned him with stones, </span>without mentioning his family. And what it afterward adds, <span class="ital">And burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones, </span>may be understood of <span class="ital">the oxen, and asses, and sheep </span>which belonged to Achan, and which God willed to be destroyed, together with his tent, and other effects, to excite a greater horror of his crime. For the brute creatures, though not capable of sin, nor of punishment, properly so called, yet, as they were made for man’s use, so they may be justly destroyed for man’s good. And as they are daily killed for our bodily food, it surely cannot seem strange that they should sometimes be killed for the instruction of our minds, that we may hereby learn the contagious nature of sin, which involves innocent creatures in its destructive effects.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:16-26 See the folly of those that promise themselves secrecy in sin. The righteous God has many ways of bringing to light the hidden works of darkness. See also, how much it is our concern, when God is contending with us, to find out the cause that troubles us. We must pray with holy Job, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. Achan's sin began in the eye. He saw these fine things, as Eve saw the forbidden fruit. See what comes of suffering the heart to walk after the eyes, and what need we have to make this covenant with our eyes, that if they wander they shall be sure to weep for it. It proceeded out of the heart. They that would be kept from sinful actions, must mortify and check in themselves sinful desires, particularly the desire of worldly wealth. Had Achan looked upon these things with an eye of faith, he would have seen they were accursed things, and would have dreaded them; but looking on them with an eye of sense only, he saw them as goodly things, and coveted them. When he had committed the sin, he tried to hide it. As soon as he had got this plunder, it became his burden, and he dared not to use his ill-gotten treasure. So differently do objects of temptation appear at a distance, to what they do when they have been gotten. See the deceitfulness of sin; that which is pleasing in the commission, is bitter in the reflection. See how they will be deceived that rob God. Sin is a very troublesome thing, not only to a sinner himself, but to all about him. The righteous God will certainly recompense tribulation to them that trouble his people. Achan perished not alone in his sin. They lose their own, who grasp at more than their own. His sons and daughters were put to death with him. It is probable that they helped to hide the things; they must have known of them. What fatal consequences follow, even in this world, to the sinner himself, and to all belonging him! One sinner destroys much good. What, then, will be the wrath to come? Let us flee from it to Christ Jesus as the sinner's Friend. There are circumstances in the confession of Achan, marking the progress of sin, from its first entrance into the heart to its being done, which may serve as the history of almost every offence against the law of God, and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sin had been national (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a> note), and accordingly the expiation of it was no less so. The whole nation, no doubt through its usual representatives, took part in executing the sentence. Achan had fallen by his own act under the ban <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18</a>, and consequently he and his were treated as were communities thus devoted <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-15.htm">Deuteronomy 13:15-17</a>. It would appear too that Achan's family must have been accomplices in his sin; for the stolen spoil could hardly have been concealed in his tent without their being privy thereto. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-26. Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan&#8212;He with his children and all his property, cattle as well as movables, were brought into one of the long broad ravines that open into the Ghor, and after being stoned to death (Nu 15:30-35), his corpse, with all belonging to him, was consumed to ashes by fire. "All Israel" was present, not only as spectators, but active agents, as many as possible, in inflicting the punishment&#8212;thus testifying their abhorrence of the sacrilege, and their intense solicitude to regain the divine favor. As the divine law expressly forbade the children to be put to death for their father's sins (De 24:16), the conveyance of Achan's "sons and daughters" to the place of execution might be only as spectators, that they might take warning by the parental fate; or, if they shared his punishment (Jos 22:20), they had probably been accomplices in his crime, and, indeed, he could scarcely have dug a hole within his tent without his family being aware of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His sons and his daughters; </span> but this seems hard and unjust, and therefore forbidden by God himself, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-16.htm" title="The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.">Deu 24:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 1.

Their death was a debt they owed to nature and to their own sins, which debt God may require when he pleaseth; and he could not take it in more honourable and excellent circumstances than these, that the death of a very few in the beginning of a new empire, and of their settlement in the land might be useful to prevent the death of many thousands, who took warning by this dreadful example, whom, if the fear of God did not, yet the love of their own and of their dear children’s lives would, restrain from such dangerous and pernicious practices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. It is very probable they were conscious of the fact, as the Jewish doctors affirm. If it be pretended that some of them were infants, the text doth not say so, but only calls them <span class="ital">sons</span> and <span class="ital">daughters</span>. And considering that Achan was an old man, as is most probable, because he was the fifth person from Judah, (of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm" title="But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.">Joshua 7:1</a>"</span>,) it seems most likely that the children were grown up, and so capable of knowing, and concealing or discovering this fact. Nor doth it follow that they were not guilty because it is not said so; for it is apparent that many circumstances are omitted in divers historical relations in Scripture, which sometimes are supplied in other places. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His oxen, and his asses, and his sheep</span>; which, though not capable of sin, nor of punishment properly so called, yet, as they were made for man’s use, so they are rightly destroyed for man’s good; and being daily killed for our bodily food, it cannot seem strange to kill them for the instruction of our minds, that hereby we might learn the detestable and contagious nature of sin, which involves innocent creatures in its plagues; and how much sorer punishments are reserved for man, who having a law given to him, and that excellent gift of reason and will to restrain him from the transgressions of it, his guilt must needs be unspeakably greater, and therefore his sufferings more severe and terrible. Further, by this enumeration it appears that he had no colour of necessity to induce him to this fact, but was wholly inexcusable. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,....
