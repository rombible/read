The love of the world is that root of bitterness, which of all others is most hardly rooted up. We should take heed of sin ourselves, lest by it many be defiled or disquieted, Heb 12:15; and take heed of having fellowship with sinners, lest we share their guilt. It concerns us to watch over one another to prevent sin, because others' sins may be to our damage. The easy conquest of Jericho excited contempt of the enemy, and a disposition to expect the Lord to do all for them without their using proper means. Thus men abuse the doctrines of Divine grace, and the promises of God, into excuses for their own sloth and self-indulgence. We are to work out our own salvation, though it is God that works in us. It was a dear victory to the Canaanites, whereby Israel was awakened and reformed, and reconciled to their God, and the people of Canaan hardened to their own ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shebarim - Rather, perhaps, "the stone quarries."

So the Syriac and Chaldee versions. But this is quite out of the question. The Israelites were not annihilated, for they only lost about 36 men. Nor is Shebarim a proper name, as the Vulgate renders it. It has the article, and must be rendered either with Keil, the stone quarries (literally, <span class="accented">the crushings</span> or <span class="accented">breakings</span>), or with Gesenius, <span class="accented">the ruins</span>, which, however, is less probable, since Ai (see above)has a similar signification. Munsterus mentions a view that it was so called in consequence of the slaughter of the Israelites. But this is very improbable. <span class="cmt_word">In the going down.</span> Ai stood in a strong position on the mountains. The margin "in Morad "is therefore not to be preferred.

The people had relied upon the strong hand of the Lord, which had been so wonderfully stretched out for them. From Joshua downwards, every one felt that, for some unknown reason, that support had been withdrawn. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 7:6-15. JOSHUA'S PRAYER AND GOD'S ANSWER. - <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But in order to complete the ban pronounced upon Jericho in perfect accordance with the command of God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">Deuteronomy 13:17</a>, and to make the destruction of it a memorial to posterity of the justice of God sanctifying itself upon the ungodly, Joshua completed the ban with an oath: "Cursed be the man before the Lord that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho; he shall lay the foundation thereof at the price of his first-born, and set up its gates at the price of his youngest son" (&#1489;&#1468; denoting the price of a thing). The rhythmical parallelism is unmistakeable in this curse. The two last clauses express the thought that the builder of the town would pay for its restoration by the loss of all his sons, from the first-born to the very youngest. The word "buildeth," however, does not refer to the erection of houses upon the site of the town that had been burnt to ashes, but to the restoration of the town as a fortification, the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; being frequently used to denote the fortification of a town (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm">2 Chronicles 14:5-6</a>). This is evident in general from the fact that a town is not founded by the erection of a number of houses upon one spot, but by the joining of these houses together into an enclosed whole by means of a surrounding wall, but more particularly from the last words of the verse, in which &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is explained as &#1497;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (lay the foundation thereof) and &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1489; (set up the gates of it). Setting up the gates of a town is not setting up doors to the houses, but erecting town-gates, which can only be done when a town-wall has been built. But if setting up the gates would be a sign of the completion of the wall, and therefore of the restoration of the town as a fortification, the "founding" (laying the foundation) mentioned in the parallel clause can only be understood as referring to the foundation of the town-wall. This view of the curse, which is well supported both by the language and the facts, is also confirmed by the subsequent history. Joshua himself allotted Jericho to the Benjamites along with certain other towns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a>), which proves that he intended them to inhabit it; and accordingly we find the city of palms, i.e., Jericho, mentioned afterwards as an inhabited place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-5.htm">2 Samuel 10:5</a>), and yet it was not till the time of Ahab that Joshua's curse was fulfilled, when Hiel the Bethelite undertook to make it into a fortified town (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a>).<p>(Note: Knobel's opinion, that the Jericho mentioned between the times of Joshua and Ahab in all probability did not stand upon the old site which Hiel was the first to build upon again, is at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a>, as it is not stated there that he rebuilt the old site of Jericho, but that he began to build the town of Jericho, which existed, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-5.htm">2 Samuel 10:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>, in the time of David, and even of the judges, i.e., to restore it as a fortified town; and it is not raised into a truth by any appeal to the statements of Strabo, Appian, and others, to the effect that Greeks and Romans did not choose places for building upon which any curse rested.)</body></html>
