See what a great deal of work may be done in a little time, if we will be diligent, and improve our opportunities. God here showed his hatred of the idolatries and other abominations of which the Canaanites had been guilty, and shows us how great the provocation was, by the greatness of the destruction brought upon them. Here also was typified the destruction of all the enemies of the Lord Jesus, who, having slighted the riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath. The Lord fought for Israel. They could not have gotten the victory, if God had not undertaken the battle. We conquer when God fights for us; if he be for us, who can be against us?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king thereof - No doubt the successor of the king slain at Makkedah <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-23.htm">Joshua 10:23</a>.<p>All the cities thereof - i. e. the smaller towns dependent upon Hebron.
