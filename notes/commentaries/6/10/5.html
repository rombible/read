By such methods Satan discourages many who are convinced of their danger, and almost persuaded to be Christians, but fear the cross.

Jarmuth, afterward one of the cities of Judah <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>, is probably identified with the modern Yarmuk. Lachish was also a city of Judah <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>, and, like Jarmuth, occupied by Jews after the captivity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-39.htm">Nehemiah 11:39</a>. It was fortified by Rehoboam after the revolt of the Ten tribes <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>, and seems to have been regarded as one of the safest places of refuge <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>.

It by no means follows, however, that Joshua sent them there at that very time, but simply that he sentenced them to service at the altar in the place which would be chosen for the sanctuary.
