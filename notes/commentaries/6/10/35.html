See what a great deal of work may be done in a little time, if we will be diligent, and improve our opportunities. God here showed his hatred of the idolatries and other abominations of which the Canaanites had been guilty, and shows us how great the provocation was, by the greatness of the destruction brought upon them. Here also was typified the destruction of all the enemies of the Lord Jesus, who, having slighted the riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath. The Lord fought for Israel. They could not have gotten the victory, if God had not undertaken the battle. We conquer when God fights for us; if he be for us, who can be against us?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gezer lies on the southern border of the tribe of Ephraim <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>.

Libnah was one of the towns of the plain or of the hill-country of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42</a>); it was allotted to the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13</a>), revolted from Judah in the reign of Joram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>), and was besieged by Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>). It is to be sought on the north-west of Lachish, not on the south as Knobel erroneously infers from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>. According to the Onom. (s. v. Lebna), it was at that time villa in regione Eleutheropolitana, quae appellatur Lobna. It has not been discovered yet; but according to the very probable conjecture of V. de Velde (Mem. p. 330), the ruins of it may perhaps be seen upon the hill called Ark el Menshiyeh, about two hours to the wets of Beit Jibrin.<p>(Note: Knobel is decidedly wrong in his supposition, that Libnah is to be seen in the considerable ruins called Hora, which lie in the plain (Seetzen and V. de Velde) and are called Hawara by Robinson. He founds his conjecture upon the fact that the name signifies white, and is the Arabic translation of the Hebrew name. But Hora is only two hours and a half to the north of Beersheba, and is not in the plain at all, but in the Negeb.)</body></html>
