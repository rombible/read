See what a great deal of work may be done in a little time, if we will be diligent, and improve our opportunities. God here showed his hatred of the idolatries and other abominations of which the Canaanites had been guilty, and shows us how great the provocation was, by the greatness of the destruction brought upon them. Here also was typified the destruction of all the enemies of the Lord Jesus, who, having slighted the riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath. The Lord fought for Israel. They could not have gotten the victory, if God had not undertaken the battle. We conquer when God fights for us; if he be for us, who can be against us?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gezer lies on the southern border of the tribe of Ephraim <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>.

He contented himself for the present with repulsing the attack made upon him, killed Horam (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-12.htm">Joshua 12:12</a>), inflicting a severe defeat upon his people, and then continued to pursue his conquests over the confederated kings and their allies in south Canaan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 10:28-42.

Joshua "passes" from one city to another in the plain. He "goes up" to Hebron, which is situated among the hills. See note on ver. 3; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Hebron</span>. Commentators of the school of Maurer and De Wette regard the taking of Hebron and Debir as irreconcilable with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-17</a>. But this is by no means certain. The operations of Joshua were sudden, and, so far as they went, decisive, But it is never pretended that his conquest of southern Palestine was complete. It is impossible to assert this in the face of such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>, 17:12, 13, and especially in the face of such a fact as the continued existence of the Philistine power. Joshua extirpated the inhabitants of the cities he took, but there were many others - some of at least equal importance  - which he did not take. We may instance Gaza, Garb, and Ashdod. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a>. Their inhabitants came and occupied again the cities which Joshua had destroyed, first when he was engaged in operations in the north and west, and again when the Israelites had begun to repose upon their laurels, and to neglect the task God had set them, namely, the complete extermination of the Canaanite race from Palestine. Thus Joshua returned from the north and found a large part of the country he had subdued reoccupied by the giant tribes of the south. He "cut them off from Hebron and Debir," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he compelled them to evacuate those cities, but there was no necessity for a second of either. Yet at a later period they still lurked in the neighborhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>), perhaps in the mountain fastnessess (a very common thing in the history of nations, as the history of our own country, of the Basques in the Pyrenees, and of Swiss freedom shows), and were strong enough to regain Debir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>). Jerusalem itself (see note on ver. 1) had a similar fate. After the capture of Jerusalem the Israelites were unable to hold it permanently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8, 21</a>). And such expressions as "all the cities thereof" show that the south of Palestine was thickly populated. Each city was, like Gibeon, the head of a small confederacy. And as the chief cities smitten by Joshua would have been but a tithe of the confederations existing in the south, the task of reoccupying must have been an easy one. It seems to be implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1.htm">Judges 1</a>. that Caleb took Hebron and Debir after Joshua's death. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From Makkedah he went with all Israel, i.e., all the men of war, against Libnah, and after effecting the conquest of it, did just the same as he had done to Makkedah. Libnah was one of the towns of the plain or of the hill-country of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42</a>); it was allotted to the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13</a>), revolted from Judah in the reign of Joram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>), and was besieged by Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>). It is to be sought on the north-west of Lachish, not on the south as Knobel erroneously infers from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>. According to the Onom. (s. v. Lebna), it was at that time villa in regione Eleutheropolitana, quae appellatur Lobna. It has not been discovered yet; but according to the very probable conjecture of V. de Velde (Mem. p. 330), the ruins of it may perhaps be seen upon the hill called Ark el Menshiyeh, about two hours to the wets of Beit Jibrin.<p>(Note: Knobel is decidedly wrong in his supposition, that Libnah is to be seen in the considerable ruins called Hora, which lie in the plain (Seetzen and V. de Velde) and are called Hawara by Robinson. He founds his conjecture upon the fact that the name signifies white, and is the Arabic translation of the Hebrew name. But Hora is only two hours and a half to the north of Beersheba, and is not in the plain at all, but in the Negeb.)</body></html>
