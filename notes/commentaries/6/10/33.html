See what a great deal of work may be done in a little time, if we will be diligent, and improve our opportunities. God here showed his hatred of the idolatries and other abominations of which the Canaanites had been guilty, and shows us how great the provocation was, by the greatness of the destruction brought upon them. Here also was typified the destruction of all the enemies of the Lord Jesus, who, having slighted the riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath. The Lord fought for Israel. They could not have gotten the victory, if God had not undertaken the battle.

M. Clermont Ganneau discovered the ancient site, with the very name itself still lingering on the spot. Not only that, but he found the Levitical boundaries. In no other case have these been found. They were cut in the rock itself—not on movable stones—in two separate places, in Greek and square Hebrew characters, signifying the ‘boundary of Gezer.’ The date seems to be Maccabean.” (<span class="ital">Quarterly Statement</span> of the “Palestine Exploration Fund,” 1874.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Joshua smote him</span>] Joshua seems to have been content with repulsing his attack, slaying the king, and inflicting a severe defeat upon his people. Gezer itself lay too far northward of his present line of operations to justify its capture.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Horam king of Gezer.</span> It is remarkable that, as Gezer lay somewhat out of the line of march, Joshua did not capture it. Accordingly, in spite of the alleged carelessness of our compiler, who is credited with having put together shreds of the various narratives in the most perfunctory manner, he takes care to add (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>) that the inhabitants of Gezer were not driven out. In like manner, with the single exception of Hebron, the people of which must have at once chosen another king, he carefully omits the mention of the king in the cities which had lost their kings in the battle before Gibeon. See also note on ver. 32. Thus a careful examination of the narrative puts the care and accuracy of the history very carefully before us. With regard to the situation of Gezer, it has been accurately determined by the Palestine Exploration Society. The Levitical boundaries, with Greek and Hebrew inscriptions, signifying the boundary of Gezer, have been discovered by M. Ganneau (see 'Quarterly Paper' for October, 1874). Tell el Jezer was first identified by M. Ganneau with Gezer. Continuing his researches, he found on a slab of rock nearly horizontal and very nearly two inches in length a bilingual inscription, in Greek and Hebrew, signifying the limit of Gezer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span>). Since the inscription is Greek and Talmudical in its character (the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> has not the signification of "limit" in the Hebrew Scriptures) it must, in spite of the early form of the letters, belong to a period long subsequent to the Babylonish captivity. M. Ganneau suggests the Maccabean period. (See below.) But it is, no doubt, the result of a remeasurement in accordance with the rules laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a>. Some have supposed the above to have been designed to fix the limit of the sabbath day's journey. But it is more probable that it served as a boundary between the Levitical and the tribal territory, the more especially as the words are so placed as to be read by one <span class="accented">entering</span> the town. It was a Levitical city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-67.htm">1 Chronicles 6:67</a>), or at least assigned to the Levites; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a> shows that the Canaanitish population lived on with the Levites. It may have been the nondescript character of the population that caused it to fall an easy prey to Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>, where note that the Canaanites had never been driven out); but when Solomon espoused his daughter he restored Gezer to Israel. Under the same name Gazara it plays a conspicuous part in the wars of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 9:52; 2 Macc. 10:32). From the latter passage we learn that it was "a very strong hold." It retains its old name, being now known as Tell el Jezer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua then commanded the five kings to be fetched out of the cave, and directed the leaders of the army to set their feet upon the necks of the kings; and when this had been done, he ordered the kings to be put to death, and to be hanged upon trees until the evening, when their bodies were to be thrown into the cave in which they had concealed themselves. Of course this did not take place till the day after the battle, as the army could not return from their pursuit of the foe to the camp at Makkedah till the night after the battle; possibly it did not take place till the second day, if the pursuit had lasted any longer. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>, "all the men of Israel" are all the warriors in the camp. &#1492;&#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, with &#1492; artic., instead of the relative pronoun (see Ges. 109; Ew. 331, b.); and the ending &#1493;&#1468;&#1488; for &#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a> (see Ew. 190, b.). The fact that the military leaders set their feet at Joshua's command upon the necks of the conquered kings, was not a sign of barbarity, which it is necessary to excuse by comparing it with still greater barbarities on the part of the Canaanites, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>, but was a symbolical act, a sign of complete subjugation, which was customary in this sense even in the Eastern empire (see Bynaeus de calceis, p. 318, and Constant. Porphyrogen de cerimon. aulae Byzant. ii. 19). It was also intended in this instance to stimulate the Israelites to further conflict with the Canaanites. This is stated in the words of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-25.htm">Joshua 10:25</a>): "Fear not, nor be dismayed (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1</a>); for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies." On the putting to death and then hanging, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>. The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-27.htm">Joshua 10:27</a>) are generally understood as signifying, that after the bodies of the kings had been cast into the cave, the Israelites placed large stones before the entrance, just as in other cases heaps of stones were piled upon the graves of criminals that had been executed (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>), and that these stones remained there till the account before us was written. But this leaves the words &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1506;&#1491; unexplained, as &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; never occurs in any other case where the formula "until this day" is used with the simple meaning that a thing had continued to the writer's own time. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; expresses the thought that the day referred to was the very same day about which the author was writing, and no other (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-11.htm">Joshua 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17</a>, etc.). If, therefore, it has any meaning at all in the present instance, we must connect the whole clause with the one preceding, and even construe it as a relative clause: "where they (the kings) had hidden themselves, and they (the Israelites) had placed large stones at the mouth of the cave until that very day" (on which the kings were fetched out and executed). </body></html>
