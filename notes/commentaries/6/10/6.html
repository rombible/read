Joshua Rescues It.<p>6-8. the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua&#8212;Their appeal was urgent and their claim to protection irresistible, on the ground, not only of kindness and sympathy, but of justice. In attacking the Canaanites, Joshua had received from God a general assurance of success (Jos 1:5). But the intelligence of so formidable a combination among the native princes seems to have depressed his mind with the anxious and dispiriting idea that it was a chastisement for the hasty and inconsiderate alliance entered into with the Gibeonites. It was evidently to be a struggle of life and death, not only to Gibeon, but to the Israelites. And in this view the divine communication that was made to him was seasonable and animating. He seems to have asked the counsel of God and received an answer, before setting out on the expedition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The men of Gibeon sent</span>, or, <span class="ital">had sent</span>, when their enemies were drawn towards them, which they could easily learn. <span class="ital">Slack not thy hand</span>; do not neglect nor delay to help us. <span class="ital">From thy servants</span>, whom thou art obliged to protect both in duty, as thou art our master and ruler; and by thy own interest, we being part of thy possessions; and in ingenuity, because we have given ourselves to thee, and put ourselves under thy protection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the mountains; </span> in the mountainous country. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,.... Which some think they did when besieged, and not before, which showed their faith in the power of God, whom they now professed; but it is not likely that they should defer sending for help so long, since it is reasonable to suppose they might have heard of the design of the five kings against them; or that they should be able to send out messengers when surrounded on all sides; it may be better therefore to render the words, "had sent" (m), which they did as soon as they heard of the preparations made by the five kings to war with them, and of their rendezvous at Jerusalem, and especially as soon as they had information of their march towards them: <p>saying, slack not thine hands from thy servants; they entreat that he would not neglect them, be indifferent to them, and delay to assist them, since they were his subjects; and were entitled to his protection: <p>come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; they did not doubt, if he made haste and helped them, but they should be saved by him: <p>for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.

The details of the confederacy were not fully known to the Gibeonites. There had not been time for that. It was only known that the storm was to break on them from the mountain region, Jerusalem (ver. 4) being the head quarters of the expedition. As a matter of fact, the kings who formed the confederacy principally inhabited the lowlands, as we have seen. No one could have hit upon this apparent contradiction yet real agreement but one whose narrative was compiled from authentic sources. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. He made them hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and indeed for the altar of the Lord," (assigning them) "to the place which God would choose," viz., for the altar. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; (to the place) is grammatically dependent upon &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1501; (he "gave them"). It by no means follows, however, that Joshua sent them there at that very time, but simply that he sentenced them to service at the altar in the place which would be chosen for the sanctuary. From the words "unto this day," it no doubt follows, on the one hand, that the account was written after the fact had taken place; but, on the other hand, it also follows from the future &#1497;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; (should, or shall choose), that it was written before the place was definitely fixed, and therefore before the building of Solomon's temple. </body></html>
