This shows their perfect safety. The kings were called to an account, as rebels against the Israel of God. Refuges of lies will but secure for God's judgment. God punished the abominable wickedness of these kings, the measure of whose iniquity was now full. And by this public act of justice, done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he would possess his people with the greater dread and detestation of the sins of the nations that God cast out from before them. Here is a type and figure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness, and of believers' victories through him. In our spiritual conflicts we must not be satisfied with obtaining some important victory. We must pursue our scattered enemies, searching out the remains of sin as they rise up in our hearts, and thus pursue the conquest. In so doing, the Lord will afford light until the warfare be accomplished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The thread of the narrative, broken by the four intermediate verses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-15</a>, is now resumed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 10:16-27.

Dr. Maclear remarks on the number of caves in Palestine (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-30.htm">Genesis 19:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-47.htm">Judges 20:47</a>), as well as the well-known caves of Adullam and Engedi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>, 24:3), and the cave in which a hundred prophets were concealed by Obadiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>). Also see note on Joshua 2:22. But Lieut. Conder believes that in this particular neighbourhood there were few caves. See note on Makkedah above, ver. 10. For "these five kings" the original has simply "five kings." The order of the narrative is somewhat interrupted by the introduction of Joshua's adjuration, and the account of the flight of the five kings. Compare ver. 11 with ver. 20. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Jehovah threw them into confusion," as He had promised in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>, and in all probability, judging from <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>, by dreadful thunder and lightning (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-6.htm">Psalm 144:6</a> : it is different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>). "Israel smote them in a great slaughter at Gibeon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Bethhoron," i.e., Upper Bethhoron (Beit Ur, el-Foka), which was nearest to Gibeon, only four hours distant on the north-west, on a lofty promontory between two valleys, one on the north, the other on the south, and was separated from Lower Bethhoron, which lies further west, by a long steep pass, from which the ascent to Upper Bethhoron is very steep and rocky, though the rock has been cut away in many places now, and a path made by means of steps (see Rob. Pal. iii. p. 59). This pass between the two places leads downwards from Gibeon towards the western plain, and was called sometimes the ascent, or going up to Bethhoron, and sometimes the descent, or going down from it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>), &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (1 Macc. 3:16, 24). Israel smote the enemy still further, "to Azekah and Makkedah:" so far were they pursued and beaten after the battle (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-21.htm">Joshua 10:21</a>). If we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>, according to which the enemy was smitten, from Bethhoron to Azekah, by a violent fall of hail, it is very evident that the two places were on the west of Bethhoron. And it is in perfect harmony with this that we find both places described as being in the lowland; Azekah in the hill-country between the mountains and the plain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>), Makkedah in the plain itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>). Azekah, which was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>), besieged by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>), and still inhabited after the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>), was not far from Socoh, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>; whilst sideways between the two was Ephes-dammim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>). Van de Velde has discovered the latter in the ruins of Damm, about an hour's journey east by south from Beit Nettif (Mem. p. 290), and consequently imagines that Azekah is to be found in the village of Ahbek, which stands upon a lofty mountain-top a mile and a half to the north of Damm, and about four of five miles N.N.E. of Shuweikeh, supposing this to be Aphek. The statement in the Onom. (s. v. &#x391;&#787;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;), &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x395;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, agrees with this. Makkedah is described in the Onom. as being eight Roman miles to the east of Eleutheropolis, and hence Knobel supposes it to have been near Terkumieh, or Morak; but he is wrong in his supposition, as in that case it would have been in the hill-country or upon the mountains, whereas it was one of the towns in the plain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>). Van de Velde's conjecture (p. 332) is a much more probable one, viz., that it is to be found in Summeil, a considerable village on an eminence in the plain, with a large public well 110 feet deep and 11 feet in diameter, with strongly built walls of hewn stones, where there is also part of an old wall, which to all appearance must formerly have belonged to a large square castle built of uncemented stones, resembling in some respects the oldest foundation wall of Beit Jibrin (Rob. Pal. ii. p. 368). It is two hours and a half to the north-west of Beit Jibrin, and there Van de Velde discovered the large cave (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16</a>), which Robinson has not observed (see his Journey through Syria and Palestine).</body></html>
