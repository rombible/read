See what a great deal of work may be done in a little time, if we will be diligent, and improve our opportunities. God here showed his hatred of the idolatries and other abominations of which the Canaanites had been guilty, and shows us how great the provocation was, by the greatness of the destruction brought upon them. Here also was typified the destruction of all the enemies of the Lord Jesus, who, having slighted the riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath. The Lord fought for Israel. They could not have gotten the victory, if God had not undertaken the battle. We conquer when God fights for us; if he be for us, who can be against us?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joshua returned - The words mark a change in the direction of the march.

For this also was a royal city, and had others dependent on it; and therefore must lie further from Hebron than before suggested; and indeed Burchard (k) says it was five or six miles from it, and another writer (l) says ten miles: <p>and they smote them with the edge of the sword; the inhabitants of Debir, and the other cities adjacent to it: <p>and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein, he left none remaining; and yet it seems this city recovered again, and was reinhabited, and after the death of Joshua was taken by Othniel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-11.htm">Judges 1:11</a>; unless, as before observed, with respect to Hebron, there is there a more particular account of the taking of it at this time: <p>as he had done to Hebron, so did he to Debir, and to the king thereof,  <p>as he had done also to Libnah and her king; that is, slew them. <p>(k) Apud Masium in loc.

Nothing is said about the capture of the town of Gezer. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>, it was still in the possession of the Canaanites when the land was divided, though this alone is not sufficient to prove that Joshua did not conquer it, as so many of the conquered towns were occupied by the Canaanites again after the Israelites had withdrawn. But its situation makes it very probable that Joshua did not conquer it at that time, as it was too much out of his road, and too far from Lachish. Gezer (lxx &#x393;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-16.htm">1 Chronicles 14:16</a> &#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, in 1 Macc. &#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; or &#x393;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; plur., in Josephus &#x393;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, Ant. vii. 4, 1, viii. 6, 1, and also &#x393;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, v. 1, 22, xii. 7, 4) was on the southern boundary of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>), and was given up by that tribe to the Levites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-9.htm">Joshua 16:9-10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-20.htm">Joshua 21:20-21</a>. It is very frequently mentioned. David pursued the Philistines to Gezer (Gazer), after they had been defeated at Gibeon or Geba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-25.htm">2 Samuel 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-16.htm">1 Chronicles 14:16</a>). At a later period it was conquered by Pharaoh, and presented to his daughter, who was married to Solomon; and Solomon built, i.e., fortified it (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16-17</a>). It was an important fortress in the wars of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 9:52; 2 Macc. 10:32; cf. 1 Macc. 4:15; 7:45; 13:53; 14:34; 15:28, 35). According to the Onom. (s. v. Gazer), it was four Roman miles to the north of Nicopolis, i.e., Anwas, and was called &#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;. This is not only in harmony with <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>, according to which the southern border of Ephraim ran from Lower Bethhoron to Gezer, and then on to the sea, but also with all the other passages in which Gezer is mentioned, <p>(Note: The statement in 1 Macc. 7:45, that Judas Maccabaeus pursued the army of Nicanor, which had been beaten at Adasa, for a day's journey, as far as Gazera ("a day's journey from Adasa into Gazera"), is perfectly reconcilable with the situation of el Kubab; for, according to Josephus (Ant. xii. 10, 5), Adasa was thirty stadia from Bethhoron, and Bethhoron is ten miles to the west of Jubab (measuring in a straight line upon the map); so that Judas pursued the enemy fifteen miles - a distance which might very well be called "a day's journey," if we consider that the enemy, when flying, would not always take the straightest road, and might even make a stand at intervals, and so delay their pursuers. Still less do the statement in 1 Macc. 14:34, that Simon fortified Joppa on the sea, and Gazara on the border of Ashdod, the combination of Joppa, Gazara, and the tower that is in Jerusalem (1 Macc. 15:28, 35), and the fact that the country of Gadaris, with the town of Gadara, occurs between Joppa and Jamnia in Strabo xvi. 759, warrant us in making a distinction between Gazara (Gezer) and the place mentioned in the Onom., as Grimm does (on 1 Macc. 4:15), and identifying it with the village of Jazr, an hour and a half from Jaffa, although Arvieux calls this village Gesser. The objections of Van de Velde against the identity of Jubab and Gazer are without any force. It does not necessarily follow from the expression "went up," that Lachish stood on higher ground than Gezer, as going up often signifies nothing more than making a hostile attack upon a fortification. And no importance can be attached to the conjecture, that with the great distance of Jubab from Um Lakis, the king of Gezer would have come to the help of the kings of Makkedah and Libnah, who were much nearer and were attacked first, as the circumstances which determined his conduct are too thoroughly unknown to us, for it to be possible to pronounce an opinion upon the subject with any certainty.)<p>and answers very well to the situation of El Kubab, a village of considerable size on a steep hill at the extreme north of the mountain chain which runs to the north-west of Zorea, and slopes off towards the north into the broad plain of Merj el Omeir, almost in the middle of the road from Ramleh to Yalo. For this village, with which Van Semden identifies Gezer (Van de Velde, Mem. p. 315), was exactly four Roman miles north by west of Anwas, according to Robinson's map, and not quite four hours from Akir (Ekron), the most northerly city of the Philistines; so that Josephus (Ant. vii. 4, 1) could very properly describe Gazara as the frontier of the territory of the Philistines. Robinson discovered no signs of antiquity, it is true, on his journey through Kubab, but in all probability he did not look for them, as he did not regard the village as a place of any importance in connection with ancient history (Bibl. Res. pp. 143-4).</body></html>
