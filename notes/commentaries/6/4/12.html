The one set was erected by the command of God at the spot where they passed the night <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3</a>; the other by Joshua on the spot where the priests' feet rested while they bore up the ark during the passage of the people. This spot was near, or perhaps on, the eastern brink (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-8.htm">Joshua 3:8</a>). These stones would therefore mark the spot at which the people crossed, as the others marked the place in which they lodged the night after the crossing; nor, as the stones would only be reached by the water in flood time, and then by the utmost edge of it, is there any reason why they could not both be seen, and continue in their place as the writer asserts they did up to the time when he wrote. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. the children of Reuben &#8230; passed over armed before the children of Israel&#8212;There is no precedency to the other tribes indicated here; for there is no reason to suppose that the usual order of march was departed from; but these are honorably mentioned to show that, in pursuance of their promise (Jos 1:16-18), they had sent a complement of fighting men to accompany their brethren in the war of invasion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh,....
