The site of the camp was no doubt fortified by Joshua, as it constituted for some time the abiding foothold in Canaan, from where he sallied forth to subdue the country. It was also the place of safety where the ark, and no doubt also the women, children, cattle, and other property of the people were left. Hence, the demolition of Jericho and Ai, strong fortresses in the neighborhood of Gilgal, was no doubt dictated by sound policy as well as by religious obligations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month&#8212;that is, the month Nisan, four days before the passover, and the very day when the paschal lamb required to be set apart, the providence of God having arranged that the entrance into the promised land should be at the feast.<p>and encamped in Gilgal&#8212;The name is here given by anticipation (see on [176]Jos 5:9).

We find Gilgal mentioned again, (<span class="ital">a</span>) in the time of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.">1 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm" title="And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.">1 Samuel 10:8</a>), and (<span class="ital">b</span>) some sixty years later in the history of David’s return to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-15.htm" title="So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.">2 Samuel 19:15</a>). The name is here mentioned by anticipation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Why the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.">Joshua 5:9</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the tenth day of the first month.</span> This statement, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10</a>, will bear close analysis, and refutes the clumsy compiler theory. There was just time between the tenth and fourteenth day of the month for the events described in the meantime. And the scrupulous obedience to the law, the provisions of which, we are expressly told, had been of necessity neglected hitherto, is a fact closely in keeping with the character of Joshua, and the whole spirit of the narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Gilgal</span>. The <span class="accented">Gilgal</span>, according to the Masorites, no doubt from its being a circular encampment. Not as yet, however, called by this name (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>). It was "about five miles" (50 stadia, according to Josephus), "from the river banks" (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 307). We gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-3.htm">Joshua 5:3</a> that it was a rising ground, but it is impossible to identify the spot, since there never existed any town or village there. A spot is shown by the inhabitants about two miles from Jericho, which is held by them in great reverence, but this is further from Jericho than Josephus imagines it to be, for he places it about a mile and a quarter from Jericho. Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 216) identifies Riha (see note on Joshua 2:1) with Gilgal, but Bartlett (p. 452) places it "a mile east of Riha," "some three miles or more from the fords." It is hardly probable, however, that the Israelites, in their then unprepared condition (see next chapter, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>), encamped so near the city, even though they were conscious of Divine protection, as Josephus would have us suppose. It has been denied by some that the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6</a> is the same as this one (see notes there, as well as the Masoretic translation above). The reverence for sacred places, such as Gilgal, degenerated in the course of time, according to a well known law of humanity, into superstition - a superstition severely rebuked by the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a>). We may compare the idolatrous worship of the brazen serpent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). It is sometimes contended by Roman Catholic commentators that no approval of the conduct of Hezekiah is here expressed; but a comparison of this passage with those above cited will show in which direction the minds of inspired men tended. Other places seem to have been similarly regarded with superstitious reverence. Not only do we find Bethel mentioned among such places as we might well expect from Jeroboam's idolatrous worship there, but Beersheba also seems to have become a seat of this misdirected devotion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The account of the fighting men of the tribes on the east of the Jordan passing over along with them, in number about 40,000, is added as a supplement, because there was no place in which it could be appropriately inserted before, and yet it was necessary that it should be expressly mentioned that these tribes performed the promise they had given (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-16.htm">Joshua 1:16-17</a>), and in what manner they did so. The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; do not imply that these 40,000 men crossed over behind the priests with the ark, which would not only be at variance with the fact so expressly stated, that the ark of the covenant was the medium of the miraculous division of the water, but also with the distant statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-18.htm">Joshua 4:18</a>, that when the priests, with the ark, set their feet upon the dry land, the waters filled the river again as they had done before. The imperfect with vav consec. here expresses simply the order of thought, and not of time. "Arboth Jericho," the steppes of Jericho, were that portion of the Arabah or Ghor which formed the environs of Jericho, and which widens here into a low-lying plain of about three and a half or four hours' journey in breadth, on account of the western mountains receding considerably to the south of the opening of the Wady Kelt (Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 263ff.). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-14.htm">Joshua 4:14</a> the writer mentions still further the fact that the Lord fulfilled His promise (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>), and by means of this miracle so effectually confirmed the authority of Joshua in the eyes of Israel, that the people feared him all the days of his life as they had feared Moses. "This was not the chief end of the miracle, that Joshua increased in power and authority; but since it was a matter of great importance, so far as the public interests were concerned, that the government of Joshua should be established, it is very properly mentioned, as an addition to the benefits that were otherwise conferred, that he was invested as it were with sacred insignia, which produced such a felling of veneration among the people, that no one dared to treat him with disrespect" (Calvin). </body></html>
