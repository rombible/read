Let none be weary of waiting, while they have the tokens of God's presence with them, even the ark of the covenant, though it be in the depths of adversity. Notice is taken of the honour put upon Joshua. Those are feared in the best manner, and to the best purpose, who make it appear that God is with them, and that they set him before them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The passage of the priests to the further bank had been already referred to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-11.htm">Joshua 4:11</a>; but the writer, in observance of his general plan (compare introductory remarks to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3</a>), re-introduces it here as the leading feature in the concluding section of his account, and (as before) with mention of God's special direction about it. The statement that on the removal of the ark the waters of Jordan at once returned to their former level <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-18.htm">Joshua 4:18</a>, heightens the impression which is especially inculcated throughout - that the whole transaction was extraordinary and miraculous. The details and incidents of the passage are no doubt open to manifold discussion: but all such discussion will be futile unless it proceed throughout on the admission that we have here before us the record of a distinctly supernatural interposition: compare the introduction to the Book of Joshua. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 4:14-24. God Magnifies Joshua.<p>14-17. On that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel&#8212;It appeared clear from the chief part he acted, that he was the divinely appointed leader; for even the priests did not enter the river or quit their position, except at his command; and thenceforward his authority was as firmly established as that of his predecessor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The priests</span> staid contentedly in the river, till God by Joshua called them out. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Joshua therefore commanded the priests,....

The words "according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua" do not refer to any special instructions which Moses had given to Joshua with reference to the crossing, for no such instructions are to be found in the Pentateuch, nor can they be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-23.htm">Numbers 27:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-28.htm">Deuteronomy 3:28</a>, or <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>; they simply affirm that Joshua carried out all the commands which the Lord had given him, in accordance with the charge which he received from Moses at the time when he was first called. Moses had called him and instructed him to lead to the people into the promised land, in consequence of a divine command; and had given him the promise, at the same time, that Jehovah would be with him as He had been with Moses. This contained implicite an admonition to Joshua to do only what the Lord should command him. And if this was how Joshua acted, the execution of the commands of God was also an observance of the command of Moses. The remark in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-10.htm">Joshua 4:10</a>, "and the people hastened and passed over," i.e., passed hastily through the bed of the river, is introduced as an explanation of the fact that the priests stood still in the bed of the river the whole time that the crossing continued. As the priests stood in one spot whilst all the people were passing over, it was necessary that the people should hasten over, lest the strength of the priests should be exhausted. This reason for hastening, however, does not preclude the other-namely, that the crossing had to be finished in one day, before night came on. The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-11.htm">Joshua 4:11</a>, that when all the people had passed over, the ark of the Lord also passed over with the priests, is so far anticipatory of the actual course of the events, that up to this time nothing has been said about the fighting men belonging to the two tribes and a half having passed over (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-12.htm">Joshua 4:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>); nor has the command of God for the ark to pass over been mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-15.htm">Joshua 4:15</a>.), though both of these must have preceded the crossing of the ark in order of time. It is to be observed, that, in the words "the art of the Lord passed over, and the priests," the priests are subordinate to the ark, because it was through the medium of the ark of the Lord that the miracle of drying up the river had been effected: it was not by the priests, but by Jehovah the Almighty God, who was enthroned upon the ark, that the waters were commanded to stand still. "Before the people" (Eng. Ver. "in the presence of the people") has the same signification in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-11.htm">Joshua 4:11</a> as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14</a>.</body></html>
