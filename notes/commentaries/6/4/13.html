Thus the entire force of the two and a half tribes might amount to 110,580. They therefore left more than half their number to protect their families and their dwellings. This does not seem inconsistent with the spirit of their agreement with Moses, or with the interpretation of that agreement by Joshua and their fellow-Israelites. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/32-16.htm" title="And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:">Numbers 32:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-24.htm" title="Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.">Numbers 32:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-26.htm" title="Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:">Numbers 32:26</a>.) The permission to <span class= "ital">build </span>cities implies the right to fortify and defend them.<p>Reuben, Gad, and Simeon formed the second division on the march in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/10-18.htm" title="And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.">Numbers 10:18-20</a>). Why Reuben and Gad discarded Simeon, and associated themselves with part of Manasseh, is not explained.

The mountains of Judaea here recede somewhat from the river, and leave a level and fertile space, which, at the time of Joshua's invasion, was principally occupied by a forest of palms. Hence, the name "city of palms," <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. to the plains of Jericho&#8212;That part of the Arabah or Ghor, on the west, is about seven miles broad from the Jordan to the mountain entrance at Wady-Kelt.

Accoutred with proper armour to defend themselves, and their brethren, and annoy their enemies: this is to be understood of such a number of the above mentioned tribes; otherwise the number of all Israel that went over Jordan, even armed or fighting men, besides women and children, were five hundred thousand or more. Now though the number of men fit for war, of these tribes, were an hundred thirty thousand, who were all, according to the original agreement, under obligation to go with their brethren over Jordan into Canaan's land, and continue with them until it was subdued, and they had rest in it; yet Joshua took no more than about forty thousand of them, who we may suppose were select men, and fit for his purpose; the rest were left to look after their flocks, their families, and their lands: these <p>passed over before the Lord unto battle; over Jordan, before the ark of the Lord, as that stood in Jordan, bore by the priests there, being ready to engage in battle whenever it was necessary: and they went on with their brethren <p>to the plains of Jericho; to a place afterwards called Gilgal; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>.

They formed a "low-lying plain about four hours' journey in breadth," at that time largely covered with palm trees and thorny acacias, but apparently not cultivated. Since that time, the palms having disappeared, the plain has become "a very picture of fertility," "covered with luxuriant vegetation" (Bartlett, 'From Egypt to Palestine,' p. 453. See also note on Joshua 3:16). The valley narrows to a gorge at Jericho, through which the Kelt, according to Robinson the ancient Cherith, flows, the source of all the verdure which once bloomed around the city. The gorge of the Kelt Canon Tristram describes as "tremendous," but he believes the Cherith to have been eastward of Jordan, following Mr. Grove, who is here disposed to accept the. tradition of Eusebius and Jerome. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This (viz., their taking the twelve stones with them and setting them up) was to be a sign in Israel; the stones were to serve as a memorial of the miraculous crossing of the Jordan to all succeeding generations.
