Love the Lord your God, and you will not leave him. Has God been thus true to you? Be not you false to him. He is faithful that has promised, Heb 10:23. The experience of every Christian witnesses the same truth. Conflicts may have been severe and long, trials great and many; but at the last he will acknowledge that goodness and mercy followed him all the days of his life. Joshua states the fatal consequences of going back; know for a certainty it will be your ruin. The first step would be, friendship with idolaters; the next would be, marrying with them; the end of that would be, serving their gods. Thus the way of sin is down-hill, and those who have fellowship with sinners, cannot avoid having fellowship with sin. He describes the destruction he warns them of. The goodness of the heavenly Canaan, and the free and sure grant God has made of it, will add to the misery of those who shall for ever be shut out from it. Nothing will make them see how wretched they are, so much, as to see how happy they might have been. Let us watch and pray against temptation. Let us trust in God's faithfulness, love, and power; let us plead his promises, and cleave to his commandments, then we shall be happy in life, in death, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All Israel, and for their elders - Omit "and," which is not in the Hebrew.

Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-9.htm" title="The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.">Job 18:9</a>, “the gin shall take him by the heel;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-22.htm" title="Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them: for they have dig a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.">Jeremiah 18:22</a>, “they have … hid <span class="ital">snares</span> for my feet.” The form of this trap-net appears from the passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-5.htm" title="Can a bird fall in a snare on the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?">Amos 3:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-22.htm" title="Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.">Psalm 69:22</a>. It was in two parts, which, when set, were spread out upon the ground and slightly fastened with a stick, so that as soon as a bird or beast touched the stick, the parts flew up and enclosed the bird in the net, or caught the foot of the animal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thorns in your eyes</span>] The warnings of Joshua are severer even than those of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm" title="But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell.">Numbers 33:55</a>), “nowe thanne wite зe that the Lord зoure God do hem not awey before зoure face, but to зow thei shulen be into a diche, and greene, and hurtynge of зoure side and a <span class="ital">staak in зoure eyen</span>, to the tyme that he doo зou a wey,” Wyclif.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Snares and traps.</span> Perhaps, rather, <span class="accented">nets and snares.</span> The LXX., where our translation has snare, has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, and for traps has incorrectly <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>. The snare or <span class="accented">pach</span> was evidently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>) laid upon the earth; but there is no evidence for Gesenius' idea that the <span class="accented">mokesh</span> which follows, there as here, means the stick of the trap, which when displaced involved the bird in the net. As the primary signification of this latter word, which is akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> a bow, seems to mean something curved, it is probably a noose or springe. And the word and its cognates are used of involving, or catching, people by its use. Furst's Lexicon confirms this view, which has been independently arrived at. <span class="cmt_word">Scourges</span>. The Hebrew word is in the singular. It is translated <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, nails, in the LXX., and <span class="accented">offendiculum in the</span> Vulgate. <span class="cmt_word">In your sides.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">on</span> your sides. The words here are very similar to those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>. Moses, however, does but use two of the similes of which here we have four. He has, moreover, a different word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) for thorns, and the word here translated thorns is there substituted for scourges; "thorns in your sides." Joshua crowds together his similes "to describe the shame, and trouble, and oppression which they would bring upon themselves by joining in the idolatry of the Canaanites" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord your God.</span> Here, as elsewhere in this and many other passages, we have in the original, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> your God. It is important to remember that the sacred writer is calling the God of Israel by His own proper name, that by which He was distinguished from the gods of the nations round about. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Only let them be strong, i.e., be brave, to keep the law of Moses without fail (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>), to enter into no fellowship with these remaining nations (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, to enter into close intimacy with a person; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a>), and not to pay reverence to their gods in any way, but to adhere stedfastly to the Lord their God as they had hitherto done. To make mention of the names of the idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a>), to swear by them, to serve them (by sacrifices), and to bow down to them (to invoke them in prayer), are the four outward forms of divine worship (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>). The concluding words, "as ye have done unto this day," which express a reason for persevering in the attachment they had hitherto shown to Jehovah, "do not affirm that the Israelites had hitherto done all these things fully and perfectly; for who does not know how few mortals there are who devote themselves to God with all the piety and love which He justly demands? But because the nation as a whole had kept the laws delivered to them by Moses, during the time that the government had been in the hands of Joshua, the sins of individual men were left out of sight on this occasion" (Masius).</body></html>
