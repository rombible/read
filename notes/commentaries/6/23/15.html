Love the Lord your God, and you will not leave him. Has God been thus true to you? Be not you false to him. He is faithful that has promised, Heb 10:23. The experience of every Christian witnesses the same truth. Conflicts may have been severe and long, trials great and many; but at the last he will acknowledge that goodness and mercy followed him all the days of his life. Joshua states the fatal consequences of going back; know for a certainty it will be your ruin. The first step would be, friendship with idolaters; the next would be, marrying with them; the end of that would be, serving their gods. Thus the way of sin is down-hill, and those who have fellowship with sinners, cannot avoid having fellowship with sin. He describes the destruction he warns them of. The goodness of the heavenly Canaan, and the free and sure grant God has made of it, will add to the misery of those who shall for ever be shut out from it. Nothing will make them see how wretched they are, so much, as to see how happy they might have been. Let us watch and pray against temptation. Let us trust in God's faithfulness, love, and power; let us plead his promises, and cleave to his commandments, then we shall be happy in life, in death, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All Israel, and for their elders - Omit "and," which is not in the Hebrew.

The sublimity of the denunciations of the Hebrew lawgiver contained in these passages “surpasses anything in the oratory or the poetry of the whole world. Nature is exhausted in furnishing terrific images; nothing, excepting the real horrors of the Jewish history—the miseries of their sieges, the cruelty, the contempt, the oppressions, the persecutions, which, for ages, this scattered and despised and detested nation have endured—can approach the tremendous maledictions which warned them against the violation of their Law.” Milman’s <span class="ital">History of the Jews</span>, i. 211.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All good things.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">all the good word.</span> That is to say, the prophecies of good had been fulfilled. Joshua uses this as an argument that the evil also will not fail to follow, if Israel provoke God to inflict it. But the memory of these words, and of the great deeds of Jehovah, faded quickly from their minds. And then, like the people of the earth before the flood, like the men of Sodom before it was destroyed, and like many other people since, they turned a deaf ear to the prophecies of evil which faithful souls foresaw and foretold. The warnings of the prophets are but a variation upon the predictions of Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-14.htm">Deuteronomy 29:14-28</a>, and of Joshua, here addressed to a generation who had brought some of the predicted evil upon themselves, and would not see that by refusing to listen, they would bring upon themselves yet more. How terribly have these predictions been fulfilled! First, the Babylonish captivity; then the disorders and anarchy in a territory which the Jewish people inhabited, but which they were not strong enough to rule; then the siege of and destruction of Jerusalem under Titus with its accompanying horrors. Then the dispersion of the Jews among all the nations, the barbarous and inhuman persecutions they met with in the Middle Ages from priest and monarch alike: the Inquisition in Spain, the contempt and hatred which continued to be felt for them among more enlightened nations, as evidenced in Marlowe's 'Jew of Malta,' and Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice,' in the days of our own Queen Elizabeth. Only in our own age has a brighter day begun to dawn on them, and three thousand years of oppression, relieved only by the brief glories of David and his dynasty, are beginning to be compensated by a share in the world's rewards and honours. <span class="cmt_word">All evil things.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">all the evil word</span>; or <span class="accented">thing</span>; every evil thing, that is, which had been foretold. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For this reason the Lord had driven out great and strong nations before the Israelites, so that no one was able to stand before them. The first hemistich points to the fulfilment of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-38.htm">Deuteronomy 4:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-23.htm">Deuteronomy 11:23</a>; the second to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is placed at the beginning absolutely. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a>, the blessing of fidelity to the law which Israel had hitherto experienced, is described, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>, upon the basis of the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-7.htm">Leviticus 26:7-8</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a> the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-3.htm">Joshua 23:3</a> is repeated. To this there is attached, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-11.htm">Joshua 23:11-13</a>, the admonition to take heed for the sake of their souls (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>), to love the Lord their God (on the love of God as the sum of the fulfilment of the law, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>). For if they turned, i.e., gave up the faithfulness they had hitherto displayed towards Jehovah, and attached themselves to the remnant of these nations, made marriages with them, and entered into fellowship with them, which the Lord had expressly forbidden (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), let them know that the Lord their God would not cut off these nations before them any more, but that they would be a snare and destruction to them. This threat is founded upon such passages of the law as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>, and more especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>. The figure of a trap, which is employed here (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>), is still further strengthened by &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, a snare (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>). Shotet, a whip or scourge, an emphatic form of the word derived from the poel of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, only occurs here. "Scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>). Joshua crowds his figures together to depict the misery and oppression which would be sure to result from fellowship with the Canaanites, because, from his knowledge of the fickleness of the people, and the wickedness of the human heart in its natural state, he could foresee that the apostasy of the nation from the Lord, which Moses had foretold, would take place but too quickly; as it actually did, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>., in the very next generation. The words "until ye perish," etc., resume the threat held out by Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a> (cf. Josh Deu 28:21.). </body></html>
