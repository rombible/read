We are not to pass over these chapters of hard names as useless. Where God has a mouth to speak, and a hand to write, we should find an ear to hear, and an eye to read; and may God give us a heart to profit! Joshua is supposed to have been about one hundred years old at this time. It is good for those who are old and stricken in years to be put in remembrance of their being so. God considers the frame of his people, and would not have them burdened with work above their strength. And all people, especially old people, should set to do that quickly which must be done before they die, lest death prevent them, Ec 9:10. God promise that he would make the Israelites masters of all the countries yet unsubdued, through Joshua was old, and not able to do it; old, and not likely to live to see it done. Whatever becomes of us, and however we may be laid aside as despised, broken vessels, God will do his own work in his own time. We must work out our salvation, then God will work in us, and work with us; we must resist our spiritual enemies, then God will tread them under our feet; we must go forth to our Christian work and warfare, then God will go forth before us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sihor is derived from a root signifying "to be black," and is suitable enough as an appellative of the Nile <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>.

It was allotted to the tribe of Judah <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>, and was, with Askalon, taken by the warriors of that tribe <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-18.htm">Judges 1:18</a>. Both cities were soon re-occupied by the Philistines, and subsequently are always mentioned as Philistine cities. Gaza lay on the direct route of the Egyptian armies in their invasions of Syria, by whom it was captured more than once. Special judgments are denounced against Gaza for the cruelty of its people toward the Jews in the time of their humiliation <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-5.htm">Zechariah 9:5</a>, and in the time of Jerome the ancient city was a ruin of which the foundations could hardly be traced, and the then existing town was built on another site. Gaza was in later times an episcopal see, and is now a thriving place containing some 15,000 inhabitants, a larger population than that of Jerusalem.<p>Ashdod ("Esdud;" Azotus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>) was, like Gaza, allotted to Judah (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-46.htm">Joshua 15:46-47</a>), but was soon regained by the Philistines, and became a principal seat of their Dagon worship. Here the ark of God was taken after its capture by the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1</a> ff). Its name ( "fortress," "castle"), no less than its history (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7</a>, etc.) indicates its importance as a stronghold; it withstood for twenty-nine years the longest siege on record by the Egyptian king Psammetichus. Like Gaza, it was doomed by the Jewish prophets to desolation, and it was utterly destroyed by the Maccabees (1 Macc. 10:77-84; 11:4). It was, however, rebuilt by the Romans, and figures in Christian times as an episcopal city.<p>Askelon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-18.htm">Judges 1:18</a>), the birthplace of Herod the Great, figures as an important town and seaport in the history of the Crusades, and very massive ruins still attest the ancient strength and grandeur of the place. It is situated about midway between Gaza and Ashdod.<p>Gath seems to have been first taken by David <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>. It is not named again in the book of Joshua. It was the town of Goliath <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>, and is mentioned in David's elegy over Saul as a leading Philistine city <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>. It was the nearest of the Philistine cities to Jerusalem, but both the name and the city have perished; its site is conjecturally placed (by Condor) at Tell es Safi.<p>Avites - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4. also the Avites: From [on] the south&#8212;The two clauses are thus connected in the Septuagint and many other versions.

The Greeks called it <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. So Virgil says of it, "AEgyptum nigra foecundat arena." The Vulgate has "a fluvio turbido qui irrigat AEgyptum." The LXX. translates by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The phrase which is "before" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) Egypt seems to exclude the idea of the Nile, since the Nile flowed through the centre of Egypt, and it is impossible to make <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>. As Drusins remarks, moreover, the Nile is always called either <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> or "the river of Egypt." The interpreation which has found most favour of late, therefore, refers this expression to a small river that flows into the sea at the extreme southern border of Palestine. This river was known as the "river of Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), and is now called the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Arisch</span> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4, 47</a>, as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>, where the word is <span class="accented">nahal</span>, or <span class="accented">winter torrent</span>, a word inapplicable to the Nile).

Ewald (also Hitzig, 'Geschichte des Volkes Israel,' p. 20) believes Caphtor to be Crete, and supposes the Cherethites and Pelethites who formed David's body-guard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>) to be Cretans and Philistines (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>). But this opinion is disputed by many commentators of note, and is far from probable in itself. They were David's most trusted and faithful troops, and it seems hardly probable that so truly national a monarch would have assigned the post of honour around his person to the hereditary enemies of his race. Ritter, however, believes the Cherethites and Pelethites to be Philistines, and appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>, and still more forcibly to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4, 5</a>. It should be remembered, too, that Ittai was a Gittite, or native of Gath (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a>). The term here used, translated <span class="accented">lords</span> (<span class="accented">satraps</span>, LXX.), is peculiar to the Philistines. It is to be found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8</a>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a> the word means an <span class="accented">axle</span>, or perhaps the outside plating of the wheel, and in the kindred languages it signifies a wheel. The expression is remarkable in connection with the phrase "circles of the Philistines." <span class="cmt_word">The Eshkalalonites.</span> The inhabitants of Ashkelon, as the Gittites are of Gath. <span class="cmt_word">Also the Avites.</span> Literally, "and <span class="accented">the Avites."</span> There is no "also" in the original, though the Avites or Avim are supposed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, and note on Geshuri in the last verse)to have been aborigines preceding the Canaanites, and dispossessed by the Philistines. Keil, however, disputes this view, and holds that we have no evidence that any but a Canaanitish people dwelt in southwestern Palestine. This Canaanitish tribe, he thinks, was driven out by the Philistines. Some few of the Avites, or rather Avvites, continued to dwell among their conquerors. But the coincidence between <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-22.htm">Deuteronomy 2:22, 23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>, makes strongly for Ewald's view above.
