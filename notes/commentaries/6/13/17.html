It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal references for some of these names.

With whom&#8212;Hebrew, "him." The antecedent is evidently to Manasseh, not, however, the half-tribe just mentioned, but the other half; for the historian, led, as it were, by the sound of the word, breaks off to describe the possessions beyond Jordan already assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half of Manasseh (see on [190]Nu 32:1; [191]Nu 32:33; also see De 3:8-17). It may be proper to remark that it was wise to put these boundaries on record. In case of any misunderstanding or dispute arising about the exact limits of each district or property, an appeal could always be made to this authoritative document, and a full knowledge as well as grateful sense obtained of what they had received from God (Ps 16:5, 6).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Heshbon:</span> this city and Dibon and Ataroth were upon the borders of Reuben and Gad, and therefore sometimes are ascribed to Reuben, as here, and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm" title="And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,">Numbers 32:37</a></span>, sometimes to Gad, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-80.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Gad; Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, and Mahanaim with her suburbs,">1 Chronicles 6:80</a>,81</span>, by whom Heshbon, is said to be given to the Levites, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-39.htm" title="Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.">Joshua 21:39</a></span>.
