It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The King James Version would exhibit the sense more clearly if the words from the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2</a> to the words "the Sidonians" in this verse were placed in a parenthesis, and the order of the words before us changed thus: "I will drive them out."

In the event of the Israelites proving unfaithful or disobedient, they would not subdue the districts now specified; and, in point of fact, the Israelites never possessed them though the inhabitants were subjected to the power of David and Solomon.<p>only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance&#8212;The parenthetic section being closed, the historian here resumes the main subject of this chapter&#8212;the order of God to Joshua to make an immediate allotment of the land. The method of distribution by lot was, in all respects, the best that could have been adopted, as it prevented all ground of discontent, as well as charges of arbitrary or partial conduct on the part of the leaders; and its announcement in the life of Moses (Nu 33:54), as the system according to which the allocations to each tribe should be made, was intended to lead the people to the acknowledgment of God as the proprietor of the land and as having the entire right to its disposal. Moreover, a solemn appeal to the lot showed it to be the dictate not of human, but divine, wisdom. It was used, however, only in determining the part of the country where a tribe was to be settled&#8212;the extent of the settlement was to be decided on a different principle (Nu 26:54). The overruling control of God is conclusively proved because each tribe received the possession predicted by Jacob (Ge 49:3-28) and by Moses (De 33:6-25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance,....

Command of the Lord to Joshua to distribute the land of Canaan by lot among the nine tribes and a half. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1</a> contains only the commencement of the divine command; the conclusion follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7</a>. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2-6</a> form a parenthesis of several clauses, defining the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1</a> more fully. When Joshua had grown old, the Lord commanded him, as he was advanced in years, and there was still much land to be taken, to divide "this land," i.e., the whole of the land of Canaan, for an inheritance to the nine tribes and a half, and promised him at the same time that He would drive out the Canaanites from those portions of the land that were not yet conquered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>). The words "grown old and come into years" (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-1.htm">Genesis 24:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-11.htm">Genesis 18:11</a>, etc.) denote advanced age in its different stages up to the near approach of death (as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-1.htm">Joshua 23:1</a>). Joshua might be ninety or a hundred years old at this time. The allusion to Joshua's great age serves simply to explain the reason for the command of God. As he was already old, and there still remained much land to be taken, he was to proceed to the division of Canaan, that he might accomplish this work to which he was also called before his death; whereas he might very possibly suppose that, under existing circumstances, the time for allotting the land had not yet arrived. -  In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2-6</a> the districts that were not yet conquered are enumerated separately.</body></html>
