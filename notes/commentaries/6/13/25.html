It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the cities of Gilead - i. e. of Gilead in the narrower sense, included in the territory of Sihon, and distinct from Bashan <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>.<p>Half the land of the children of Ammon - i. e. that half of the Ammonite territory which had been conquered by the Amorites.

The antecedent is evidently to Manasseh, not, however, the half-tribe just mentioned, but the other half; for the historian, led, as it were, by the sound of the word, breaks off to describe the possessions beyond Jordan already assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half of Manasseh (see on [190]Nu 32:1; [191]Nu 32:33; also see De 3:8-17).

These limitations of the words are implied in the context: the first in the fact that towns in the plain are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>; the second in the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>, "the rest of the kingdom of Sihon," i.e., the northern portion of it, was given to the Gadites. The allusion to Sihon induced the author to mention his defeat again; see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>, where the five Midianitish vassals who were slain with Sihon are noticed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>, and the death of Balaam is also mentioned.
