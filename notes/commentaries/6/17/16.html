Joshua tells them, that what was fallen to their share would be a sufficient lot for them, if they would but work and fight. Men excuse themselves from labour by any pretence; and nothing serves the purpose better than having rich and powerful relations, able to provide for them; and they are apt to desire a partial and unfaithful disposal of what is intrusted to those they think able to give such help. But there is more real kindness in pointing out the advantages within reach, and in encouraging men to make the best of them, than in granting indulgences to sloth and extravagance. True religion gives no countenance to these evils. The rule is, They shall not eat who will not work; and many of our cannots are only the language of idleness, which magnifies every difficulty and danger. This is especially the case in our spiritual work and warfare. Without Christ we can do nothing, but we are apt to sit still and attempt nothing. if we belong to Him, he will stir us up to our best endeavours, and to cry to him for help. Then our coast will be enlarged, 1Ch 4:9,10, and complainings silenced, or rather, turned into joyful thanksgivings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The possession by the Canaanites of chariots strengthened and tipped with iron, such as were used by the Egyptians <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>, is named here by the children of Joseph as a reason why they could not possess themselves of the plains. "The valley of Jezreel" is the broad low valley which sweeps from "Zerin" between the mountains of Gilboa and the range of little Hermon eastward down to the Jordan. It was most likely in this valley that the host of the Midianites was encamped, when attacked by Gideon <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-8.htm">Judges 7:8</a>. The great plain of Jezreel, called the plain of Esdraelon (Esdrelom, Judith 1:8), extends from Carmel on the west to the hills of Gilboa, little Hermon, and Tabor on the east, a distance of full sixteen miles; and its breadth between the rocky mass of southern Palestine and the bolder mountains of Galilee on the north, is about twelve miles. Its position as well as its open area make it the natural battlefield of Palestine. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. chariots of iron&#8212;unusually strengthened with that metal, and perhaps armed with projecting scythes.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The hill is not enough for us; </span> if we should invade and conquer it, and cut down both wood and men, yet it would not be sufficient for us.

They were the main reason why the Israelites could not establish themselves in the plain, on which Beth-shean, Taanach, and Megiddo were situated. The forest they could occupy, but the plain, where the “chariot-cavalry” of their foes were so effective though powerless in the mountains, they could not reduce. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-19.htm" title="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jdg 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-3.htm" title="And the children of Israel cried to the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.">Jdg 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm" title="And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.">1 Samuel 13:5</a>. Compare as to the insecurity of the plains the remarks of Tristram: “No matter how wide, how rich, how well cultivated a plain may be, like Acre or Esdraelon, its tame monotony is never relieved by a single village. These are all hidden in the nooks of the mountains; for no fellâhin or cultivators would venture to dwell where any night they might be harried by a party of Bedouin troopers, and to this risk they gladly prefer an hour or two’s weary climb added to their daily toil: while no traveller would dream of encamping even for a night in the open plain.” <span class="ital">Land of Israel</span>, p. 421.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the valley</span>] As the “hill” here denotes Mount Ephraim, so the valley country includes both (<span class="ital">a</span>) the valley or <span class="ital">ghôr</span> of the Jordan near Bethshean, and (<span class="ital">b</span>) the wide plain of Jezreel, between Gilboa and little Hermon, to which, in its widest extent, the name of Esdraelon has been applied in modern times; a name first used in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/1-8.htm" title="And to those among the nations that were of Carmel, and Galaad, and the higher Galilee, and the great plain of Esdrelom,">Jdt 1:8</a>. “It was only this plain of Jezreel, and that north of Lake <span class="ital">Huleh</span>, that was then accessible to the chariots of the Canaanites. It was in this plain of Jezreel that Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went forth <span class="ital">in chariots</span> to meet the enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-21.htm" title="And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.">2 Kings 9:21</a>). It was here that Jehu passed in <span class="ital">a chariot</span> to Samaria, to meet the faithful Jehonadab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.">2 Kings 10:15</a>). And Wilson (<span class="ital">Lands of the Bible</span>, ii. 303), in leaving the hilly district of Judæa, wholly unfitted for vehicles, and entering the plain of Esdraelon at <span class="ital">Jenin</span>, was surprised to see how entirely it differed from the country which he had previously traversed, and how easily it might be crossed by excellent highways, if the custom of the country admitted of the use of vehicles. In the days of the Jews, the plain was so associated with the use of the chariot, that this term became to a certain extent an exponent of the power of the people inhabiting the plain. The <span class="ital">chariot</span> was the glory of Ephraim, as the horse was of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass....">Zechariah 9:9-10</a>).

The Ephraimites and Manassites blame Joshua when they ought to be blaming themselves. They excuse themselves from a task which they are too idle to execute, and wish Joshua to make arrangements for them which are wholly unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">The hill is not enough for us.</span> Literally, the hill <span class="accented">is not found</span> for us - that is, is not sufficient (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-9.htm">Numbers 11:9</a>.2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-10.htm">Zechariah 10:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the valley of Jezreel.</span> Rather, in the valley of Jezreel. The word for valley in this verse is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> (see note on Joshua 8:13). Jezreel abutted on the great plain of Esdraelon, a name which is but a corruption of Jezreel (see note on Joshua 19:18), where the chariots of iron could be used with effect, a thing impossible in the mountain districts. Hence the fact that the hill country of Palestine was more rapidly and permanently occupied than the plains (see Ewald, 'History,' 22 C., and Ritter's 'Geography of Palestine,' 2:328. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>, and note on Joshua 11:6). Here, once more, we have a proof that we have real history before us, and not a collection of poetic myths. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Boundaries and extent of the inheritance of the ten families of Manasseh. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7-10</a>, the southern boundary, which coincides with the northern boundary of Ephraim described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6-8</a>, and is merely given here with greater precision in certain points. It went "from Asher to Michmethah, before Shechem." Asher is not the territory of the tribe of Asher, but a distinct locality; according to the Onom. (s. v. Asher) a place on the high road from Neapolis to Scythopolis, fifteen Roman miles from the former. It is not to be found, however, in the ruins of Tell Um el Aschera (V. de Velde) or Tell Um Ajra (Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 310, 327), an hour to the south of Beisan, as Knobel supposes, but in the village of Yasir, where there are magnificent ruins, about five hours and ten minutes from Nabulus on the road to Beisan (V. de Velde, Mem. pp. 237, 289; R. ii. p. 295). Michmethah, before Shechem, is still unknown (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>). Shechem was founded by the Hivite prince Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>), and is frequently mentioned in the book of Genesis. It stood between Ebal and Gerizim, was given up by Ephraim to the Levites, and declared a free city (city of refuge: <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>). It was there that the ten tribes effected their separation from Judah <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1</a>.), and Jeroboam resided there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>). In later times it was the chief city of the country of Samaria, and the capital of the Samaritans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>); and the name of Neapolis, or Flavia Neapolis, from which the present Nabulus or Nablus has come, was given to it in honour of Vespasian (see v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 161ff.). From this point the boundary went &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; (i.e., either "to the right side," the south side, or to Yamin), "To the inhabitants of En-tappuah." Whether Yamin is an appellative or a proper name is doubtful. But even if it be the name of a place, it is quite certain that it cannot be the village of Yamn, an hour to the south-east of Taanuk (Rob. iii. pp. 161, 167, etc.), as this is much too far north, and, judging from <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>, belonged to the territory of Asher. In the case of En-tappuah, the inhabitants are mentioned instead of the district, because the district belonged to Manasseh, whilst the town on the border of Manasseh was given to the Ephraimites. The situation of the town has not yet been discovered: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a>. From this point the boundary ran down to the Cane-brook (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a>), namely to the south side of the brook.<p>"These towns were assigned to Ephraim in the midst of the towns of Manasseh, and (but) the territory of Manasseh was on the north of the brook." The only possible meaning of these words is the following: From Tappuah, the boundary went down to the Cane-brook and crossed it, so that the south side of the brook really belonged to the territory of Manasseh; nevertheless the towns on this south side were allotted to Ephraim, whilst only the territory to the north of the brook fell to the lot of the Manassites. This is expressed more plainly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a>: "To the south (of the brook the land came) to Ephraim, and to the north to Manasseh." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a> the northern and eastern boundaries are only briefly indicated: "And they (the Manassites) touched Asher towards the north, and Issachar towards the east." The reason why this boundary was not described more minutely, was probably because it had not yet been fixed. For (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>) Manasseh also received towns and districts in (within the territory of) Issachar and Asher, viz., Beth-shean, etc. Beth-shean, to the wall of which Saul's body was fastened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12</a>), was afterwards called Scythopolis. It was in the valley of the Jordan, where the plain of Jezreel slopes off into the valley; its present name is Beisan, a place where there are considerable ruins of great antiquity, about two hours from the Jordan (vid., Seetzen, ii. pp. 162ff.; Rob. iii. p. 174; Bibl. Res. p. 325; v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 150-1). This city, with its daughter towns, was in the territory of Issachar, which was on the east of Manasseh, and may have extended a considerable distance towards the south along the valley of the Jordan, as the territory of Manasseh and Ephraim did not run into the valley of the Jordan; but Asher (Yasir) is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a> as the most easterly place in Manasseh, and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6-7</a>, the eastern boundary of Ephraim ran down along the eastern edge of the mountains as far as Jericho, without including the Jordan valley. At the same time, the Ghor on the western side of the Jordan below Beisan, as far as the plain of Jericho, was of no great value to any tribe, as this district, according to Josephus (de Bell. Jud. iv. 8, 2, and iii. 10, 7), was uninhabited because of its barrenness. The other towns, Ibleam, etc., with the exception of Endor perhaps, were in the territory of Asher, and almost all on the south-west border of the plain of Esdraelon. Ibleam, called Bileam in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-55.htm">1 Chronicles 6:55</a> (70), a Levitical town (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-25.htm">Joshua 21:25</a>), was not very far from Megiddo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>), and has probably been preserved in the ruins of Khirbet-Belameh, half an hour to the south of Jenin; according to Schultz, it is the same place as Belamon, Belmen, or Belthem (Judith 4:4; 7:3; 8:3). With &#1491;&#1488;&#1512; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; the construction changes, so that there is an anacolouthon, which can be explained, however, on the ground that &#1500; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; may not only mean to be assigned to, but also to receive or to have. In this last sense &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; is attached. The inhabitants are mentioned instead of the towns, because the historian had already the thought present in his mind, that the Manassites were unable to exterminate the Canaanites from the towns allotted to them. Dor is the present Tortura (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>). Endor, the home of the witch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>), four Roman miles to the south of Tabor (Onom.), at present a village called Endr, on the northern shoulder of the Duhy or Little Hermon (see Rob. iii. p. 225; Bibl. Res. p. 340). Taanach and Megiddo, the present Taanuk and Lejun (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>). The three last towns, with the places dependent upon them, are connected more closely together by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, the three-hill-country, probably because they formed a common league.</body></html>
