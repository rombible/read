A strong wall was carried round the summit … and on this wall the bodies of Saul and his sons were fastened by the Philistines after the battle of Gilboa, and this supposition enables us to understand how the men of Jabesh-Gilead could execute their daring project of carrying them away. Jabesh-Gilead was on the mountain east of the Jordan, in full view of Beth-shean, and these brave men could creep up to the tell, along <span class="ital">Wady Jalûd</span>, without being seen, while the deafening roar of the brook would render it impossible for them to be heard.” In Solomon’s time it appears to have given its name to a district, and “all Beth-shan” was placed under one of his commissariat officers.

The declivity of the mountain is everywhere perforated with caves, and most of the habitations are merely walls built round the entrances to them. It was one of these caves, which “the witch of Endor” inhabited, whither came King Saul, crossing in his agony of despair the shoulder of the very hill, on which the Philistines were entrenched, to consult her before the disastrous battle of Gilboa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm" title="Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.

It was a "noble city" in the days of Eusebius and Jerome. Many travellers have remarked on its splendid situation, "in this vast area of plain and mountains, in the midst of abundant waters and exuberant fertility" (Robinson, 'Later Bibl. Res.' sec. 7). "Just beyond, and separated by a narrow ridge, is another stream, also perennial, and on the peninsular formed by these two, with a bold, steep brow overlooking the Ghor, stood the citadel of ancient Beth-shean - a sort of Gibraltar on a small scale - of remarkable natural strength, and inaccessible to horsemen. No wonder that it was long ere Israel could wrest it from the Canaanites. The eastern face rises like a steep cone, most incorrectly stated by Robinson to be 'black, and apparently volcanic;' and by Porter, 'probably a crater.' Certainly there are many blocks of basalt lying about, but the hill is simply a limestone bluff." (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 501). He goes on, "How clearly the details of the sad end of Saul were recalled as we stood on this spot" (the summit of the cone). "There was the slope of Gilboa, on which his army was encamped before the battle. Round that hill he slunk by night, conscience stricken, to visit the witch of Endor. Hither, as being a Canaanitish fortress, the Philistines most naturally brought the trophies of the royal slain, and hung them up just by this wall. By the Yasir, and across that plain below us, the gallant men of Jabesh-Gilead hurried on their long night's march to stop the indignity offered to Israel, and to take down the bodies of their king and his sons." Jabesh-Gilead was not far off, and though in full view of the mountain, yet the men of Jabesh could creep along the Ghor by night and climb the steep face of the rock unsuspected by the warriors above; while the roar of the brook would drown all the sounds they might make (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' p. 454). <span class="cmt_word">And her towns.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">daughters</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> LXX.; <span class="accented">viculi</span>, Vulgate. Canon Tristram remarks how each hill in some parts of Palestine is crowned by a village, a number of which still cluster, as of old, round the chief city of the district. So in Italy we may see how times of unsettlement led to a similar policy. The fear of the northern pirates led to the planting the mediaeval towns on hills, and the disturbed state of the country kept them there till a comparatively late period. But many of them are deserted in this more peaceful age. Ibleam. Only known as near the place where Jehu gave Ahaziah his death blow. It was near Megiddo (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>). Dor (see above <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>). Keil thinks that Dor and all the cities after it are in the accusative to "could not drive out" in the next verse. But it is more probable that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> was an anacolouthon. Vandevelde ('Travels,' 1:333) says that he did not wonder that the fainthearted Manassites shrank from attacking Dor when he saw its formidable position, ruder. This, the abode of the famous witch, still bears the old name. It is four miles south of Mount Tabor, in a country honeycombed with caves, and it stands on the shoulder of Little Hermon. The word signifies the "fount of Dor," or "the dwelling." Taanach. For this and Megiddo see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>. Three countries. Rather, three <span class="accented">hills</span>, or elevated spots (Napheth, see note, ch. 11:2). Gesenius compares the name Temont. The reference is to Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo. Keil suggests <span class="accented">province</span>, but he does not explain how a derivative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> can have this latter signification (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>. Beautiful for its height (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;</span>) is Mount Zion). The LXX. and Vulgate regard it as a proper name, and translate, "the third part of Nopheth." They are puzzled by the expression here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Among the six families of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a>), Zelophehad, a descendant of Hepher, left no son; but he had five daughters, whose names are given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-33.htm">Numbers 26:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-10.htm">Numbers 36:10</a>).
