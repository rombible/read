Or the sense may be, though Ephraim was to be more potent and numerous than Manasseh, according to the prophecy of Jacob, yet this should be no prejudice to Manasseh, nor deprive him of any privilege to which he might lay claim as the elder. “Both being sons of Joseph, drew but one lot; and their estates and cities were in some degree mixed together; but after having described the portion of the lot which fell to Ephraim, it was proper in like manner to describe the portion of his brother, as being the first born.” — Dodd. <span class="ital">For Machir — </span>The only son of Manasseh, who, therefore, is here put for the whole tribe. <span class="ital">The firstborn — </span>So even only sons are sometimes called, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>. <span class="ital">Because he was a man of war — </span>That is, had given great proof of his valour, (though the particular history be not mentioned,) and his posterity were no degenerate sons, but had his valiant blood still running in their veins. <span class="ital">Gilead and Bashan — </span>Part of those countries; for part of them was given to the Reubenites, and part to the Gadites.

"Father" here means lord or possessor of Gilead. This view is confirmed by the fact that it was not Machir, but his descendants, who subdued Gilead and Bashan (Nu 32:41; De 3:13-15). These Machirites had their portion on the east side of Jordan. The western portion of land, allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, was divided into ten portions because the male descendants who had sons consisted of five families, to which, consequently, five shares were given; and the sixth family, namely, the posterity of Hepher, being all women, the five daughters of Zelophehad were, on application to the valuators, endowed each with an inheritance in land (see on [197]Nu 27:4).The inheritance of Manasseh, and its borders, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/17-1.htm" title="There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan....">Joshua 17:1-11</a></span>.

As well as for the tribe of Ephraim: <p>for he was the firstborn of Joseph; and therefore ought to have his part and share in the lot of the children of Joseph, though Ephraim was preferred before him in the blessing of Jacob. Some think this is given as a reason why he had a double portion, one on the other side Jordan, and another in the land of Canaan: <p>to wit, for Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead; who was the only son of Manasseh, and so through him, and by his son Gilead, the whole tribe sprung from that patriarch: and <p>because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan; which were given to his posterity by Moses, and lay on the other side Jordan, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>. This Machir very likely had shown his warlike disposition and courage in Egypt, and had fought under the kings there against the common enemy of that country; for it is highly probable he was dead before the children of Israel came out from thence, but the same warlike spirit continued in his posterity; they had their part assigned them on the other side Jordan, to defend that country, while the tribes of Reuben and Gad attended to the care of their flocks and herds. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/17-1.htm" title="There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan....">Joshua 17:1-6</a>.

Jair captured the whole of the tract of Argob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>), and in addition took possession of some nomad villages in Gilead, which he called after his own name, <span class="ital">Havoth-Jair</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm" title="And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-23.htm" title="And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair, from them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, even three score cities.

Nobah possessed himself of the town of Kenath and the hamlets dependent upon it, and gave them his own name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-42.htm" title="And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.">Numbers 32:42</a>). For the territory of the half tribe of Manasseh east of the Jordan, see above, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/13-29.htm" title="And Moses gave inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families....">Joshua 13:29-32</a>.

The name signifies the physical aspect of the country = a “hard rocky region.” It extended from the parallel of the south end of the Sea of Galilee to that of the north end of the Dead Sea, about 60 miles, and its average breadth scarcely exceeded 20.

They were sufficient to occupy the land of Gilead and Bashan, extensive and powerful though it was, while the rest of the tribe had a share in the inheritance westward of Jordan (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For he was the firstborn of Joseph.</span> There has been much discussion why these words were introduced. It is probable that they are intended as an explanation of the existence of Ephraim and Manasseh as separate tribes; or possibly this is introduced to suggest the reason for mentioning the tribes in this order since Ephraim was not the firstborn (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The father of Gilead.</span> There seems no reason to accept Keil's <span class="accented">dictum</span>, that because Gilead here has the article, whereas in other places where it signifies Machir's son it has not, the country and not the man is meant, and "father" must be taken as equivalent to "lord." The usage is found in Arabic and Ethiopic, but not in Hebrew. The reason why Gilead as the name of the individual has the article here is most likely because he gave his name to the territory mentioned immediately afterwards. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he had.</span> There is no "therefore" in the original, where we find "and he had." We must understand this as spoken of the tribe, not personally of Machir, who had been long dead (see note on Joshua 6:25). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Territory of the tribe of Ephraim, according to its families. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>. "The border of their inheritance was from the east Atroth-addar and (along the line) to Upper Beth-horon," - a brief description of the southern boundary, which is more minutely described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1-3</a>. Upper Beth-horon is mentioned here instead of Lower Beth-horon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>). This makes no difference, however, as the two places stood quite close to one another (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6-8</a> the northern boundary of Ephraim is given, namely, from the middle, or from "a central point near the watershed" (Knobel), first towards the east (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-7.htm">Joshua 16:7</a>), and then towards the west (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a>). The eastern half of the northern boundary went &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., when regarded from the west, or looked at towards the west, to the north side of Michmethah. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>, this place was before Shechem, and therefore in any case it was not far from it, though it has not been discovered yet. Knobel supposes it to have been on the site of the present Kabate (Seetzen, ii. p. 166), Kubatiyeh, an hour and a half to the south of Jenin (Rob. iii. 154), assuming that Michmethah might also have been pronounced Chemathah, and that &#1489; may have been substituted for &#1502;. But Kabate is six hours to the north of Shechem, and therefore was certainly not "before Shechem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>). It then turned "eastward to Taanath-shiloh" (&#x3a4;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#768;&#x3b8; &#x3a3;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;, lxx), according to the Onom. (s. v. Thenath) ten Roman miles from Neapolis (Sichem), on the way to the Jordan, most probably the Thena of Ptol. (v. 16, 5), the present Tana, Ain Tana, a heap of ruins on the south-east of Nabulus, where there are large cisterns to be found (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 295; Ritter, Erdk. xv. p. 471). And "then went by on the east to Janoah" (i.e., Jano in Acrabittena regione, twelve Roman miles from Neapolis: Onom.), the present ruins of Jann, a miserable village, with extensive ruins of great antiquity, about three hours to the south-east of Nabulus, three-quarters of an hour to the north-east of Akrabeh (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 297; Van de Velde, R. ii. p. 268). </body></html>
