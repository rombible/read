The daughters of Zelophehad now reaped the benefit of their pious zeal and prudent forecast. Those who take care in the wilderness of this world, to make sure to themselves a place in the inheritance of the saints in light, will have the comfort of it in the other world; while those who neglect it now, will lose it for ever. Lord, teach us here to believe and obey, and give us an inheritance among thy saints, in glory everlasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the rest ... - i. e. for those who were not settled on the east of Jordan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 17<p>Jos 17:1-6.

There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh&#8212;Ephraim was mentioned, as the more numerous and powerful branch of the family of Joseph (Ge 48:19, 20); but Manasseh still retained the right of primogeniture and had a separate inheritance assigned.<p>Machir&#8212;his descendants.<p>the father of Gilead&#8212;Though he had a son of that name (Nu 26:29; 27:1), yet, as is evident from the use of the Hebrew article, reference is made, not to the person, but the province of Gilead. "Father" here means lord or possessor of Gilead. This view is confirmed by the fact that it was not Machir, but his descendants, who subdued Gilead and Bashan (Nu 32:41; De 3:13-15). These Machirites had their portion on the east side of Jordan. The western portion of land, allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, was divided into ten portions because the male descendants who had sons consisted of five families, to which, consequently, five shares were given; and the sixth family, namely, the posterity of Hepher, being all women, the five daughters of Zelophehad were, on application to the valuators, endowed each with an inheritance in land (see on [197]Nu 27:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">No sons, but daughters; </span> of whom <span class="bld">see Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-33.htm" title="And Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters: and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 26:33</a>"</span>; <span class="bld">see Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm" title="Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 27:1</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters,....

The inheritance here described as being given to the daughters of Zelophehad was so given on condition of their marrying within the limits of their own tribe, a condition which was fulfilled. Thus the name of Zelophehad, and the portion of land belonging to him, was not blotted out from the memory of his descendants. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From Janoah the boundary went down "to Ataroth and Naarath," Ataroth, a different place from the Ataroth or Atroth-addar mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>, is apparently to be sought for on the eastern slope of the mountains by the side of the Ghor, judging from the expression "went down;" but it has not yet been discovered. Naarath, probably the same as Naaran, in eastern Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-28.htm">1 Chronicles 7:28</a>), is described in the Onom. (s. v. Naaratha) as viculus Judaeorum Naorath, five Roman miles (i.e., two hours) from Jericho, probably on the north-east. The boundary line then touched Jericho, i.e., the district of Jericho, namely on the north side of the district, as Jericho was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a>). At this point it also coincided with the southern boundary of the tribe of Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>) and the northern boundary of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-12.htm">Joshua 18:12</a>). </body></html>
