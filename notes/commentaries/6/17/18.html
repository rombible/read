Joshua tells them, that what was fallen to their share would be a sufficient lot for them, if they would but work and fight. Men excuse themselves from labour by any pretence; and nothing serves the purpose better than having rich and powerful relations, able to provide for them; and they are apt to desire a partial and unfaithful disposal of what is intrusted to those they think able to give such help. But there is more real kindness in pointing out the advantages within reach, and in encouraging men to make the best of them, than in granting indulgences to sloth and extravagance. True religion gives no countenance to these evils. The rule is, They shall not eat who will not work; and many of our cannots are only the language of idleness, which magnifies every difficulty and danger. This is especially the case in our spiritual work and warfare. Without Christ we can do nothing, but we are apt to sit still and attempt nothing. if we belong to Him, he will stir us up to our best endeavours, and to cry to him for help. Then our coast will be enlarged, 1Ch 4:9,10, and complainings silenced, or rather, turned into joyful thanksgivings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt not have one lot only - i. e. by dispossessing the Canaanites, thou shalt double the portion of land at thy disposal.

None of the tribes of Israel can compete with thee in strength! Use it then, and thou wilt gain not only the mountain, but the “outgoings” beyond, and as at the waters of Merom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-7.htm" title="So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell on them.">Joshua 11:7</a>), the iron chariots and the military strength of thy foes will avail them nothing. “The long range of mountains running from Carmel south-eastward across central Palestine appeared like a frowning rampart defended by Canaanite foes.” But this was the very reason why the great house of Joseph should prove themselves worthy of their great power by scaling that rampart. It is plain from this passage that “at the time of the Israelitish invasion the mountains of Gilboa and the country adjacent were covered with dense forests, of which not a trace now remains, and which made them a more secure asylum for those who sought protection, than open fields could be. And it seems to have been a shrewd device of the great Hebrew chieftain, the counselling the descendants of Joseph to go up into the mountain land; for it would lead to the laying bare of the whole country, and would compel the adjacent inhabitants to come out from their places of refuge, and make open resistance to the invaders.” Ritter, ii. 328. Observe in the discontent now expressed by the “house of Joseph,” the mutterings of the louder complaints we afterwards hear them making against Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/8-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites?

When cleared it would afford them more space. But Joshua also recommends them to extend their operations beyond its borders, as is clear from the mention of the "plain," and the "chariots of iron" (see next note). <span class="cmt_word">The outgoings.</span> Not only the mountain itself, but the country to which the mountain passes led. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt drive out.</span> Perhaps <span class="accented">thou mayest drive out - i.e.</span>, it is in thy power. <span class="cmt_word">Though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.</span> "No weapon can prosper" against him who trusts in the Lord. Yet, in spite of the encouragement given by Joshua, the children of Joseph did not drive the Canaanites out, as vers. 11-13 show. The only reason of this was that they did not trust in Gad, but preferred an unworthy compromise with neighbours who, however rich in warlike material, were sunk in sensuality and sloth. Keil would render "because" for "though," and regard the very fact of the strength of the Canaanites as the reason that the sons of Joseph would subdue them. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-17.htm">Psalm 49:17</a> supply us with other instances of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. in the sense of although, which certainly is the best sense here. "Let it be remembered how long it was before the Saxons were firmly established in Britain, the Islamite Arabs in Egypt. Israel could look for no reinforcements from kindred left behind. So much the worse might afterwards be the position of the nation, left alone without hope of kindred auxiliaries to meet the repeated outbreaks of the half-subdued Canaanites" (Ewald, 'Hist. Israel,' 2 2. c.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Manassites were unable to exterminate the Canaanites from these six towns, and the districts round; but when they grew stronger, they made them tributary slaves (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>). </body></html>
