Though each tribe had its inheritance, yet they should intermix one with another, to do good offices one to another, as became those, who, though of different tribes, were all one Israel, and were bound to love as brethren. But they suffered the Canaanites to live among them, against the command of God, to serve their own ends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Asher - Not the tribe so called, but a place somewhere toward the eastern end of the boundary line here drawn: perhaps "Teyasir," on the road from Sichem to Beth-shean. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 17:7-11.

This remark is introduced with the words "for he was the first-born of Joseph." On this account, in addition to the territory already given to him in Gilead and Bashan, he received a second allotment of territory in Canaan proper. With the word &#1500;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; (for Machir) the more minute account of the division of the Manassites commences. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; is first of all written absolutely at the beginning of the sentence, and then resumed in &#1500;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;: "to Machir, the first-born of Manasseh ... to him were Gilead and Bashan assigned, because he was a man of war," i.e., a warlike man, and had earned for himself a claim to the inheritance of Gilead and Bashan through the peculiar bravery which he had displayed in the conquest of those lands. By Machir, however, we are not to understand the actual son of Manasseh, but his family; and &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497; does not mean "father of Gilead," but lord (possessor) of Gilead, for Machir's son Gilead is always called &#1490;&#1500;&#1506;&#1491; without the article (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-1.htm">Numbers 36:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>), whereas the country of that name is just as constantly called &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1491; (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a>, the last clause, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-5.htm">Joshua 17:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-11.htm">Joshua 13:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-31.htm">Joshua 13:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>.). "And there came, i.e., the lot fell (the lot is to be repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a>), to the other descendants of Manasseh according to their families," which are then enumerated as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-30.htm">Numbers 26:30-32</a>. "These are the male descendants of Manasseh." &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; must not be altered, notwithstanding the fact that it is preceded and followed by &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; it is evidently used deliberately as an antithesis to the female descendants of Manasseh mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>.</body></html>
