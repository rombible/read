The <span class="ital">Asher</span> here spoken of is not the tribe of Asher, but a city on the east of Shechem. Eusebius places it on the road from Shechem to Bethshean. “Three quarters of an hour from <span class="ital">Tûbâs</span> is the hamlet of <span class="ital">Teyâsîr</span>, which may probably be identified with Asher, a town of Manasseh.” Porter’s <span class="ital">Handbook</span>, ii. 348.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to Michmethah</span>] See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm" title="And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward to Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;">Joshua 16:6</a>.

Rather, <span class="accented">border. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Asher</span>. This has been supposed not to be the <span class="accented">tribe</span> of Asher, for this was on the north, but a city which has been identified with the modern Yasir, about five hours' distance from Nablous, or Neapolis, on the road to Beisan,or Beth-shean, where, says Delitzsch, there are "magnificent ruins" now to be seen. See, however, note ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">Michmethah</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>). This place has not been identified. All we know is that it is opposite (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) Shechem. Some have thought that this is simply the denominative of Asher, to distinguish it from the tribe, and that for "Asher to Michmethah" we should read "Asher-ham-Michmethah." But this could hardly be the Yasir above, since it is opposite Shechem. <span class="cmt_word">Shechem</span>. Now Nablous. This place is famous both in the Old and the New Testament. We first read of it, under the name of Sichem, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>. It was the abode of Shechem and Hamor his son, when Jacob abode in Canaan after his return from Padan-aram. It was situated between Gerizim and Ebal, and became an important city in the days of the Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>.). It was destroyed by Abimelech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-45.htm">Judges 9:45</a>), but it seems to have recovered. It was thither that Rehoboam went to be crowned, and there that his injudicious answer alienated forever the ten tribes from his rule. Jeroboam made it his capital and is said to have "built" it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>). He afterwards, however, abandoned it for Penuel, and Penuel again apparently for Tirzah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>), and Tirzah for Jezreel, which remained the capital until Omri built Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It is no doubt the Sychar mentioned in St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4.htm">John 4</a>. Most travelers have admired the picturesque situation of Shechem. It has even extorted a tribute from Dr. Peterman, in his 'Reisen im Orient,' a work which, however full of valuable information regarding the condition and customs of the people, does not abound m description of scenery. He becomes almost poetical as he speaks of this town, resting on the slopes of Gerizim, a mountain fruitful to its summit, and having opposite the bare, stony el Ebal, its outline unrelieved by verdure, the haunt of jackals, whose howls, like the cry of wailing children in distress, disturb the silence of the night. Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 470) thus describes the scene: "A valley green with grass, grey with olives, gardens sloping down on each side, fresh springs rushing down in all directions; at the end a white town embosomed in all this verdure lodged between the two high mountains which extend on each side of the valley; this is the aspect of Nablous, the most beautiful, perhaps it might be said the only beautiful, spot in Central Palestine. Thirty-two springs can be traced in different parts. Here the bilbul delights to sit and sing, and thousands of other birds delight to swell the chorus." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Before proceeding to the more detailed description of the inheritance, the historian thinks it necessary to observe that the Manassites received a double inheritance. This remark is introduced with the words "for he was the first-born of Joseph." On this account, in addition to the territory already given to him in Gilead and Bashan, he received a second allotment of territory in Canaan proper. With the word &#1500;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; (for Machir) the more minute account of the division of the Manassites commences. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; is first of all written absolutely at the beginning of the sentence, and then resumed in &#1500;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;: "to Machir, the first-born of Manasseh ... to him were Gilead and Bashan assigned, because he was a man of war," i.e., a warlike man, and had earned for himself a claim to the inheritance of Gilead and Bashan through the peculiar bravery which he had displayed in the conquest of those lands. By Machir, however, we are not to understand the actual son of Manasseh, but his family; and &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497; does not mean "father of Gilead," but lord (possessor) of Gilead, for Machir's son Gilead is always called &#1490;&#1500;&#1506;&#1491; without the article (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-1.htm">Numbers 36:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>), whereas the country of that name is just as constantly called &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1491; (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a>, the last clause, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-5.htm">Joshua 17:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-11.htm">Joshua 13:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-31.htm">Joshua 13:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>.). "And there came, i.e., the lot fell (the lot is to be repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a>), to the other descendants of Manasseh according to their families," which are then enumerated as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-30.htm">Numbers 26:30-32</a>. "These are the male descendants of Manasseh." &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; must not be altered, notwithstanding the fact that it is preceded and followed by &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; it is evidently used deliberately as an antithesis to the female descendants of Manasseh mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>.</body></html>
