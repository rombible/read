God impressed these fears on the Canaanites, and dispirited them. This gave a short rest to the Israelites, and circumcision rolled away the reproach of Egypt.

It does not seem that a new name was given to the place now; but rather that a new meaning and significancy were attached to the old name, the word <span class="ital">Gilgal</span> denoting a “circle,” and also a “rolling away.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The reproach of Egypt.</span> Either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the reproach which comes from the Egyptians, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the reproach of having sojourned in Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Keil incorrectly states that" the genitive <span class="accented">always</span> denotes the person from whom the reproach comes" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>, "the reproach of thy widowhood," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the reproach which is cast upon thee for being a widow; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-30.htm">Ezekiel 36:30</a>, "reproach of famine," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the reproach which comes from being doomed to suffer famine). If we accept <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we must refer the phrase to the reproach cast upon the Israelites by the Egyptians, that all their vain glorious boasts were worthless, and that they were never destined to occupy the land which they declared God had given to them. Hengstenberg ('Geschichte des Retches Gottes,' p. 207) regards it strangely as the reproach the Egyptians cast upon them that they were rejected of God. If <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it must be regarded as equivalent to the reproach that they were a nation of slaves, a reproach that was rolled away by the fact of their standing as freemen on the soil which had been promised to their fathers. But Knobel supposes <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it was their down-trodden miserable condition in Egypt, a condition which was only partially ameliorated during their wanderings in the wilderness, in the course of which, accustomed to a settled existence, they must have had much to endure. "With the arrival in Canaan," he adds, "all this came to an end. All those who had deserved punishment were dead, all the uncircumcised were circumcised, reproach and misery were put aside, and Israel, as the worthy community of God, entered on a new life." This interpretation, more precise and clear than (2), best satisfies all the requirements of the passage. Some have regarded their uncircumcised state as the "reproach of Egypt." But this, as Hengstenberg remarks, could hardly be, for none but the Egyptian priests were circumcised. Origen (Horn. 4, 'Lib. Jesu Nave') teaches the following lesson from this passage: "Fuimus enim nos aliquando insipientes, increduli, errantes, servientes desideriis et voluptatibus varlis, in malitiam, et invidia, odibiles, odientes invicem. Non tibi videntur haec opprobia esse, et opprobia AEgypti? Sed ex quo venit Christus, et dedit nobis secundam circumcisionem per baptismum regenerationis, et purgavit animas nostras, abjecimus haec omnia." And again, speaking of the spiritual circumcision Christians have received, and the obligation to purity thus imposed, he adds, "Jam tibi enim non licet templo Dei uti, nisi in sanctitate, nec membra Christi ad iudignum dare negotium ... Si quando te malae concupiscentiae pulsat illecebra...  dic non sum meus, enitus enim sum pretio sanguinis Christi, et membrum ipsius effectus sum." Theodoret remarks how the Israelites who had been circumcised perished in the wilderness, while their uncircumcised children were miraculously preserved and brought over Jordan. A remarkable commentary this on the words, "Now circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm">1 Corinthians 7:19</a>). He also remarks that "we may here learn how we, who have received spiritual circumcision, thereby laid aside the reproach of sin." Trusting by nature in the spiritual Egypt, the house of bondage, we are slaves to sin and corruption. When we enter into fellowship with Christ, the reproach of Egypt is rolled away, and we enjoy "the glorious liberty of the children of God" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-32.htm">John 8:32-36</a>). Gilgal. It is quite possible, since the word to roll is in Hebrew, as indeed in English, spoken of a circular motion and since <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is a wheel in Hebrew, that the place, like Geliloth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, circles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a>), originally meant a circle, and that the new signification was attached to the name from this moment.
