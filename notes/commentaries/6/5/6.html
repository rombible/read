Oh that they would now take warning, and before it be too late, flee for refuge to lay hold upon that hope set before them in the gospel! God impressed these fears on the Canaanites, and dispirited them. This gave a short rest to the Israelites, and circumcision rolled away the reproach of Egypt. They were hereby owned to be the free-born children of God, having the seal of the covenant. When God glorifies himself in perfecting the salvation of his people, he not only silences all enemies, but rolls back their reproaches upon themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of the whole nation those only were already circumcised at the time of the passage of the Jordan who had been under twenty years of age at the time of the complaining and consequent rejection at Kadesh (compare the marginal reference). These would have been circumcised before they left Egypt, and there would still survive of them more than a quarter of a million of thirty-eight years old and upward.<p>The statements of these verses are of a general kind. The "forty years" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-6.htm">Joshua 5:6</a> is a round number, and the statement in the latter part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5</a> cannot be strictly accurate. For there must have been male children born in the wilderness during the first year after the Exodus, and these must have been circumcised before the celebration of the Passover at Sinai in the first month of the second year (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-1.htm">Numbers 9:1-5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>). The statements of the verses are, however, sufficiently close to the facts for the purpose in hand; namely, to render a reason for the general circumcising which is here recorded.<p>The reason why circumcision was omitted in the wilderness, was that the sentence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28</a> ff placed the whole nation for the time under a ban; and that the discontinuance of circumcision, and the consequent omission of the Passover, was a consequence and a token of that ban. The rejection was not, indeed, total, for the children of the complainers were to enter into the rest; nor final, for when the children had borne the punishment of the fathers' sins for the appointed years, and the complainers were dead, then it was to be removed, as now by Joshua. But for the time the covenant was abrogated, though God's purpose to restore it was from the first made known, and confirmed by the visible marks of His favor which He still vouchsafed to bestow during the wandering. The years of rejection were indeed exhausted before the death of Moses (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14</a>): but God would not call upon the people to renew their engagement to Him until He had first given them glorious proof of His will and power to fulfill His engagements to them. So He gave them the first fruits of the promised inheritance - the kingdoms of Sihon and Og; and through a miracle planted their feet on the very soil that still remained to be conquered; and then recalled them to His covenant. It is to be noted, too, that they were just about to go to war against foes mightier than themselves. Their only hope of success lay in the help of God. At such a crisis the need of full communion with God would be felt indeed; and the blessing and strength of it are accordingly granted.<p>The revival of the two great ordinances - circumcision and the Passover - after so long an intermission could not but awaken the zeal and invigorate the faith and fortitude of the people. Both as seals and as means of grace and God's good purpose toward them then, the general circumcision of the people, followed up by the solemn celebration of the Passover - the one formally restoring the covenant and reconciling them nationally to God, the other ratifying and confirming all that circumcision intended - were at this juncture most opportune. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-7. this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise&#8212;The omission to circumcise the children born in the wilderness might have been owing to the incessant movements of the people; but it is most generally thought that the true cause was a temporary suspension of the covenant with the unbelieving race who, being rejected of the Lord, were doomed to perish in the wilderness, and whose children had to bear the iniquity of their fathers (Nu 14:33), though, as the latter were to be brought into the promised land, the covenant would be renewed with them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All the people; </span> the Hebrew word commonly signifies the Gentiles; so he calls them, to note that they were unworthy of the name and privileges of Israelites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He would not show them, </span> i.e. not give them so much as a sight of it, which he granted to Moses, much less the possession and enjoyment of it.

Both articles were abundantly produced in Canaan, even in a state of devastation. Milk, eaten partly sweet and partly curdled, that of cows as well as of goats and sheep (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm" title="Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and you did drink the pure blood of the grape.">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>), was prominent in the diet of the ancient Hebrews, as in that of the Orientals of the present day. The land yielded great quantities of honey also, especially that from wild bees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-8.htm" title="And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.">Jdg 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-26.htm" title="And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.">1 Samuel 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>), and still yields it in its wasted condition.” Keil.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Till all the people.</span> The Hebrew here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d9;</span>, not the usual word for people, but that usually applied to the Gentiles (equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, by which word it is usually rendered in the LXX.). It is applied to the Israelites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>. In the singular it means a people in the more general sense, a nation, as distinguished from a people in whom one has an interest. In the plural it always means the Gentiles. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span>. (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), the word usually applied to the people of God, is not used here, because the people who "provoked God in the wilderness" had made themselves in a sense a rejected people. Delitzsch regards this (after Calvin) as a sign that, for the time at least, the covenant between God and Israel was annulled, permanently in the case of those who were condemned to die in the wilderness, temporarily only in their descendants, who were formally reconciled to God, and restored to their former covenant position by this solemn performance of the covenant rite of circumcision (see note on verse 2). So also Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 205. The difficulty about the passover may be met by supposing that those only who were circumcised - a constantly decreasing number, of course - were allowed to celebrate that feast. Knobel would understand that in consequence of the "unquiet, unsettled, uncomfortable life" the Israelites led in the wilderness, they could keep very few of the ordained feasts. He continues: "the Elohist knows nothing of any cessation." Nevertheless we read of no passover being <span class="accented">kept</span> after the one recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-5.htm">Numbers 9:5</a>, so that if "the Elohist knows of no cessation," he knows as little of any continued observance of the feast. But there is no certainty on the point. Considering the loose way in which the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> is used in Scripture (see, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>), we need not press the word to include <span class="accented">all</span> who were born after the departure from Egypt, but only those who were born after the rejection of the people recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> This rejection, be it remembered, did not include all the Israelites who were born in Egypt, but only those who were over twenty years of age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a>). The view of Kurz (3:323, Clark's translation), that circumcision was suspended on account of the continual movements of the Israelites, is refuted by Delitzsch's remark that the Israelites were not continually on the march, but that they often encamped in one place for a long period, a period far longer, in fact, than the time in which they abode in Gilgal. Delitzsch asks why this circumcision did not take place before, why it was not performed as soon as they crossed the brook Zered. The answer is that, until the Jordan was crossed, they had not taken formal possession of their own land. As soon as, under the Divine protection, they had crossed the Jordan, the long-delayed promise was fulfilled. God's covenant with Abraham was accomplished, and now they, in their turn, had to place themselves once more in the position of God's covenant people, bound to serve Him with their whole heart. For a fuller discussion of this question see Keil's Commentary, and Hengstenberg in the passage cited above. We may observe that God fulfils His part of the covenant first, and then it is man's duty to fulfil his. God, under the Christian dispensation, first places us in the state of salvation. Then it becomes our duty to make that salvation sure by overcoming God's enemies, by the help which He never fails to afford. Give us. This introduction of the first person into the middle of the sentence is unexpected. Some MSS. and editors read "to them" (see note on ver. 1, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>, where there is a similar change of person). <span class="cmt_word">A land that floweth with milk and honey.</span> This, says Keil, "is a standing expression in the Pentateuch to express the great fertility of the land of Canaan. Milk and honey are produced by a land rich in grass and flowers, which were both of them plentiful in Canaan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15, 22</a>). Milk, not only of cows, but of sheep and goats also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>), and eaten sometimes sweet, at other times thick or curdled (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>), was a leading article of food amongst the ancient Hebrews, as it is in the present day in most Eastern countries, and Palestine was peculiarly fitted for the rearing of cattle. Honey also, especially that of wild bees, was found in large quantities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a>, sqq.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-26.htm">1 Samuel 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), and is still found, notwithstanding its present desolate condition." Some have thought <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> to mean the newly expressed juice of grapes, which, under the Arabic name of <span class="accented">dibs</span>, is largely used at present in Palestine, and is even exported to other countries.

The miracle itself, like the similar one at the Dead Sea, had a double intention, viz., to reveal to the Canaanites the omnipotence of the God of Israel, the strong hand of the Lord (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-18.htm">Exodus 14:18</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-6.htm">Joshua 6:6</a>; and for the expression "the hand of the Lord is mighty," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-1.htm">Exodus 6:1</a>, etc.), and to serve as an impulse to the Israelites to fear the Lord their God always (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>). </body></html>
