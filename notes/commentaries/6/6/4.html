It shut itself up, being strongly fortified both by art and nature. Thus were they foolish, and their hearts hardened to their destruction; the miserable case of all that strengthen themselves against the Almighty. God resolves Israel shall be its master, and that quickly. No warlike preparations were to be made. By the uncommon method of besieging the city, the Lord honoured the ark, as the symbol of his presence, and showed that all the victories were from him. The faith and patience of the people were proved and increased.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Trumpets of ram's horns - Render rather here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5-6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-8.htm">Joshua 6:8</a>, etc., "trumpets of jubilee" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a> note). The instrument is more correctly rendered "cornet" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>, note). Various attempts have been made to explain the fall of Jericho by natural causes, as, e. g., by the undermining of the walls, or by an earthquake, or by a sudden assault. But the narrative of this chapter does not afford the slightest warrant for any such explanations; indeed it is totally inconsistent with them. It must be taken as it stands; and so taken it intends, beyond all doubt, to narrate a miracle, or rather a series of miracles.<p>In the belief that a record is not necessarily unhistorical because it is miraculous, never perhaps was a miracle more needed than that which gave Jericho to Joshua. Its lofty walls and well-fenced gates made it simply impregnable to the Israelites - a nomad people, reared in the desert, destitute alike of the engines of war for assaulting a fortified town, and of skill and experience in the use of them if they had had them. Nothing line a direct interference of the Almighty could in a week's time give a city like Jericho, thoroughly on its guard and prepared (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a> ff and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>), to besiegers situated as were Joshua and the Israelites.<p>The fall of Jericho cogently taught the inhabitants of Canaan that the successes of Israel were not mere human triumphs of man against man, and that the God of Israel was not as "the gods of the countries." This lesson some of them at least learned to their salvation, e. g., Rahab and the Gibeonites. Further, ensuing close upon the miraculous passage of Jordan, it was impressed on the people, prone ever to be led by the senses, that the same God who had delivered their fathers out of Egypt and led them through the Red Sea, was with Joshua no less effectually than He had been with Moses.<p>And the details of the orders given by God to Joshua Jos 6:3-5 illustrate this last point further. The trumpets employed were not the silver trumpets used for signalling the marshalling of the host and for other warlike purposes (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a>), but the curved horns employed for ushering in the Jubilee and the Sabbatical Year (Septuagint, &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;  salpinges hierai: compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a> note). The trumpets were borne by priests, and were seven in number; the processions round Jericho were to be made on seven days, and seven times on the seventh day, thus laying a stress on the sacred number seven, which was an emhlem more especially of the work of God. The ark of God also, the seat of His special presence, was carried round the city. All these particulars were calculated to set forth symbolically, and in a mode sure to arrest the attention of the people, the fact that their triumph was wholly due to the might of the Lord, and to that covenant which made their cause His. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5. ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war. &#8230; Thus shalt thou do six days, &c.&#8212;Directions are here given as to the mode of procedure. Hebrew, "horns of jubilee"; that is, the bent or crooked trumpets with which the jubilee was proclaimed. It is probable that the horns of this animal were used at first; and that afterwards, when metallic trumpets were introduced, the primitive name, as well as form of them, was traditionally continued. The design of this whole proceeding was obviously to impress the Canaanites with a sense of the divine omnipotence, to teach the Israelites a memorable lesson of faith and confidence in God's promises, and to inspire sentiments of respect and reverence for the ark as the symbol of His presence. The length of time during which those circuits were made tended the more intensely to arrest the attention, and to deepen the impressions, both of the Israelites and the enemy. The number seven was among the Israelites the symbolic seal of the covenant between God and their nation [Keil, Hengstenberg].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of rams’ horns, </span> or, <span class="ital">of the jubilees</span>, i.e. such trumpets wherewith they were to sound in the years of jubilee, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-9.htm" title="Then shall you cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.">Leviticus 25:9</a></span>.

The ark was to be taken up and carried by priests round the city. Ben Gersom observes, that this was to direct the Israelites to keep and do according to all that was written in it; that is, in the law, which was contained in it; but no doubt the design of it was to show, that the subduing of Jericho, and the miracle that would be wrought, were owing to the power and presence of God, of which the ark was a symbol: and before it were to go seven other priests, with trumpets in their hands; which, according to our version, were made of rams horns: in the original it is "jobelim", or "jubilee" trumpets. Some think it means only such as they were to use in the year of jubilee; so Abarbinel and others, as Masius and Noldius (x); that they had their name from Jubal, the first inventor of musical instruments, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-21.htm">Genesis 4:21</a>; for rams' horns are objected to because they are solid, and not hollow; as if they could not be bored and made hollow, and fit for such a purpose. The Targum, Jarchi, and Kimchi, interpret the word by rams horns, as we do (y); and observe what R. Akiba said,"when (says he) I went into Arabia, I heard them call; a ram "jobel"; and the trumpet itself is called "jobel", because made of a ram's horn (z):" <p>and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times; in the same manner as on the other days: <p>and the priests shall blow with the trumpets; which they were to do; and did every day. <p>(x) P. 160.

Amongst the Hebrews seven days were appointed as the length of the Feasts of Passover and Tabernacles; seven days for the ceremonies of the consecration of priests; seven victims were to be offered on any special occasion; and at the ratification of a treaty, the notion of <span class="ital">seven</span> was embodied in the very term signifying to swear, literally meaning <span class="ital">to do seven times</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-28.htm" title="And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.">Genesis 21:28</a>). The number seven was thus impressed with the seal of sanctity as the symbol of all connected with the Deity, with the subordinate notions of perfection or completeness.

The LXX., which Calvin and our translators and the majority of commentators follow, regard this part of the sentence as stating what was to be done on the six days, and rightly so, as vers. 8-14 clearly show. That the historian, as has been before remarked, did not always give the full instructions Joshua received is evident from this passage. The priests are not said to have been instructed to sound the trumpet on the six days; yet we learn from Joshua 5:13 that they did so. It is rather implied than expressed that the ark was also to be borne in procession; but that this was (lone is evident from ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">Seven trumpets of rams' horns.</span> There is no mention of rams' horns in the original, which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> trumpets of jubilee, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of  triumph (hardly as Gesenius, "alarm trumpets," though not necessarily, with Dr. Vaughan in his 'Heroes of Faith,' "the emblems of festival, not of warfare").

Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;</span>), and according to Gesenius our word "yule" is also derived from this root. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> as the next verse shows, was a curved instrument, in shape like a ram's horn, though not necessarily of that material; whereas the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e6;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> was a straight trumpet. <span class="cmt_word">Seven times.</span> The importance of the number seven as indicative of completeness is here strongly indicated. Seven priests were to carry seven trumpets for seven days. The word for to swear, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> literally to be <span class="accented">sevened</span>, means to have one's vow consecrated and confirmed by seven sacrifices or seven witnesses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-28.htm">Genesis 21:28, 30</a>). The number seven, says Bahr in his 'Symbolik des Alten Testament,' 1, 187, 188, is the sign of the relation, union, communion between God and the world, as represented by the number three and four respectively, just as twelve is in another relation (see note on Joshua 21:3). Its meaning, according to Bahr, among the heathen is somewhat different. There it means the harmony of the universe, and is signified by the seven stars, to which, and neither more nor less, was the power of influencing man's destiny ascribed. <span class="cmt_word">And the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</span> "Fac tibi tribas ductiles, si sacerdos es, immo, quia sacerdos es (gens enim regalis effectus es et sacerdotium sanctum, de te enim scripture est), fac tibi tribas ductiles ex Scripturis sanctis" (Orig., Hom. 7 on Joshua). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Appearance and Message of the Angel of the Lord. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13-15</a>. When Joshua was by Jericho, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;, lit., in Jericho (&#1489;&#1468; expressing immediate proximity, the entrance as it were into some other object, vid., Ewald, 217), - that is to say, inside it in thought, meditating upon the conquest of it-he saw, on lifting up his eyes, a man standing before him with a drawn sword in his hand; and on going up to him, and asking, "Dost thou belong to us or to our enemies?" he received this reply: "Nay (&#1500;&#1488; is not to be altered into &#1500;&#1493;, which is the reading adopted in the Sept., Syr., and a few MSS), but I am the prince of the army of Jehovah; now I am come." The person who had appeared neither belonged to the Israelites nor to their enemies, but was the prince of the army of Jehovah, i.e., of the angels. "The Lord's host" does not mean "the people of Israel, who were just at the commencement of their warlike enterprise," as v. Hofmann supposes; for although the host of Israel who came out of Egypt are called "the hosts of the Lord" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>, the Israelites are never called the host or army of Jehovah (in the singular). "The host of Jehovah" is synonymous with "the host of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>), and signifies the angels, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>. With the words "now I am come," the prince of the angels is about to enter upon an explanation of the object of his coming; but he is interrupted in his address by Joshua, who falls down before him, and says, "What saith my lord to his servant?" so that now he first of all commands Joshua to take off his shoes, as the place on which he stands is holy. It by no means follows that because Joshua fell down upon the ground and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; (Eng. Ver. "did worship"), he must have recognised him at once as the angel of the Lord who was equal with God; for the word &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492;, which is connected with the falling down, does not always mean divine worship, but very frequently means nothing more than the deep Oriental reverence paid by a dependant to his superior or king (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-6.htm">2 Samuel 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-33.htm">2 Samuel 14:33</a>), and Joshua did not address the person who appeared to him by the name of God, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, but simply as &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, "My lord." In any case, however, Joshua regarded him at once as a superior being, i.e., an angel. And he must have recognised him as something more than a created angel of superior rank, that is to say, as the angel of Jehovah who is essentially equal with God, the visible revealer of the invisible God, as soon as he gave him the command to take off his shoes, etc. - a command which would remind him of the appearance of God to Moses in the burning bush, and which implied that the person who now appeared was the very person who had revealed himself to Moses as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. (On the meaning of the command to take off the shoes, see the exposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>.) The object of the divine appearance was indicated by the drawn sword in the hand (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-31.htm">Numbers 22:31</a>), by which he manifested himself as a heavenly warrior, or, as he describes himself to Joshua, as prince of the army of Jehovah. The drawn sword contained in itself this practical explanation: "I am now come with my heavenly army, to make war upon the Canaanites, and to assist thee and thy people" (Seb. Schmidt). It was not in a vision that this appearance took place, but it was an actual occurrence belonging to the external world; for Joshua saw the man with the drawn sword at a certain distance from himself, and went up to him to address him, - a fact which would be perfectly incompatible with an inward vision. </body></html>
