God's ministers, by the trumpet of the everlasting gospel, which proclaims liberty and victory, must encourage the followers of Christ in their spiritual warfare. As promised deliverances must be expected in God's way, so they must be expected in his time. At last the people were to shout: they did so, and the walls fell. This was a shout of faith; they believed the walls of Jericho would fall. It was a shout of prayer; they cry to Heaven for help, and help came.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the seventh day - Most probably a Sabbath day. The rising early would be necessary to give time for encompassing the city seven times. Jericho appears to have been a city of considerable size and population; and each passage of the large host round it could hardly have taken less than an hour and a half. Thus, with the necessary intervals of rest, the evening would be at hand when Joshua gave the signal to shout <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a>; and the work of slaughter was probably commenced just as the hours of the Sabbath were passed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. it came to pass at the seventh time, &#8230; Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city&#8212;This delay brought out their faith and obedience in so remarkable a manner, that it is celebrated by the apostle (Heb 11:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shout, </span> to testify your faith in God’s promise, and thankfulness for this glorious mercy, and to encourage yourselves and brethren, and to strike a terror into your enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass at the seventh time,....

"Before Jehovah," instead of "before the ark of Jehovah," as the signification of the ark was derived entirely from the fact, that it was the medium through which Jehovah communicated His gracious presence to the people. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-9.htm">Joshua 6:9</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; is in the perfect tense, and we must supply the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, which is sometimes omitted, not only in poetry, but also in prose, after a definite noun in the accusative (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-20.htm">Exodus 18:20</a>; see Ewald, 332, a.). There is not sufficient ground for altering the form of the word into &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1497;, according to the Keri, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506; is construed in other cases with the accusative &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;, instead of with &#1489;&#1468;, and that not only in poetry, but also in prose (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>, as compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18-20</a>). &#1493;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1506; &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1498;, "trumpeting continually" (Eng.
