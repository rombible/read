So He appoints, from whom, as creatures, they received their lives, and to whom, as sinners, they had forfeited them. Rahab perished not with them that believed not, Heb 11:31. All her kindred were saved with her; thus faith in Christ brings salvation to the house, Ac 14:31. She, and they with her, were plucked as brands from the burning. With Rahab, or with the men of Jericho; our portion must be assigned, as we posses or disregard the sign of salvation; even faith in Christ, which worketh by love. Let us remember what depends upon our choice, and let us choose accordingly. God shows the weight of a Divine curse; where it rests there is no getting from under it; for it brings ruin without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Accursed - Better as in margin, ("devoted" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a> note). In other cases the inhabitants only of the towns were slain; their cattle and property became the booty of the victors. But Jericho, as the first Canaanite city that was captured, was devoted by Israel as first-fruits to God, as a token that Israel received all the land from Him. Every living thing was put to death (Rahab and her household excepted) as a sacrifice to God, and the indestructible goods were <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a> brought into the treasury of the sanctuary. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 6:20, 21. The Walls Fall Down.<p>20, 21. So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets&#8212;Towards the close of the seventh circuit, the signal was given by Joshua, and on the Israelites' raising their loud war cry, the walls fell down, doubtless burying multitudes of the inhabitants in the ruins, while the besiegers, rushing in, consigned everything animate and inanimate to indiscriminate destruction (De 20:16, 17). Jewish writers mention it as an immemorial tradition that the city fell on the Sabbath. It should be remembered that the Canaanites were incorrigible idolaters, addicted to the most horrible vices, and that the righteous judgment of God might sweep them away by the sword, as well as by famine or pestilence. There was mercy mingled with judgment in employing the sword as the instrument of punishing the guilty Canaanites, for while it was directed against one place, time was afforded for others to repent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets,.... As Joshua had charged them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a>, <p>and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,  <p>and the people shouted with a great shout; that is, gave a loud shout, on hearing the long blast of the trumpets blown by the priests the seventh time, as they were no doubt directed by Joshua, agreeably to the order given to him; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>, <p>that the wall fell down flat; the wall of the city of Jericho, as the Lord said it should; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>, <p>so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city; they went up to it from the plain, where they were, and entered it without any difficulty, the wall being fallen, and that everywhere: so that they went directly from the place where they were, and went in right over against them, into every quarter and, part of the city, and seized on it, and possessed it at once. Various things may be observed concerning this surprising event; as that it was supernatural, and cannot be ascribed to second causes, there being nothing in the procession round the city, the blowing of the trumpets, or shout of the people, that could occasion the wall to fall; and that no defences or fortifications are anything against God, when it is his will a city should be taken, with whom nothing is impossible; and that sometimes unlikely means are appointed and used by him for doing great things, that the power may appear to be his by which they are done; and that faith stops at nothing, when it has the word and promise of God to encourage and support it; and that God does everything in his own time and way. The falling of the walls of Jericho may be considered as an emblem of the fall of Babylon; these two cities agree, as in their greatness, so in their wickedness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>; and as Jericho stood in the way of Israel's inheriting the land, being a frontier and barrier town; so mystical Babylon stands in the way of the kingdom of Christ, and its spread in the world, and particularly of the conversion of the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-14.htm">Revelation 11:14</a>. The fall of Jericho was very sudden, and when not expected by the inhabitants of it; and so will be the fall of Babylon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a>; and as Jericho fell at the sound of rams horns, the destruction of antichrist, or mystical Babylon, will be through the preaching of the Gospel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>; and as the one was by the sounding of seven priests, at the seventh time of sounding, on the seventh day; so the ruin of antichrist will be at the seventh angel's sounding the seventh trumpet, and pouring out the seventh vial, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-7.htm">Revelation 10:7</a>; and as at the destruction of the one, so of the other, but few saved from the common calamity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>; and both never to be raised up and built again, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>; And it may be considered also as an emblem of the subjection of the Gentile world to Christ; which, like Jericho, or the moon, as some observe the name signifies, is very changeable; and as that city, and the inhabitants of it, an enemy to God, and his people, and yet made subject by the ministry of his word; as particularly it will be when the kingdoms of this world shall become his: or rather it may be an emblem of the subjection of particular souls to Christ, and the means thereof; who are like the walled city of Jericho in their unregenerate state, their hearts hard, stubborn, and inflexible, and enmity to God; are self-confident, vainly puffed up in their fleshly minds, and shut up in unbelief, and kept and guarded by Satan, the strong man armed; but all these strong holds of sin and Satan are brought down and demolished in conversion; and that by means of the sound of the Gospel, which is as despicable with men as the sound of the rams' horns were to the inhabitants of Jericho; but is a jubilee and joyful sound, a sound of love, grace, mercy, and salvation; and being accompanied with the Spirit and grace of God, is the power of God unto salvation; and mighty through him for the removing the hardness of men's hearts, and bringing them into subjection and obedience to Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">the wall fell down flat</span>] No hand of man interposed to bring about this catastrophe, no merely natural causes precipitated the fall; “<span class="ital">by faith</span>,” as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews declares, “the walls of Jericho fell down” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-30.htm" title="By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.">Hebrews 11:30</a>). “When we examine the operation of faith in this instance, we shall see the point of the example to be in the refraining from action at the bidding of God. The impulse of nature was to attack the city; to try upon its bulwarks the skill of military science, as then understood, as by them possessed. The power of faith was shown in curbing that impulse; in submitting to an unexplained, unintelligible, severely trying, edict of inactivity; nay in consenting to play what must have seemed a ridiculous part, in the face of a warlike and disciplined host, waiting to see what this intrusive, this presumptuous horde of rovers had to say for itself.” To escort the Ark, “day after day for a whole week, round and round the ramparts of Jericho, crowded doubtless with armed spectators; to do this with a ceremonial which could be imposing only to themselves—which must have been not so much mysterious as ludicrous to the established ideas of the world, and even to those ‘thoughts of the heart’ which are busy in all of us, and which are the peculiar property neither of Jew nor Greek—must have taxed to the uttermost farthing the loyalty, the religion, and the moral courage of Israel; we can scarcely explain it otherwise than by saying that it was ‘by faith,’ in other words, that their apprehension of the invisible rose above the counteracting influences of the present, and enabled them to say within themselves, ‘We ought to obey God rather than man.’ ” Dr Vaughan’s <span class="ital">Heroes of Faith</span>, p. 257.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets, and it came to pass.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">and the people shouted, and they blew with the trumpets, and it came to pass as soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet.</span> The latter part of this sentence is a more full and accurate repetition of what is stated in the former.
