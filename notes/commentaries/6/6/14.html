God's ministers, by the trumpet of the everlasting gospel, which proclaims liberty and victory, must encourage the followers of Christ in their spiritual warfare. As promised deliverances must be expected in God's way, so they must be expected in his time. At last the people were to shout: they did so, and the walls fell. This was a shout of faith; they believed the walls of Jericho would fall. It was a shout of prayer; they cry to Heaven for help, and help came.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He said - The reading in the Hebrew text is "they said." Joshua no doubt issued his orders through the "officers of the people" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10</a>).<p>Him that is armed - i. e. the warriors generally, not a division only. "The rereward" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-9.htm">Joshua 6:9</a> was merely a detachment, and not a substantial portiere of the host; and was told off, perhaps, from the tribe of Dan (compare the marginal reference) to close the procession and guard the ark from behind. Thus the order would be<p>(1) the warriors,<p>(2) the seven priests blowing the cornets,<p>(3) the ark,<p>(4) the rear-guard. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-14.

In all other respects, down even to the smallest details, the arrangements of the first day continued to be the rule followed on the other six.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the second day they compassed the city once,....

"Before Jehovah," instead of "before the ark of Jehovah," as the signification of the ark was derived entirely from the fact, that it was the medium through which Jehovah communicated His gracious presence to the people. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-9.htm">Joshua 6:9</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; is in the perfect tense, and we must supply the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, which is sometimes omitted, not only in poetry, but also in prose, after a definite noun in the accusative (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-20.htm">Exodus 18:20</a>; see Ewald, 332, a.).
