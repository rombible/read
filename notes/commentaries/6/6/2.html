It shut itself up, being strongly fortified both by art and nature. Thus were they foolish, and their hearts hardened to their destruction; the miserable case of all that strengthen themselves against the Almighty. God resolves Israel shall be its master, and that quickly. No warlike preparations were to be made. By the uncommon method of besieging the city, the Lord honoured the ark, as the symbol of his presence, and showed that all the victories were from him. The faith and patience of the people were proved and increased.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This verse is strictly parenthetical.

The next day, i.e., on the 16th, or the day after the first feast-day, they ate unleavened loaves and parched corn ("roasted grains," see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>) of the produce of the land (&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <p>(Note: Rendered "old corn" in the Eng. version.)<p>which only occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-11.htm">Joshua 5:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>, is synonymous with &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;<p>(Note: Rendered fruit in our version.)<p>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>), i.e., corn that had grown in the land of Canaan, as the manna entirely ceased from this day forwards. "The morrow after the passover" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3</a> for the 15th Nisan; but here it must be understood as signifying the 16th, as the produce of the land, of which they ate not only on that day, but, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>, throughout that year, cannot mean the corn of the previous year, but the produce of this same year, i.e., the new corn, and they were not allowed to eat any of that till it had been sanctified to the Lord by the presentation of the wave sheaf on the second day of the passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-11.htm">Leviticus 23:11</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-11.htm">Leviticus 23:11</a>, the presentation was to take place on the day after the Sabbath, i.e., the first day of the feast of Mazzoth, which was kept as a Sabbath, or the 16th of Nisan, as the seven days' feast of Mazzoth commenced on the 15th (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-17.htm">Numbers 28:17</a>). "On the morrow after the passover" is the same as "on the morrow after the Sabbath" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-11.htm">Leviticus 23:11</a>, the term passover being used here not in its original and more restricted sense, in which it applies exclusively to the observance of the paschal meal, which took place on the evening of the 14th, and is expressly distinguished from the seven days' feast of Mazzoth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-27.htm">Exodus 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-16.htm">Numbers 28:16</a>), but in the broader sense, which we have already met with in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>, in which the name was gradually extended to the whole of the seven days' feast. The writer assumed that the facts themselves were already well known from the Mosaic law, and therefore did not think it necessary to give any fuller explanation. Moreover, the words, "they did eat of the fruit of the land," etc., are not to be understood as signifying that they began to eat unleavened bread for the first time on the 16th Nisan (they had already eaten is as an accompaniment to the paschal lamb); but unleavened bread of the produce of the land, the green corn of that year, was what they ate for the first time on that day. Especial prominence is given to this by the words, "in the self-same day," because not only did the eating of the new corn commence on that day, but from that day forward "the children of Israel had manna no more." This statement is evidently related to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>, and must be understood, according to that passage, as merely signifying, that on that day the gift of the manna entirely ceased (see Pentateuch, pp. 366ff.). </body></html>
