God's ministers, by the trumpet of the everlasting gospel, which proclaims liberty and victory, must encourage the followers of Christ in their spiritual warfare. As promised deliverances must be expected in God's way, so they must be expected in his time. At last the people were to shout: they did so, and the walls fell. This was a shout of faith; they believed the walls of Jericho would fall. It was a shout of prayer; they cry to Heaven for help, and help came.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He said - The reading in the Hebrew text is "they said." Joshua no doubt issued his orders through the "officers of the people" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10</a>).<p>Him that is armed - i. e. the warriors generally, not a division only. "The rereward" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-9.htm">Joshua 6:9</a> was merely a detachment, and not a substantial portiere of the host; and was told off, perhaps, from the tribe of Dan (compare the marginal reference) to close the procession and guard the ark from behind. Thus the order would be<p>(1) the warriors,<p>(2) the seven priests blowing the cornets,<p>(3) the ark,<p>(4) the rear-guard. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-14. Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord&#8212;The second day's procession seems to have taken place in the morning.

The plural &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; ("they said"), in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-7.htm">Joshua 6:7</a>, must not be altered, but is to be explained on the ground that Joshua did not make the proclamation to the people himself, but through the medium oft he shoterim, who were appointed to issue his commands (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10-11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-2.htm">Joshua 3:2-3</a>). In this proclamation the more minute instructions concerning the order of march, which had been omitted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3-5</a>, are given; namely, that &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; was to march in front of the ark. By &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, "the equipped (or armed) man," we are not to understand all the fighting men, as Knobel supposes; for in the description of the march which follows, the whole of the fighting men ("all the men of war," <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3</a>) are divided into &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; and &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507; (Eng. Ver. "the armed men" and "the rereward," <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-9.htm">Joshua 6:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-13.htm">Joshua 6:13</a>), so that the former can only have formed one division of the army. It is very natural therefore to suppose, as Kimchi and Rashi do, that the former were the fighting men of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh (&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>), and the latter the fighting men of the rest of the tribes. On the meaning of &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-25.htm">Numbers 10:25</a>. If we turn to the account of the facts themselves, we shall see at once, that in the report of the angel's message, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3-5</a>, several other points have been passed over for the purpose of avoiding too many repetitions, and have therefore to be gathered from the description of what actually occurred. First of all, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-8.htm">Joshua 6:8-10</a>, we have the appointment of the order of marching, namely, that the ark, with the priests in front carrying the trumpets of jubilee, was to form the centre of the procession, and that one portion of the fighting men was to go in front of it, and the rest to follow after; that the priests were to blow the trumpets every time they marched round during the seven days (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-8.htm">Joshua 6:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-9.htm">Joshua 6:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-13.htm">Joshua 6:13</a>); and lastly, that it was not till the seventh time of going round, on the seventh day, that the people were to raise the war-cry at the command of Joshua, and then the walls of the town were to fall (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-10.htm">Joshua 6:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a>). There can be no doubt that we are right in assuming that Joshua had received from the angel the command which he issued to the people in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>., that the whole town, with all its inhabitants and everything in it, was to be given up as a ban to the Lord, at the time when the first announcement concerning the fall of the town was made.</body></html>
