They brought on themselves the vengeance they justly merited, of which the Israelites were to be executioners, by the command the Lord gave to Moses.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render: "But the cities standing each on its own hill" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>). The meaning is simply that, with the exception of Hazor, Joshua did not burn the cities, but left them standing, each on its former site. This site is spoken of as a hill, because such was the ordinary site chosen for cities in Canaan (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. as for the cities that stood still in their strength&#8212;literally, "on their heaps."

Sidon is called the great (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>), because at that time it was the metropolis of Phoenicia; whereas even by the time of David it had lost its ancient splendour, and was outstripped by its daughter city Tyre. It is still to be seen in the town of Saida, a town of five or six thousand inhabitants, with many large and well-built houses (see Rob. Pal. iii. p. 415, and Movers, Phnizier, ii. 1, pp. 86ff.). Misrephothmaim (mentioned also at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>), which the Greek translators have taken as a proper name, though the Rabbins and some Christian commentators render it in different ways, such as salt-pits, smelting-huts, or glass-huts (see Ges. Thes. p. 1341), is a collection of springs, called Ain Mesherfi, at the foot of the promontory to which with its steep pass the name of Ras el Nakhra is given, the scala Tyriorum or Passepoulain of the Crusaders (see V. de Velde, Mem. p. 335, and Ritter, Erdk. xvi. p. 807). &#1502;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1514; (Eng.
