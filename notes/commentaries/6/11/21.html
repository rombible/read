The land rested from war. It ended not in a peace with the Canaanites, that was forbidden, but in a peace from them. There is a rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people of God, into which they shall enter, when their warfare is accomplished. That which was now done, is compared with what had been said to Moses. God's word and his works, if viewed together, will be found mutually to set each other forth. If we make conscience of our duty, we need not question the performance of the promise. But the believer must never put off his armour, or expect lasting peace, till he closes his eyes in death; nay, as his strength and usefulness increase, he may expect more heavy trials; yet the Lord will not permit any enemies to assault the believer till he has prepared him for the battle. Christ Jesus ever lives to plead for his people, and their faith shall not fail, however Satan may be permitted to assault them. And however tedious, sharp, and difficult the believer's warfare, his patience in tribulation may be encouraged by the joyfulness of hope; for he will, ere long, rest from sin and from sorrow in the Canaan above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At that time - i. e. in course of the "long time" mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-18.htm">Joshua 11:18</a>.<p>The Anakims - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>.

(Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)">Numbers 13:22</a> we are told of the spies that they “ascended by the south and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were,” and when this was reported to the Israelites, and they heard of “the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants, in whose sight the spies seemed as grasshoppers” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm" title="And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.">Numbers 13:33</a>), “all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried, and murmured against Moses and against Aaron” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/14-1.htm" title="And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night....">Numbers 14:1-2</a>). The sacred writer therefore now goes back to record pointedly this terrible race, who had inspired such faithless murmuring and complaint (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-2.htm" title="A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!">Deuteronomy 9:2</a>). It has been concluded by some that these giants were a tribe of Cushite wanderers from Babel, and of the same race as the Philistines, the Phœnicians, and the Egyptian shepherd-kings, representing one or more families of Amorite descent, distinguished for their lofty stature and physical powers. Thus Og, king of Bashan, is described as of the “remnant of the giants” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm" title="For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>). In Abraham’s time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/14-5.htm" title="And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,...">Genesis 14:5-6</a>) they inhabited the territories afterwards known as Edom and Moab, and the region east of Jordan, under the names of (<span class="ital">a</span>) Rephaims, (<span class="ital">b</span>) Zuzims or Zamzummims, (<span class="ital">c</span>) Emims, and (<span class="ital">d</span>) Horites. Here they were attacked by Chedorlaomer, the Elamite king, who also smote the Amorites of Engedi in the Jordan valley. Subsequently the Horites were conquered by the Edomites, the Emims and the Zuzims by the Moabites and Ammonites, while the remnant, to which Og king of Bashan belonged, was destroyed by the Israelites under Moses. Now, as under Moses on the east, so under Joshua on the west of Jordan, the Anakims were driven forth before the arms of Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from Hebron</span>] Which from the progenitor of this race received its original name of Kirjath-Arba.

Afterwards, when Ephraim and Manasseh entered on theirs, all Israel, except Judah, were camped in Shiloh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-1.htm" title="And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, to the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,">Joshua 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm" title="And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there.

What more natural than that the mountain given to ‘the children of Judah’ should have been called ‘the mountain of Judah,’ and that where all the rest of Israel camped ‘the mountain of Israel,’ and also ‘the mountain of Ephraim’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-50.htm" title="According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelled therein.">Joshua 19:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm" title="And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.">Joshua 20:7</a>), because it was afterwards given to that tribe?” Dr Edersheim’s <span class="ital">Israel in Canaan</span>, p. 86.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at that time</span> (see ver. 18). What is meant is, during the continuance of the war in which the country above described was conquered.

Gesenius would derive the German <span class="accented">nacken</span> and the English <span class="accented">neck</span> from this root. The word is used of the chains on the necks of camels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>. So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a>, of a necklace). They were men of gigantic stature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32</a>), and were no doubt a hill tribe of the Amorites. It is worthy of remark that to the two fearless men whose faith did not fail them at the sight of the walled cities, and of the giant forms of their inhabitants, was entrusted the task of overcoming these antagonists, and thus of proving the truth of their own words. Thus it ever is in the counsels of God. "To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away." To Joshua, who had confidence in God, the whole land of Canaan was given into subjection. From the Israelites, who had not that confidence, the inheritance of their fathers was taken away (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21, 28</a>). Many writers suppose that these Anakim (like the Rephaim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>) were the aboriginal inhabitants, and of Turanian descent (see note on next verse). <span class="cmt_word">Anab</span>.

At the same time, the expression certainly implies that the towns were generally built upon hills. The pointing in &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is not to be altered, as Knobel suggests. The singular "upon their hill" is to be taken as distributive: standing, now as then, each upon its hill. - With <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-15.htm">Joshua 11:15</a>, "as Jehovah commanded His servant Moses" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16</a>), the account of the wars of Joshua is brought to a close, and the way opened for proceeding to the concluding remarks with reference to the conquest of the whole land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16-23</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;, he put not away a word, i.e., left nothing undone. </body></html>
