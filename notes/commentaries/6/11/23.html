The land rested from war. It ended not in a peace with the Canaanites, that was forbidden, but in a peace from them. There is a rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people of God, into which they shall enter, when their warfare is accomplished. That which was now done, is compared with what had been said to Moses. God's word and his works, if viewed together, will be found mutually to set each other forth. If we make conscience of our duty, we need not question the performance of the promise. But the believer must never put off his armour, or expect lasting peace, till he closes his eyes in death; nay, as his strength and usefulness increase, he may expect more heavy trials; yet the Lord will not permit any enemies to assault the believer till he has prepared him for the battle. Christ Jesus ever lives to plead for his people, and their faith shall not fail, however Satan may be permitted to assault them. And however tedious, sharp, and difficult the believer's warfare, his patience in tribulation may be encouraged by the joyfulness of hope; for he will, ere long, rest from sin and from sorrow in the Canaan above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These words import that Joshua had overcome all overt resistance.

It rather implies that the Israelites no longer needed to war <span class="ital">unitedly</span> against the Canaanites. There was yet much land to be possessed, but the time had arrived for the occupation of the country by the different tribes, and the completion of the work of conquest was now to be left to the separate action of each.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joshua took the whole land.</span> The word must not be pressed to mean that every Canaanitish stronghold was razed or appropriated. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, as has been before remarked, has a very loose signification in Hebrew. What is meant is simply this. Joshua had established an unquestioned military preponderance in Palestine. He had broken down all resistance; but before he completed his conquests to their full extent, he had to provide for the peaceable settlement of the tribes in the territory he had seized. The complete extermination of the Canaanites formed no part of his commission or his plan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-29.htm">Exodus 23:29, 30</a>). To have effected it would have been to throw the land out of cultivation, and to expose its possessors to the usual inconveniences of depopulated districts. Therefore it was Joshua's policy to leave the Canaanites to be extirpated by degrees, and to encourage the Israelites to cultivate the arts both of war and of peace; to nourish a martial spirit by remembering that numerous and active enemies still dwelt in their midst, while yet they were not neglectful of the importance of a settled and civilised, an agricultural and pastoral life. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1, 2</a>. This purpose was defeated, not only by the usual effects of civilisation upon hardy or savage tribes, but also by the Israelites becoming addicted to the pleasant but enfeebling vices of the races they had supplanted. We see in the Israelitish history the best exemplification of St. Paul's theory that the "law worketh wrath," although it is "holy, just, and good." The excellence of the moral precepts delivered by Moses did but serve to manifest more clearly the inherent depravity of our nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7, 8</a>), and its need of a Saviour, who should render obedience possible by the gift of regeneration, and the infusion of His own Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">According to their divisions.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">their divisions by lot</span>, the word being derived from the same root as the word Halak in ver. 7, because a smooth stone was usually employed in casting lots. Hence it came to mean any authoritative division or distribution, as the courses of the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6</a>), the classification for purposes of enlistment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1</a>) and the like. <span class="cmt_word">And the land rested from war.</span> That is to say, the Canaanites were so thoroughly cowed and dispirited that they dared offer no further resistance to the Israelites in their task of portioning out the land. They were quite contented to be allowed to live in peace in such of their cities which remained, and had no disposition to court an overthrow such as took place at the battles of Gibeon and Merom, with its inevitable results of the absolute extermination, not only of every one who took up arms, but of every human being in the city to which they belonged. Thus the Israelites were able to give their whole attention to the survey and apportionment of the territory according to the relative size and importance of the tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Retrospective View of the Conquest of the Whole Land. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>. Joshua took all this land, namely, those portions of Southern Canaan that have already been mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40-41</a>; also the Arabah, and the mountains of Israel and its lowlands (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>), i.e., the northern part of the land (in the campaign described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1-15</a>), that is to say, Canaan in all its extent, "from the bald mountain which goeth up to Seir" in the south, "to Baal-gad, in the valley of Lebanon under Hermon." The "bald mountain" (Halak), which is mentioned here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a> as the southern boundary of Canaan, is hardly the row of white cliffs which stretches obliquely across the Arabah eight miles below the Dead Sea and forms the dividing line that separates this valley into el-Ghor and el-Araba (Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 489, 492), or the present Madara, a strange-looking chalk-hill to the south-west of the pass of Sufah (Rob. ii. p. 589), a steep bare mountain in a barren plain, the sides of which consist of stone and earth of a leaden ashy hue (Seetzen, R. iii. pp. 14, 15); but in all probability the northern edge of the Azazimeh mountain with its white and glistening masses of chalk. Baal-gad, i.e., the place or town of Baal, who was there worshipped as Gad (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-11.htm">Isaiah 65:11</a>), also called Baal-hermon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a>, is not Baalbek, but the Paneas or Caesarea Philippi of a later time, the present Banjas (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8-9</a>). This is the opinion of v. Raumer and Robinson, though Van de Velde is more disposed to look for Baal-gad in the ruins of Kalath (the castle of) Bostra, or of Kalath Aisafa, the former an hour and a half, the latter three hours to the north of Banjas, the situation of which would accord with the biblical statements respecting Baal-gad exceedingly well. The "valley of Lebanon" is not Coele-Syria, the modern Beka, between Lebanon and Antilibanus, but the valley at the foot of the southern slope of Jebel Sheik (Hermon). </body></html>
