The land rested from war. It ended not in a peace with the Canaanites, that was forbidden, but in a peace from them. There is a rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people of God, into which they shall enter, when their warfare is accomplished. That which was now done, is compared with what had been said to Moses. God's word and his works, if viewed together, will be found mutually to set each other forth. If we make conscience of our duty, we need not question the performance of the promise. But the believer must never put off his armour, or expect lasting peace, till he closes his eyes in death; nay, as his strength and usefulness increase, he may expect more heavy trials; yet the Lord will not permit any enemies to assault the believer till he has prepared him for the battle. Christ Jesus ever lives to plead for his people, and their faith shall not fail, however Satan may be permitted to assault them. And however tedious, sharp, and difficult the believer's warfare, his patience in tribulation may be encouraged by the joyfulness of hope; for he will, ere long, rest from sin and from sorrow in the Canaan above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A long time - At least five years; according to others, seven years (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10</a>, and Introduction).

Though, according to the Jews, Joshua, upon his first landing in Canaan, sent letters and messages to all the inhabitants of the land, offering them peace on certain terms; particularly that he sent three messages, or proposed three things to them; that those who had a mind to flee might flee; that those who were desirous of making peace might make it; and they that were for war, let them fight; all were for the last, and so perished (e): <p>save the Hivites and the inhabitants of Gibeon; these, some have thought, did not hear of the offers of peace, others think they did, and at first rejected them, but repenting were obliged to take the crafty methods they did to obtain it, of which see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1</a>, <p>all other they took in battle; refusing to submit to them and make peace with them. <p>(e) Hieros.

At the same time, the expression certainly implies that the towns were generally built upon hills. The pointing in &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is not to be altered, as Knobel suggests. The singular "upon their hill" is to be taken as distributive: standing, now as then, each upon its hill. - With <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-15.htm">Joshua 11:15</a>, "as Jehovah commanded His servant Moses" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16</a>), the account of the wars of Joshua is brought to a close, and the way opened for proceeding to the concluding remarks with reference to the conquest of the whole land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16-23</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;, he put not away a word, i.e., left nothing undone. </body></html>
