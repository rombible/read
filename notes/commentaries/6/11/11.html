They brought on themselves the vengeance they justly merited, of which the Israelites were to be executioners, by the command the Lord gave to Moses.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One portion of the defeated host fled north-westward toward Zidon; the other northeastward up the Ard el Huleh.<p>Zidon, as the metropolis of various subject towns and territories, appears <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a> to have been afterward assigned to Asher, but was not, in fact, conquered by that tribe <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>. It is mentioned in Egyptian papyri of great antiquity, and by Homer, and was in the most ancient times the capital of Phoenicia. In later times it was eclipsed by Tyre (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>). The prophets frequently couple Tyre and Sidon together, as does also the New Testament (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-2.htm">Isaiah 23:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-22.htm">Matthew 11:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>, etc.).<p>Both the site and signification of Misre-photh-maim are uncertain. Some have thought it identical with "Zarephath which belongeth to Zidon" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>, the Sarepta of the New Test. The name is explained by some (see the margin) as meaning hot springs; by others as salt pits; i. e. pits where the sea water was evaporated for the sake of its salt; and again by others as "smelting factories near the waters." Some, tracing the word to quite another root, render it "heights of waters," or copious springs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. he burnt Hazor with fire&#8212;calmly and deliberately, doubtless, according to divine direction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There was not any, </span> i.e. no human person. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them,....

He resolved to prevent this in the case of Hazor, which had been the capital of the neighbourhood, though he did not think the same step necessary in the case of the inferior cities. Hazor was afterwards rebuilt and reoccupied by the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>), though not in the time of Joshua. For the present, this destruction of the stronghold of Phoenician power in the north was a decisive measure, and would have been so permanently had the Israelites followed up the policy of Joshua. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These came out with their armies, a people as numerous as the sand by the sea-shore (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>, etc.), and very many horses and chariots. All these kings agreed together, sc., concerning the war and the place of battle, and encamped at Merom to fight against Israel. The name Merom (Meirm in the Arabic version) answers to Meirm, a village whose name is also pronounced Meirm, a celebrated place of pilgrimage among the Jews, because Hillel, Shammai, Simeon ben Jochai, and other noted Rabbins are said to be buried there (see Robinson, Pal. iii. p. 333), about two hours' journey north-west of Szafed, upon a rocky mountain, at the foot of which there is a spring that forms a small brook and flows away through the valley below Szafed (Seetzen, R. ii. pp. 127-8; Robinson, Bibl. Res. pp. 73ff.). This stream, which is said to reach the Lake of Tiberias, in the neighbourhood of Bethsaida, is in all probability to be regarded as the "waters of Merom," as, according to Josephus (Ant. v. 1, 18), "these kings encamped at Berothe (de. Bell. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/20.htm">Jude 20</a>.6, and Vit. 37, 'Meroth'), a city of Upper Galilee, not far from Kedese."<p>(Note: The traditional opinion that "waters of Merom" is the Old Testament name for the Lake of Samochonitis, or Huleh, is not founded upon any historical evidence, but is simply an inference of Hadr. Reland (Pal. Ill. p. 262), (1) from the statement made by Josephus (Ant. v. 5, 1), that Hazor was above the Lake of Somochonitis, it being taken for granted without further reason that the battle occurred at Hazor, and (2) from the supposed similarity in the meaning of the names, viz., that Samochonitis is derived from an Arabic word signifying to be high, and therefore means the same as Merom (height), though here again the zere is disregarded, and Merom is arbitrarily identified with Marom.)</body></html>
