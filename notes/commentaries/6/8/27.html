None of their conduct can be drawn into an example for others. Especial reason no doubt there was for this severity to the king of Ai; it is likely he had been notoriously wicked and vile, and a blasphemer of the God of Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No doubt Joshua had ascended the heights, most likely those to the north of the valley, so as to separate himself from the flying Israelites on the lower ground, and to be visible to the men in ambush behind the city.

Joshua drew not his hand back&#8212;Perhaps, from the long continuance of the posture, it might have been a means appointed by God, to animate the people, and kept up in the same devout spirit as Moses had shown, in lifting up his hands, until the work of slaughter had been completed&#8212;the ban executed.

On looking back to their town the Aites saw the smoke of the town ascending towards heaven: "and there were not hands in them to flee hither and thither," i.e., they were utterly unable to flee. "Hand," as the organs of enterprise and labour, in the sense of "strength," not "room," for which we should expect to find &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;. There is an analogous passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>, "None of the men of might have found their hands." For the people that fled to the wilderness (the Israelitish army) turned against the pursuers (the warriors of Ai), or, as is added by way of explanation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-21.htm">Joshua 8:21</a>, when Joshua and all Israel saw the town in the hands of the ambuscade, and the smoke ascending, they turned round and smote the people of Ai; and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-22.htm">Joshua 8:22</a>) these (i.e., the Israelites who had formed the ambuscade) came out of the town to meet them. "These" (Eng. the other), as contrasted with "the people that fled" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-20.htm">Joshua 8:20</a>, refers back to "the ambush" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-19.htm">Joshua 8:19</a>. In this way the Aites were in the midst of the people of Israel, who came from this side and that side, and smote them to the last man. "So that they let none of them remain:" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-35.htm">Numbers 21:35</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:3</a>, except that in this case it is strengthened still further by &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;, "or escape."</body></html>
