None of their conduct can be drawn into an example for others. Especial reason no doubt there was for this severity to the king of Ai; it is likely he had been notoriously wicked and vile, and a blasphemer of the God of Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No doubt Joshua had ascended the heights, most likely those to the north of the valley, so as to separate himself from the flying Israelites on the lower ground, and to be visible to the men in ambush behind the city.

The word in ver. 19 (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;</span>) has rather the sense of kindling a fire; the word here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5ea;</span>), more the sense of destruction by fire. <span class="cmt_word">A heap forever.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> a heap of eternity; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a heap forever, at least up to the time of our writer. But the Ai mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a> may have been a city built, not on precisely the same spot, but near enough to it to take its name. And if Ai signifies ruins, and Dean Stanley be right in regarding it as referring to ruins in the days of the Philistines, the name would be particularly suitable to this particular city. Travellers have identified the place with Tel-el. Hajar, immediately to the south of the Wady Mutyah. But see note on ch. 7:2 for Robinson's conclusion, which is confirmed by Canon Tristram, from the belief that Tel-el-Hajar does not answer to the description of Ai in the Scripture narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Hanged on a tree.</span> Literally, "on the tree." Perhaps after his death, But see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-22.htm">Genesis 40:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Until eventide.</span> We find here a remarkable coincidence with the precept in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>.

THE COPY OF THE LAW. - <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The men of Ai then turned round behind them, being evidently led to do so by the Israelites, who may have continued looking round to the town of Ai when the signal had been given by Joshua, to see whether the men in ambush had taken it and set it on fire, and as soon as they saw that this had been done began to offer still further resistance to their pursuers, and to defend themselves vigorously against them. On looking back to their town the Aites saw the smoke of the town ascending towards heaven: "and there were not hands in them to flee hither and thither," i.e., they were utterly unable to flee. "Hand," as the organs of enterprise and labour, in the sense of "strength," not "room," for which we should expect to find &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;. There is an analogous passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>, "None of the men of might have found their hands." For the people that fled to the wilderness (the Israelitish army) turned against the pursuers (the warriors of Ai), or, as is added by way of explanation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-21.htm">Joshua 8:21</a>, when Joshua and all Israel saw the town in the hands of the ambuscade, and the smoke ascending, they turned round and smote the people of Ai; and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-22.htm">Joshua 8:22</a>) these (i.e., the Israelites who had formed the ambuscade) came out of the town to meet them. "These" (Eng. the other), as contrasted with "the people that fled" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-20.htm">Joshua 8:20</a>, refers back to "the ambush" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-19.htm">Joshua 8:19</a>. In this way the Aites were in the midst of the people of Israel, who came from this side and that side, and smote them to the last man. "So that they let none of them remain:" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-35.htm">Numbers 21:35</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:3</a>, except that in this case it is strengthened still further by &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;, "or escape."</body></html>
