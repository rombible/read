Those that would maintain their spiritual conflicts must not love their ease. Probably he went into the valley alone, to pray to God for a blessing, and he did not seek in vain. He never drew back till the work was done. Those that have stretched out their hands against their spiritual enemies, must never draw them back.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No doubt Joshua had ascended the heights, most likely those to the north of the valley, so as to separate himself from the flying Israelites on the lower ground, and to be visible to the men in ambush behind the city. He now, at the command of God, gives the appointed signal to the ambush. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-25. Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city&#8212;The uplifted spear had probably a flag, or streamer on it, to render it the more conspicuous from the height where he stood. At the sight of this understood signal the ambush nearest the city, informed by their scouts, made a sudden rush and took possession of the city, telegraphing to their brethren by raising a smoke from the walls. Upon seeing this, the main body, who had been reigning a flight, turned round at the head of the pass upon their pursuers, while the twenty-five thousand issuing from their ambuscade, fell back upon their rear. The Ai-ites surprised, looked back, and found their situation now desperate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The other; </span> they who lay in ambush.

That is, the ambush, or at least a part of them: <p>so that they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; or, as we commonly say, they were between two fires, the ambush on one side, the army of Israel on the other: <p>and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape; not one was saved alive, excepting their king, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-23.htm">Joshua 8:23</a>; no quarter was given them, nor any suffered to make their escape. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</span><p>(i) Who came out of the ambush.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">so they were in the midst of Israel</span>] “The host of Israel now turned again, while those who had set Ai on fire advanced in an opposite direction.

It is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-17.htm">Joshua 8:17</a> that the inhabitants of Bethel, which was about three hours' journey from Ai, took part in the battle, probably in consequence of a treaty which the king of Ai had made with them in the expectation of a renewed and still stronger attack on the part of the Israelites. Nothing further is known upon this point; nor can anything be inferred from the fact that the king of Bethel is included in the list of the kings slain by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-16.htm">Joshua 12:16</a>). Consequently, we cannot decide whether the Bethelites came to the help of the Aites for the first time on the day of the battle itself, or, what is more probable, had already sent men to Ai, to help to repulse the expected attack of the Israelites upon that town.</body></html>
