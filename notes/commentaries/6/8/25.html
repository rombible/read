None of their conduct can be drawn into an example for others. Especial reason no doubt there was for this severity to the king of Ai; it is likely he had been notoriously wicked and vile, and a blasphemer of the God of Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No doubt Joshua had ascended the heights, most likely those to the north of the valley, so as to separate himself from the flying Israelites on the lower ground, and to be visible to the men in ambush behind the city. He now, at the command of God, gives the appointed signal to the ambush. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword&#8212;the women, children, and old persons left behind, amounting, in all, to twelve thousand people [Jos 8:25].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not strictly, but largely so called, who were now in Ai, either as constant and settled inhabitants, or as sojourners, and such as came to them for their help, such as being confederate with them are esteemed as one with them; for it is evident that <span class="ital">the men of Beth-el</span> are included in this number, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-17.htm" title="And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.">Joshua 8:17</a></span>, the Israelites who took this number being unable to distinguish who belonged to the one city, and who to the other. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And so it was, that all that fell that day,....

The object &#1497;&#1491;, which is missing (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-19.htm">Joshua 8:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a>), may easily be supplied from the apposition &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. The raising of the javelin would probably be visible at a considerable distance, even if it was not provided with a small flag, as both earlier and later commentators assume, since Joshua would hardly be in the mist of the flying Israelites, but would take his station as commander upon some eminence on one side. And the men in ambush would have scouts posted to watch for the signal, which had certainly been arranged beforehand, and convey the information to the others.</body></html>
