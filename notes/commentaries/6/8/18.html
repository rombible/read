In the former case the hand of Jehovah alone does the work. The ark is borne round the walls until they fall down before it. Against Ai, the hand of Israel is employed, and first of all in Israel the hand of Joshua. He seems to have stretched it out, with the light spear or javelin which he carried, somewhat as Moses stretched forth the rod of God over the contending hosts of Amalek and Israel, until the enemy was discomfited with the edge of the sword.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-18.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand.

Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city&#8212;The uplifted spear had probably a flag, or streamer on it, to render it the more conspicuous from the height where he stood. At the sight of this understood signal the ambush nearest the city, informed by their scouts, made a sudden rush and took possession of the city, telegraphing to their brethren by raising a smoke from the walls. Upon seeing this, the main body, who had been reigning a flight, turned round at the head of the pass upon their pursuers, while the twenty-five thousand issuing from their ambuscade, fell back upon their rear. The Ai-ites surprised, looked back, and found their situation now desperate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The spear, </span> or, <span class="ital">thy banner</span>; or there might be some banner in the end of his spear.

This was probably a side valley branching off towards the south from the eastern continuation of the Wady es Suweinit. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a>, the account of the preparations for the attack is founded off by a repetition of the notice as to the forces engaged, and in some respects a more exact description of their disposition. Joshua, it is stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>, took about 5000 men and placed them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the town. As the place where this ambuscade was posted is described in precisely the same terms as that which was occupied, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-9.htm">Joshua 8:9</a>, by the 30,000 men who were sent out to form an ambuscade in the night before the advance of the main army against Ai (for the substitution of "the city" for Ai cannot possibly indicate a difference in the locality), the view held by the majority of commentators, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a> refers to a second ambuscade, which Joshua sent out in addition to the 30,000, and posted by the side of them, is even more than questionable, and is by no means raised into a probability by the expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1493; (Eng. "their liers in wait") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a>. The description of the place, "on the west of the city," leaves no doubt whatever that "their liers in wait" are simply the ambuscade (&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;) mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>, which was sent out from the whole army, i.e., the ambuscade that was posted on the west of the town. &#1506;&#1511;&#1489; signifies literally the lier in wait (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a>), from &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, insidiari, and is synonymous with &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;. The meaning which Gesenius and others attach to the word, viz., the rear or hinder part of the army, cannot be sustained from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>. If we add to this the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a> is obviously nothing more than a repetition of the description already given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-11.htm">Joshua 8:11</a> of the place where the main army was posted, and therefore bears the character of a closing remark introduced to wind up the previous account, we cannot regard <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a> as anything more than a repetition of the statements in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-9.htm">Joshua 8:9</a>, and can only explain the discrepancy with regard to the number of men who were placed in ambush, by supposing that, through a copyist's error, the number which was expressed at first in simple letters has in one instance been given wrongly. The mistake, however, is not to be found in the 5000 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>), but in the 30,000 in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>, where &#1492; has been confounded with &#1500;. For a detachment of 5000 men would be quite sufficient for an ambuscade that had only to enter the town after the soldiers had left it in pursuit of the Israelites, and to set it on fire, whereas it hardly seems possible that 30,000 men should have been posted in ambush so near to the town.<p>(Note: We need have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that there is a mistake in the number given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>, as the occurrence of such mistakes in the historical books is fully established by a comparison of the numbers given in the books of Samuel and Kings with those in the books of Chronicles, and is admitted by every commentator. In my earlier commentary on Joshua, I attempted to solve the difficulty by the twofold assumption: first, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a> contains a supplementary statement, in which the number of the men posted in ambush is given for the firs time; and secondly, that the historian forgot to notice that out of the 30,000 men whom Joshua chose to make war upon Ai, 5000 were set apart to lie in ambush. But, on further examination of the text, I have come to the conclusion that the second assumption is irreconcilable with the distinct words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>, and feel obliged to give it up. On the other hand, I still adhere to the conviction that there is not sufficient ground either for the assumption that <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a>, contain an old marginal gloss that has crept into the text, or for the hypothesis of Ewald and Knobel, that these verses were introduced by the last editor of the book out of some other document. The last hypothesis amounts to a charge of thoughtlessness against the latest editor, which is hardly reconcilable with the endeavour, for which he is praised in other places, to reconcile the discrepancies in the different documents.)<p> - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a>, &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; (the people) is to be taken as the subject of the sentence: "The people had set all the host, that was on the north of the city, and its ambuscade on the west of the city." In the night, namely the night before the army arrived at the north of the town, Joshua went through the midst of the valley, which separated the Israelites from the town, so that in the morning he stood with all the army close before the town.</body></html>
