It is a note of time. Josephus places this transaction later. The LXX. places <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be you dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:">Joshua 8:1-2</a> of Joshua 9 before this passage. But there seems no reason for moving the transaction from the place where we find it in the text. By the capture of Ai, Joshua had obtained command over the road to Shechem. We hear of no strong place north of Beth-el in that part of the country. From other passages (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-18.htm" title="But the mountain shall be yours; for it is a wood, and you shall cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be yours: for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.">Joshua 17:18</a>) there seems reason to think that a large part of this district was wooded and uncleared. The confederacy of the southern kings had its centre far to the south of this, and there was a considerable distance between Shechem and the strong places to the north. It is in keeping with what we have already observed regarding the purpose of the conquest of Canaan, that the law of the God of Israel should be as soon as possible proclaimed and set up in the heart of the country, to be thenceforward the law of the land. For the enactment that was here carried out, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/11-26.htm" title="Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;">Deuteronomy 11:26-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-2.htm" title="And it shall be on the day when you shall pass over Jordan to the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set you up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:">Deuteronomy 27:2</a>, &c. Observe also that the command there given required the work to be done as soon after the passing of Jordan as possible. The possibility of reading the law from this position, so as to be heard by the whole congregation, has been proved by actual experiment.<p>(30, 31) <span class= "bld">An altar . . . in mount Ebal . . .</span>—This was explicitly commanded in Deuteronomy. The blessing was put on mount Gerizim, the altar and the curse on mount Ebal. We do not hear elsewhere of any sacrifice on Ebal. But it is certain that God accepted sacrifices in many places in Canaan. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-24.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Away, get you down, and you shall come up, you, and Aaron with you: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth on them.">Exodus 19:24</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm" title="Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,">Joshua 8:30</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Joshua built an altar — </span>Namely, after the taking of Ai.

We must not think to defer covenanting with God till we are settled in the world; nor must any business put us from minding and pursuing the one thing needful. The way to prosper is to begin with God, Mt 6:33. They built an altar, and offered sacrifice to God, in token of their dedicating themselves to God, as living sacrifices to his honour, in and by a Mediator. By Christ's sacrifice of himself for us, we have peace with God. It is a great mercy to any people to have the law of God in writing, and it is fit that the written law should be in a known tongue, that it may be seen and read of all men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The account of this solemnity is very brief. An acquaintance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a> is evidently presupposed; and the three several acts of which the solemnity consisted are only so far distinctly named as is necessary to show that the commands of Moses there given were fully carried out by Joshua.<p>It is difficult to escape the conviction that these verses are here out of their proper and original place. The connection between <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1</a>, is natural and obvious; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a>, the fraud of the Gibeonites is represented as growing out of the alarm caused by the fall of Jericho and Ai. It is, moreover, extremely unlikely that a solemnity of this nature in the very center of the country should be undertaken by Joshua while the whole surrounding district was in the hands of the enemy; or that, if undertaken, it would have been carried out unmolested. "And the strangers that were conversant among them" <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-35.htm">Joshua 8:35</a>, were present at it. The distance fromm Gilgal in the Jordan valley to Mount Ebal is fully 30 miles, unless - as is unlikely - another Gilgal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a> note) be meant; and so vast a host, with its non-effective followers <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-35.htm">Joshua 8:35</a>, could certainly not have accomplished a march like this through a difficult country and a hostile population in less than three days. Moreover in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-15.htm">Joshua 10:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-43.htm">Joshua 10:43</a>, the Israelites are spoken of as still encamping at Gilgal.<p>It is on the whole likely that, for these and other reasons, this passage does not, in our present Bible, stand in its proper context; and it has been conjectured that the place from which these six verses have been transferred is the end of <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11.htm">Joshua 11</a>:The "then" with which <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a> opens in our present text may well have served to introduce the account of the solemnity on Gerizim and Ebal at the end of the record of Joshua's victories, to which indeed it forms a suitable climax.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 8:30, 31. Joshua Builds an Altar.<p>30, 31. Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in mount Ebal&#8212;(See on [184]De 27:11). This spot was little short of twenty miles from Ai. The march through a hostile country and the unmolested performance of the religious ceremonial observed at this mountain, would be greatly facilitated, through the blessing of God, by the disastrous fall of Ai. The solemn duty was to be attended to at the first convenient opportunity after the entrance into Canaan (De 27:2); and with this in view Joshua seems to have conducted the people through the mountainous region that intervened though no details of the journey have been recorded. Ebal was on the north, opposite to Gerizim, which was on the south side of the town Sichem (Nablous).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then, </span> to wit, after the taking of Ai.

As was commanded, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5</a>. The Samaritan Chronicle says, it was built in Mount Gerizim; but there is a difficulty arises, when this was done by Joshua; it should seem by inserting the account here, that it was done immediately after the destruction of Ai; and Mercator endeavours to prove that Ebal was near to Ai, but what he has said does not give satisfaction; for certain it is, that Ebal and Gerizim were near Shechem in Samaria, at a great distance from Ai, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6</a>. The Jews (a) generally are of opinion, that this was done as soon as Israel, even the very day, they passed over Jordan, which they think the letter of the command required, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a>; though it does not, only that it should be done after they were passed over it; Ebal being at too great a distance from Jordan for them to accomplish it on that day, being, as they themselves say (b), sixty miles from Jordan; so that they are obliged to make Israel travel that day an hundred twenty miles, and as they assert they did (c) and which they must do, if what they say was true, it being sixty miles to Ebal, and sixty more to return again to Gilgal that night, where they encamped, but this is incredible: and as this account of Joshua's building the altar is too soon after he had passed Jordan, what R. Ishmael (d) has pitched upon is too late, who says this was not done till after fourteen years, when the land was conquered, which was seven years doing, and when it was divided, which were seven years more; what Josephus says (e) is more probable than either, which is, that Joshua, five years after he had entered Canaan, when he had placed the tabernacle at Shiloh, went from thence and built an altar at Ebal; as for what R. Eliezer suggests (f), that Ebal and Gerizim here mentioned are not the Ebal and Gerizim of the Samaritans, only two hills were made, and they were called by these names, cannot merit any belief or regard. <p>(a) Misn.

The Altar of Blessing and of Cursing<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">Then Joshua built</span>] The passes being now secured, and the interior of the country rendered accessible, Joshua resolved to take advantage of the terror which the success of his arms had inspired in the hearts of the Canaanites, and to carry out the command of Moses respecting the ratification of the Law with solemn ceremonies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/27-2.htm" title="And it shall be on the day when you shall pass over Jordan to the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set you up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:...">Deuteronomy 27:2-8</a>). By a grand national act it was to be declared “in what character Israel meant to hold what it had received of God.” This act was to consist of three parts:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>)&emsp;&emsp;The Law was to be inscribed on “great stones” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-2.htm" title="And it shall be on the day when you shall pass over Jordan to the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set you up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:">Deuteronomy 27:2</a>) which had been “plaistered with plaister;” and these as Memorial Stones were to be set up on “mount Ebal” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-4.htm" title="Therefore it shall be when you be gone over Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.">Deuteronomy 27:4</a>);<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>)&emsp;&emsp;An altar of “whole stones” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/27-5.htm" title="And there shall you build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones: you shall not lift up any iron tool on them....">Deuteronomy 27:5-6</a>) was to be erected on the same spot and solemn sacrifices offered thereon;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>)&emsp;&emsp;The priests with the Ark were to occupy the valley between Ebal and Gerizim, surrounded by the elders, officers, and judges; the curses of the Law were then to be read aloud by the Levites, to which half the tribes on Ebal were to respond with a loud <span class="ital">Amen</span>, and to the blessings of the Law the other half on Gerizim were similarly to testify their acquiescence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in mount Ebal</span>] To carry out this solemn function, the first step taken by Joshua was to advance with the people from Ai and Beth-el northwards towards Shechem, to the valley bounded on the south by the range of Gerizim, and on the north by that of Ebal, “the most beautiful, perhaps it might be said the only very beautiful spot in central Palestine.” Two events consecrated the valley in the memory of every Israelite. (<span class="ital">a</span>) It was here that Abraham halted on his journey from Chaldæa and erected his first altar to the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land....">Genesis 12:6-7</a>); (<span class="ital">b</span>) It was here that Jacob settled on his return from the same region of Mesopotamia, and bought the parcel of the field, where he had spread his tent, of the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of money (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal.</span> This passage has been pronounced to be an interpolation by Meyer, De Wette, Maurer, Rosenmuller, Knobel, and others. The LXX. does not introduce it here, but after <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-2.htm">Joshua 9:2</a>. For other authorities see below. It is very easy to see why its genuineness has been disputed. The Book of Joshua has many marks of having been written not so very long after the events described in it. But it has been a favourite opinion with the school which disputes the authenticity of the books of the Bible, that Deuteronomy was a late revision by Ezra of the law of Moses, though this (see Introduction) has lately been discarded for another hypothesis. But we have, if the present passage be genuine, a distinct proof that the Book of Joshua was written after the Book of Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy is here quoted as the "book of the law of Moses" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9, 24, 26</a>). The grounds on which the genuine. ness of the passage has been denied are these: First, the passage begins with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;</span> followed by an imperfect, or future, as does the interpolated passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-41.htm">Deuteronomy 4:41-43</a>. This is Maurer's theory. But in this case we must reject every passage which begins thus, and certainly we should do so on grounds which, to say the least, are very slender. Next, we are told that Joshua could not have ventured to trust himself so far in the heart of a hostile country. But why not? Gerizim was not more than twenty miles from Ai. The Canaanites, we are told, were panic stricken at Joshua's success. The Gibeonites were not disposed to offer any hindrance to his progress; on the contrary, they hastened to form an alliance with him. And these solemn religious rites, performed by a people so clearly under the protection of the Most High, were more likely to increase than lessen the awe felt by the surrounding tribes. The only difficulty is that the women and children (v. 35) are expressly said to have gone thither also, and it seems improbable that they, whom we have supposed to have been left under a guard at Gilgal, should have been brought so far while the country was as yet unsubdued. And the difficulty is increased by finding Joshua again at Gilgal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>. But there is the hypothesis that this was another Gilgal to fall back upon, and this (see note on the passage just mentioned) is an extremely probable one. The suggestion of many commentators, that the passage has been transposed, is of course possible. We can only leave the difficulty unsolved, as one which a fuller knowledge of the facts, could we obtain it, would clear up at once. But we may be sure that if the passage were an interpolation, some explanation would have been given of the circumstances which seem to us so perplexing. And on the other hand we must remember that, as has been already contended, the notion that the whole camp of Israel performed this journey at a time when stupefaction had seized upon the Canaanitish tribes, though involving some amount of impossibility, is by no means impossible. (See also note on ver. 33). A number of extraordinary interpretations of this passage have been given. A favourite Rabbinical interpretation (see note on next verse) was that this altar was erected on the very day on which the Israelites crossed the Jordan. This was of course a physical impossibility. Josephus, on the contrary, supposes that five years elapsed before its erection, while Rabbi Israel, in the Jerusalem Talmud, thinks that it was deferred until after the expiration of fourteen years, and after the land had been divided. So Masius <span class="accented">in loc.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In Mount Ebal.</span> Between it and Gerizim stood the city of Shechem, or Sychar, as it is called in St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4.htm">John 4</a>.
