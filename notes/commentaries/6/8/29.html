(Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-10.htm" title="The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.">Esther 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-13.htm" title="Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.">Esther 9:13</a>.)<p>Jericho and Ai are the only cities of Canaan of which the capture by Joshua is recorded in detail. Their capture stands in the narrative, as it was in fact, a specimen of the whole conquest of the Canaanite <span class= "ital">cities. </span>Two campaigns in like manner are recorded as specimens of Joshua’s battles with the enemy in the open field. In the capture of Jericho and in the southern campaign, the hand of God is more especially manifested. In the capture of Ai and in the northern campaign, the labour of Israel in the conflict is more prominent. The whole work is thus presented to us in a twofold aspect, as the work of Israel and the work of God.<p><span class= "bld">A great heap of stones.</span>—Not only the death, but the burial of the king of Ai is recorded, as also the burial of the five kings in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-27.htm" title="And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.">Joshua 10:27</a>. The same thing was done to Achan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-26.htm" title="And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger.
