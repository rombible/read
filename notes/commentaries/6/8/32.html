We must not think to defer covenanting with God till we are settled in the world; nor must any business put us from minding and pursuing the one thing needful. The way to prosper is to begin with God, Mt 6:33. They built an altar, and offered sacrifice to God, in token of their dedicating themselves to God, as living sacrifices to his honour, in and by a Mediator. By Christ's sacrifice of himself for us, we have peace with God. It is a great mercy to any people to have the law of God in writing, and it is fit that the written law should be in a known tongue, that it may be seen and read of all men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the note marginal reference.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses&#8212;(See on [185]De 27:2, 3, 5); that is, the blessings and curses of the law.

"The wall destined to receive the picture," and it was just the same with inscriptions - was covered with a coating of lime and gypsum plaster. The outline was then sketched with red chalk, and afterwards corrected and filled in with black (Keurick's 'Egypt,' 1, p. 271). Thomson ('Land and the Book,' Io. 471) says that he has seen writings in plaster which could not have been less than two thousand years old. This passage shows that our author had <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2, 3</a> in his mind. The stones of the altar, which alone have been mentioned, are clearly not meant here, but the erection of plastered stone on which the law was to be written. <span class="cmt_word">A copy of the law of Moses,</span> "Deuteronomium legis," Vulgate. So also LXX. Not the whole law, nor yet the Book of Deuteronomy, for time would not permit,but the decalogue, as the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> duplicate, from whence the word Mishna comes, signifies. It is to be observed that the word is definite, the copy, not a copy, of the law. This (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>) was what was written on the two tables of stone, which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>, 31:18) God gave to Moses. Yet it is possible that, as some commentaters suggest, and as ver. 34 may be held to imply, what is meant is the curses and blessings mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>, and 28. The formal setting up of this memorial was intended to remind the Israelites, by a perpetual standing witness, of the conditions on which they held the land of Canaan. And it is to be observed that the moral, rather than the positive, precepts of the law were thus solemnly enjoined on them, since neglect of the moral law of God is the invariable source of national degradation and decay. <span class="cmt_word">Which he wrote.</span> Namely, Joshua. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When all the men of Ai, who had come out to pursue the Israelites, had been slain upon the field (namely) in the desert, all Israel returned to Ai and smote it (the town, i.e., the inhabitants), so that on that day there fell of men and women, 12,000, all the people of Ai: for Joshua did not draw back his hand, which had been stretched out with the javelin, till all the inhabitants of Ai were smitten with the ban, i.e., put to death; according to the common custom of war, that the general did not lower the war-signal till the conflict was to cease (see Suidas in &#x3a3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;, and Lipsius de militia, Rom. iv. dial. 12).</body></html>
