God could by a sudden and miraculous frost have congealed the surface, so that they might all have gone over upon the ice; but that being a thing, it seems, sometimes done even in that country, by the ordinary power of nature, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-30.htm" title="The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.">Job 38:30</a>,) it would not have been such an honour to Israel’s God, nor such a terror to Israel’s enemies. It must therefore be done in such a way as had no precedent, but in the dividing of the Red sea. And that miracle is here repeated to show that God has the same power to <span class="ital">finish </span>that he had to <span class="ital">begin </span>the salvation of his people, for he is the Omega as well as the Alpha; and that the <span class="ital">word of the Lord, </span>(as the Chaldee reads it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.">Joshua 3:7</a>,) the essential word, was with Joshua as truly as he was with Moses.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 The waters of Jordan shall be cut off. This must be done in such a way as never was done, but in the dividing of the Red sea. That miracle is here repeated; God has the same power to finish the salvation of his people, as to begin it; the WORD of the Lord was as truly with Joshua as with Moses. God's appearances for his people ought to encourage faith and hope. God's work is perfect, he will keep his people.

The premonitory address of Joshua, taken in connection with the miraculous result exactly as he had described it, would tend to increase and confirm their faith in the God of their fathers as not a dull, senseless, inanimate thing like the idols of the nations, but a Being of life, power, and activity to defend them and work for them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Take you twelve men, </span> for the work described, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-2.htm" title="Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,">Joshua 4:2</a>,3</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore take ye twelve men,.... For what end and purpose is not mentioned. Abarbinel is of opinion, that they were chosen and appointed, that every man might pitch upon and take a place for his tribe to encamp in, when they came on the other side Jordan: whether this was Joshua's view or no is not certain; however, the use he made of these, thus provided by divine direction, is related <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-2.htm">Joshua 4:2</a>, <p>and these were to be taken out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man; Levi not reckoned, having no part in the land; and so we find that tribe left out in other accounts, when there was a choice of twelve men out of each of the tribes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-4.htm">Numbers 13:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now therefore take you <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</span><p>(e) Who would set up twelve stones in remembrance of the benefit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take you twelve men.</span> Joshua commands the election of twelve men previous to the passage of the Jordan, and in pursuance of the command he had already (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-2.htm">Joshua 4:2</a>; cf. note on ver. 2) received from God. The reason for which they were to be chosen was probably not communicated to the Israelites till after the passage had taken place. Masius thinks that it would make the narrative clearer, "si proximum is versiculum sequeretur." But see note on Joshua 4:1. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua then issued instructions (a) to the people to sanctify themselves, because on the morrow the Lord would do wonders among them; and (b) to the priests, to carry the ark of the covenant in front of the people. The issuing of these commands with the prediction of the miracle presupposes that the Lord had already made known His will to Joshua, and serves to confirm our conclusions as to the arrangement of the materials. The sanctification of the people did not consist in the washing of their clothes, which is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-14.htm">Exodus 19:14</a>, in connection with the act of sanctification, for there was no time for this; nor did it consist in merely changing their clothes, which might be a substitute for washing, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>, or in abstinence from connubial intercourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>), for this was only the outward side of sanctification. It consisted in spiritual purification also, i.e., in turning the heart to God, in faith and trust in His promise, and in willing obedience to His commandments, that they should lay to heart in a proper way the miracle of grace which the Lord was about to work in the midst of them and on their behalf on the following day. "Wonders:" those miraculous displays of the omnipotence of God for the realization of His covenant of grace, which He had already promised in connection with the conquest of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-10.htm">Exodus 34:10</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>, where the command to the priests is given, the fulfilment of the command is also mentioned, and the course of events anticipated in consequence. </body></html>
