This passage over Jordan, as an entrance to Canaan, after their long, weary wanderings in the wilderness, shadowed out the believer's passage through death to heaven, after he has finished his wanderings in this sinful world.

But the correction is needless. It is better to render, "they rose up, one heap, very far off, at the city Adam." The city Adam is nowhere else mentioned in Scripture, The LXX. appears to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;</span>, for it translates <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. This reading of the LXX. shows that the correction, though it obscures the sense, is of great antiquity, and that the site of Adam was then quite unknown. Knobel would place it either just south of the Jabbok, where the ford <span class="accented">Damieh</span> now exists, or at <span class="accented">Eduma</span>, now <span class="accented">Daumeh</span>, twelve German miles east of Neapolis. The former is generally accepted now, and Conder ('Handbook,' p. 241) identifies it with Admah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2</a>), in the plain or ciccar of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">That is beside Zaretan.</span> Called Zarthan in the original (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-46.htm">1 Kings 7:46</a>), and Zeredatha, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-17.htm">2 Chronicles 4:17</a>. Some read Zeredatha for Zererath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>. Knobel supposes, and not without some probability, that Zereda, Jeroboam's birthplace, is the same as this. It was in the plain of Jordan, not far from Succoth, at the mouth of the Jabbok. The LXX. here reads <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, either Kiriathaim or Kirjath-jearim, but without authority. Delitzsch and Knobel suppose the spot to be Kurn, or Karn (<span class="accented">i.e., horn</span>) Sartabeh, near the ford <span class="accented">Damieh</span>, where the Jordan valley is at its narrowest, and the rocks stretch forward so as almost to meet. They fix on this spot, partly from the suitability of the situation for such an arresting of the waters, partly from its agreement with the situation of Zarthan, as described in the Scriptures. Vandevelde agrees with them. There was an Adami and a Zartanath higher up the river near Bethshean, which some have supposed to be meant (see Joshua 19:83; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>), but these lay entirely out of Joshua's line of march. <span class="cmt_word">The sea of the plain.</span> Rather the sea of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;</span>, LXX.), or desert (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>). The term is applied by the Hebrews and Arabs to any sterile region, and thence to the sterile depression which borders on the Jordan, extending from the lake of Tiberias southward. The Arabs now apply the term <span class="accented">el ghor</span> to the part between Tiberias and the Dead Sea, and reserve the term Arabah for the desert valley, or wady, which extends thence to the Red Sea. So Gesen., 'Thesaurus,' s.v.; and Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.' The word translated <span class="accented">plain</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, a word of very different signification (see also 'Shephelah' and 'Emek,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The salt sea</span>. This sea is called the Dead Sea from the immobility of its waters, as well as from the apparent absence of all life within them. "Some of our party," says Canon Tristram," employed themselves in searching, but without avail, for life in the Dead Sea." It lies at a level of more than 1,300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its waters are thus described by Dr. Thomson: "The water is perfectly clear and transparent. The taste is bitter and salt, far beyond that of the ocean. It acts upon the tongue and mouth like alum; smarts in the eye like camphor; produces a burning, pricking sensation." The specific gravity of its waters is very great, and bathers find a great difficulty in swimming in it from the unusual buoyancy of the water. This is caused by the very large quantity of saline matter held in solution from the salt hills in the neighbourhood. One of them, Jebel Usdum, is described by Canon Tristram as "a solid mass of rock salt," and the water in its vicinity as "syrup of chloride of sodium," that is to say, of common salt. So also Bartlett, 'Egypt and Palestine,' p. 451. The statement that no bird can fly across its waters is a fable. The fullest account of the various attempts - some of them fatal - to explore the Dead Sea are to be found in Ritter's 'Geography of Palestine,' vol. 3. Canon Tristram explored the western side thoroughly, while Mr. Macgregor's canoe voyage, described in his 'Rob Roy on the Jordan,' gives a number of most interesting details. In Ritter's work will also be found some valuable observations on the physical geography of the district, on the geological formation of the basin of the Dead Sea, together with two papers, one by M. Terreil and the other by M. Lartet, on the chemical composition of the Dead Sea waters. <span class="cmt_word">Failed and were cut off.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">were completed, were cut off, i.e.</span>, were completely cut off, so that the supply of water failed, and the channel of the Jordan to the southward, and to the northward as far as Zaretan, became dry ground (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The summons to the children of Israel, i.e., to the whole nation in the persons of its representatives, to draw near (&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-38.htm">1 Samuel 14:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>) to hear the words of the Lord its God, points to the importance of the following announcement by which Israel was to learn that there was a living God in the midst of it, who had the power to fulfil His word. Jehovah is called a "living God," in contrast with the dead gods of the heathen, as a God who proved himself to be living, with special reference to those "divine operations by which God had shown that He was living and watchful on behalf of His people; just as His being in the midst of the people did not denote a naked presence, but a striking degree of presence on the part of God in relation to the performance of extraordinary operations, or the manifestation of peculiar care" (Seb. Schmidt). The God of Israel would now manifest himself as a living God by the extermination of the Canaanites, seven tribes of whom are enumerated, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a> (see the remarks on this passage). Joshua mentions the destruction of these nations as the purpose which God had in view in the miraculous guidance of Israel through the Jordan, to fill the Israelites with confidence for their entrance into the promised land.<p>(Note: "He extends the force of the miracle beyond their entrance into the land, and properly so, since the mere opening of a way into a hostile country from which there would be no retreat, would be nothing but exposure to death. For they would either easily fall, through being entangled in difficulties and in an unknown region, or they would perish through want. Joshua therefore foretold, that when God drove back the river it would be as if He had stretched out His hand to strike all the inhabitants of the land, and that the proof which He gave of His power in their crossing the Jordan would be a certain presage of victory, to be gained over all the tribes.")  </body></html>
