God's spiritual Israel have, and shall have in Christ and heaven, not only rest to repose in, but refuge to secure themselves in. These cities were designed to typify the relief which the gospel provides for penitent sinners, and their protection from the curse of the law and the wrath of God, in our Lord Jesus, to whom believers flee for refuge, Heb 6:18.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nothing is said of any express command of God respecting the inheritance of Joshua. But as such special portion appears to have been promised to Caleb at the time when he and Joshua alone out of the twelve spies remained faithful <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6-9</a>, it is probable that a like promise was made to Joshua. The name of the place is also written Timnath-heres <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm">Judges 2:9</a>, by a transposition of the letters. The rabbinical explanation that the name Timnath-heres (i. e. "portion of the sun") was given because a representation of the sun was affixed to the tomb in memory of Joshua's command to the sun to stand still, appears to be an afterthought. The name Timnath-serah ("portion that remains") was perhaps conferred on the spot in consequence of its being allotted to Joshua, the last allotment made in the whole distribution of his conquests. The site has been conjectured to be "Tibneh," a village about five miles north-west of Lydda (or, by Conder, Kerr Hares, nine miles south of Nablous). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 20<p>Jos 20:1-6. The Lord Commands the Cities of Refuge.<p>1-3. The Lord spake unto Joshua &#8230; Appoint out for you cities of refuge&#8212;(See Nu 35:9-28; De 19:1-13). The command here recorded was given on their going to occupy their allotted settlements. The sanctuaries were not temples or altars, as in other countries, but inhabited cities; and the design was not to screen criminals, but only to afford the homicide protection from the vengeance of the deceased's relatives until it should have been ascertained whether the death had resulted from accident and momentary passion, or from premeditated malice. The institution of the cities of refuge, together with the rules prescribed for the guidance of those who sought an asylum within their walls, was an important provision, tending to secure the ends of justice as well as of mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unawares and unwittingly, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">through ignorance, or error, or mistake, and without knowledge</span>; the same thing twice repeated, to cut off all the claims and expectations that wilful murderers might have of protection here; and God having declared that such should be taken even from his altar, that they might be killed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm" title="But if a man come presumptuously on his neighbor, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.">Exodus 21:14</a></span>; and accordingly Joab was by Solomon’s order killed even at the altar, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/2-28.htm" title="Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom.

(<span class="ital">a</span>) In the former case the guilty criminal met with no compassion from the Mosaic Code. He was regarded as accursed. The horns of the altar were to be no refuge for him. He was to be dragged from them by force to suffer his doom, nor could rank or wealth exempt him from it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/35-31.htm" title="Moreover you shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death....">Numbers 35:31-32</a>). (<span class="ital">b</span>) In the latter case, where life had been taken unawares, a more merciful system of legislation intervened. In contradistinction to the customs of the Greeks and Romans and even of the Middle Ages, which made places of sanctuary available to <span class="ital">criminals of every kind</span>, the Jewish Lawgiver reserved them for unintentional acts of murder, and for these alone. The distinguishing marks of such acts are clearly laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/35-25.htm" title="And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, where he was fled: and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil....">Numbers 35:25-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/19-4.htm" title="And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;...">Deuteronomy 19:4-6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from the avenger of blood</span>] “that he moue ascaap the wrath of the neiзboure, that is wreker of the blood,” Wyclif. The involuntary shedder of blood was permitted to take flight to a city of refuge.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span>  -  <span class="cmt_word">Unawares and unwittingly.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">in error, in not knowing.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16-18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>, give a clear explanation of what is here meant. Knobel notices that the first of these expressions is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a>, and the second in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-42.htm">Deuteronomy 4:42</a>. The latter is "superfluous," and therefore a "filling up of the Deuteronomist." The "Deuteronomist" must have been very active in his "filling up." If he were really so lynx-eyed in a matter of style, it is a wonder that he was so careless, as we are told he is, in matters of fact. To more ordinary minds it would seem as if the author, familiar with the books of Moses, was quoting Deuteronomy for the precept, and Leviticus for the nature of the offence. <span class="cmt_word">The avenger of blood.</span> The Hebrew word is worthy of notice. It is Goel; that is, literally, <span class="accented">redeemer</span>, one who buys back at the appointed price what has fallen into other hands, as a farm, a field, a slave, or anything consecrated to God. Hence, since the duly of such redemption, on the death of the owner, devolved upon the nearest relative, it came to mean "blood relation." Thus Boaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1, 6, 8</a>) is called the Goel of Elimelech and his widow. In the present passage, the phrase "the redeemer (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> next of kin) of the blood" signifies the exactor of the only penalty which can satisfy justice, namely, the death of the murderer. So we are taught in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-17.htm">Leviticus 24:17, 21</a>. This duty, which in civilised society belongs to the government, in uncivilised tribes is usually left to the relatives of the murdered man. Hence the terrible blood feuds which have raged between families for generations, and which are not only to be found among savage nations, but even in countries which lay claim to civilisation. In Ireland, for instance, it is not so long ago since one of these blood feuds in the county Tipperary had acquired such formidable proportions that the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church there were compelled to resort to a mission in order to put an end to it. A man had been killed nearly a century before in an affray which commenced about the age of a colt. His relatives felt bound to avenge the murder, and their vengeance was again deemed to require fresh vengeance, until faction fights between the "Three-Year-Olds" and the "Four-Year-Olds" had grown almost into petty wars. A thrilling story written by the late Prosper Merimee turns upon the Corsican <span class="accented">vendetta</span>, and so true is this story to life that in the very year (1879) in which these words were written an occurrence precisely similar, save in its termination, was reported in the daily journals to have taken place in that island. The only way in which the feud could be terminated was by summoning the representatives of the two families before the authorities and exacting an oath from them that they would cease their strife. It is no small corroboration of the Divine origin of the Mosaic law that we find here a provision for mitigating the evils of this rude code, and for at least delivering the accidental homicide from the penalty of this law of retaliation. Yet for the offence of wilful murder the penalties enjoined by the Jewish law were terribly severe. A deliberate violation of the sanctity of human life was an offence for which no palliation could be pleaded. No right of sanctuary was to be granted to him who had wantonly slain a fellow creature. "No satisfaction" was to be taken for his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>). "The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, save by the blood of him that shed it" (ver. 33). Such provisions might be expected of a lawgiver who had laid down as the fundamental principle of humanity that man was created "in the image of God," after His likeness; that God had "breathed the breath of life" into him, and man had thus "become a living soul" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Such inward harmony is there between Moses' inspired revelations concerning God's purpose in creation, and the precepts he was commanded to deliver to the children of Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Besides this inheritance, the Danites of Zorea and Eshtaol went, after Joshua's death, and conquered the town of Leshem or Laish, on the northern boundary of Canaan, and gave it the name of Dan, as the territory which was allotted to them under Joshua was too small for them, on account of their inability to drive out the Amorites from several of their towns (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a>).

Res. pp. 390, 393). It was there that Jeroboam set up the golden calves (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29-30</a>, etc.); and it is frequently mentioned as the northernmost city of the Israelites, in contrast with Beersheba, which was in the extreme south of the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-10.htm">2 Samuel 3:10</a> : see also Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 207ff.). </body></html>
