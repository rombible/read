When the land was distributed among the tribes according to its territories, the Israelites gave Joshua an inheritance in the midst of them, according to the command of Jehovah, namely the town of Timnath-serah, upon the mountains of Ephraim, for which he asked, and which he finished building; and there he dwelt until the time of his death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-30.htm">Joshua 24:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm">Judges 2:9</a>). "According to the word of the Lord" (lit. "at the mouth of Jehovah") does not refer to a divine oracle communicated through the high priest, but to a promise which Joshua had probably received from God at the same time as Caleb, viz., in Kadesh, but which, like the promise given to Caleb, is not mentioned in the Pentateuch (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-9.htm">Joshua 14:9</a>). Timnath-serah, called Timnath-heres in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm">Judges 2:9</a>, must not be confounded with Timnah in the tribe of Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-43.htm">Joshua 19:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>), as is the case in the Onom. It has been preserved in the present ruins and foundation walls of a place called Tibneh, which was once a large town, about seven hours to the north of Jerusalem, and two hours to the west of Jiljilia, standing upon two mountains, with many caverns that have been used as graves (see Eli Smith in Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 562ff., and Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 141). </body></html>
