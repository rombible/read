God's spiritual Israel have, and shall have in Christ and heaven, not only rest to repose in, but refuge to secure themselves in. These cities were designed to typify the relief which the gospel provides for penitent sinners, and their protection from the curse of the law and the wrath of God, in our Lord Jesus, to whom believers flee for refuge, Heb 6:18.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As soon as the manslayer presented himself at the city of refuge, the elders of the city were to hold an inquiry, and receive him provisionally into the city.

If found guilty, the manslayer was surrendered to the blood-avenger; if extenuating circumstances appeared, he was to remain in the city of refuge, where he would be safe from the vindictive feelings of his pursuers; but he forfeited the privilege of immunity the moment he ventured beyond the walls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if the avenger of blood pursue after him,....

The former was not designed to save the criminal from the penalty he had deserved, but only the victim of an accident from consequences far exceeding the offence. The Greeks and Romans, on the contrary, provided the real criminal with a mode of escape from a punishment which he had justly merited. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Conclusion of the Distribution of the Land. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-49.htm">Joshua 19:49</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-50.htm">Joshua 19:50</a>. When the land was distributed among the tribes according to its territories, the Israelites gave Joshua an inheritance in the midst of them, according to the command of Jehovah, namely the town of Timnath-serah, upon the mountains of Ephraim, for which he asked, and which he finished building; and there he dwelt until the time of his death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-30.htm">Joshua 24:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm">Judges 2:9</a>). "According to the word of the Lord" (lit. "at the mouth of Jehovah") does not refer to a divine oracle communicated through the high priest, but to a promise which Joshua had probably received from God at the same time as Caleb, viz., in Kadesh, but which, like the promise given to Caleb, is not mentioned in the Pentateuch (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-9.htm">Joshua 14:9</a>). Timnath-serah, called Timnath-heres in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm">Judges 2:9</a>, must not be confounded with Timnah in the tribe of Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-43.htm">Joshua 19:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>), as is the case in the Onom. It has been preserved in the present ruins and foundation walls of a place called Tibneh, which was once a large town, about seven hours to the north of Jerusalem, and two hours to the west of Jiljilia, standing upon two mountains, with many caverns that have been used as graves (see Eli Smith in Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 562ff., and Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 141). </body></html>
