Cain, or Hakain, "that Cain", we nowhere else read of; whether the name was given it by the old Canaanites, in memory of Cain, the son of Adam, is not certain: <p>Gibeah; there were other places that went by the name of Gibeah; there was a Gibeah in Benjamin, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-4.htm">Judges 20:4</a>, and another in the same tribe called Gibeah of Saul, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-4.htm">1 Samuel 11:4</a>, to distinguish it from that; but this was in the tribe of Judah. Masius conjectures it is the same with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19</a> which was near Ziph; and not amiss.
