The town is repeatedly mentioned with its haven in the wars of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 4:15; 2 Macc. 12:8), and by Josephus under the name of Jamnia. It is described by Philo as a very populous town; and after the destruction of Jerusalem was, for a long time, the seat of the Sanhedrin, and was a famous school of Jewish learning. Its ruins, which are still considerable, stand on the brink of the "Wady Rubin". <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

This important Philistine city (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>) lay close to the northern border of Judah. As a matter of fact, however, the tribe of Judah never succeeded in permanently occupying this territory, which only fell under their yoke during the reigns of David and Solomon. The cities of the Philistines were, it is true, most of them captured (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-18.htm">Judges 1:18</a>), but we soon find the Philistines once more in possession of them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Northward</span>. The border turned sharply northward until past Ekron, when it once more turned westward until it reached the sea. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The eastern boundary was the salt sea to the end of the Jordan," i.e., the Dead Sea, in all its length up to the point where the Jordan entered it.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-5.htm">Joshua 15:5-11</a><p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-5.htm">Joshua 15:5-11</a> we have a description of the northern boundary, which is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-15.htm">Joshua 18:15-19</a> as the southern boundary of Benjamin, though in the opposite direction, namely, from west to east. It started "from the tongue of the (salt) sea, the end (i.e., the mouth) of the Jordan, and went up to Beth-hagla," - a border town between Judah and Benjamin, which was afterwards allotted to the latter (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-19.htm">Joshua 18:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-12.htm">Joshua 18:12</a>), the present Ain Hajla, an hour and a quarter to the south-east of Riha (Jericho), and three-quarters of an hour from the Jordan (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-11.htm">Genesis 50:11</a>, note), - "and went over to the north side of Beth-arabah," a town in the desert of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-61.htm">Joshua 15:61</a>), afterwards assigned to Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-22.htm">Joshua 18:22</a>), and called Ha-arabah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-18.htm">Joshua 18:18</a>, about twenty or thirty minutes to the south-west of Ain Hajla, in a "level and barren steppe" (Seetzen, R. ii. p. 302), with which the name very well agrees (see also Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 268ff.). "And the border went up to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben." The expression "went up" shows that the stone of Bohan must have been on higher ground, i.e., near the western mountains, though the opposite expression "went down" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a> shows that it must have been by the side of the mountain, and not upon the top. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-18.htm">Joshua 18:18-19</a>, the border went over from the stone of Bohan in an easterly direction "to the shoulder over against (Beth) Arabah northwards, and went down to (Beth) Arabah, and then went over to the shoulder of Beth-hagla northwards," i.e., on the north side of the mountain ridge of Beth-arabah and Beth-hagla. This ridge is "the chain of hills or downs which runs from Kasr Hajla towards the south to the north side of the Dead Sea, and is called Katar Hhadije, i.e., a row of camels harnessed together."</body></html>
