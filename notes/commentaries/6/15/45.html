One of the five principalities of the Philistines, which with two more next mentioned, though they fell to the lot of the tribe of Judah, were never possessed by them; for which reason perhaps Gath and Ascalon are not mentioned, and these are put for the rest; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ekron, with her towns and her villages:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">45</span>. <span class="ital">Ekron.

These cities of the Philistines had, like Gibeon, daughter cities dependent on them, and must therefore have been, like Gibeon, "great cities as the royal cities" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>). They do not appear to have come under regal government till later times (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8, 11</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>). "Around it (Gezer) and along the sides were distributed a series of small isolated centres of agglomeration .... This disposition to scatter itself, of which Gezer surely does not offer us the only specimen, explains in a striking manner the Biblical phrase, 'the city and her daughters'" (Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper, Jan., 1874). This explanation, however, is doubtful (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>). According to Knobel, this passage cannot have been written by the Elohist, because he confines himself to the description of the cities the Israelites actually possessed. Why a lair writer, writing presumably when Israel's fortunes were at a lower ebb, should have added a description of the territory Israel <span class="accented">did not</span> possess, he does not explain. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Lachish, i.e., Um Lakis (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>).
