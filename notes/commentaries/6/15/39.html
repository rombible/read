It is still tolerably well cultivated, and is covered with villages, which are situated for the most part upon the different hills. Towards the south, the shephelah was bounded by the Negeb _(<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>); on the north, it reached to Ramleh and Lydda, or Diospolis, where the plain of Sharon began, - a plain which extended as far as Carmel, and was renowned for the beauty of its flowers. Towards the east the hills multiply and shape themselves into a hilly landscape, which forms the intermediate link between the mountains and the plain, and which is distinguished from the shephelah itself, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/12-8.htm">Joshua 12:8</a>, under the name of Ashedoth, or slopes, whereas here it is reckoned as forming part of the shephelah. This hilly tract is more thickly studded with villages than even the actual plain (See Rob. Pal. ii. p. 363, and iii. p. 29.) The towns in the shephelah are divided into four groups.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33-36</a><p>The first group contains the towns in the northern part of the hilly region or slopes, which are reckoned as forming part of the lowland: in all, fourteen towns. The most northerly part of this district was given up to the tribe of Dan on the second division (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>.). Eshtaol and Zoreah, which were assigned to the tribe of Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>), and were partly inhabited by Danites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-8.htm">Judges 18:8</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11</a>) and partly by families of Judah, who had gone out from Kirjath-jearim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-53.htm">1 Chronicles 1:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-2.htm">1 Chronicles 4:2</a>), probably after the removal of the 600 Danites to Laish-Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>), were situated, according to the Onom. (s. v. Esthaul and Saara), ten Roman miles to the north of Eleutheropolis, on the road to Nicopolis. Zoreah, the home of Samson, who was buried between Zoreah and Eshtaol (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-31.htm">Judges 16:31</a>), was fortified by Rehoboam, and still inhabited by Judaeans after the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>); it has been preserved in the ruins of Sur, at the south-western end of the mountain range which bounds the Wady es Surar on the north (Rob. ii. p. 341, and Bibl. Res. p. 153). Eshtaol has probably been preserved in Um Eshteiyeh, to the south-west (Rob. ii. p. 342). Ashnah is possibly to be read Ashvah, according to the lxx, Cod. Vat. (&#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;). In that case it might resemble a town on the east of Zorea (Tobler, p. 180), as Knobel supposes.</body></html>
