But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This highland district extends from the Negeb on the south to Jerusalem, and is bounded by the Shephelah on the west, and the "wilderness" <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-61.htm">Joshua 15:61-62</a> on the east. The mountains, which are of limestone, rise to a height of near 3,000 feet. At present, the highlands of Judah present a somewhat dreary and monotonous aspect. The peaks are for the most part barren, though crowned almost everywhere with the ruins of ancient towns, and bearing on their sides marks of former cultivation. Many of the valleys, especially toward the south, are, however, still very productive. The towns here enumerated are given in six groups.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48-51</a><p>First group: towns on the southwest. Dannah (is identified with "Idnah" (Conder)).

Cities of Judah.<p>21-63. the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah&#8212;There is given a list of cities within the tribal territory of Judah, arranged in four divisions, corresponding to the districts of which it consisted&#8212;the cities in the southern part (Jos 15:21-32), those in the lowlands (Jos 15:33-47), those in the highlands (Jos 15:48-60), and those in the desert (Jos 15:61, 62). One gets the best idea of the relative situation of these cities by looking at the map.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Anab,....

App.), as they lie to the south of the mountains of Hebron, whereas Keilah is to be sought for in the shephelah, or at all events to the west or south-west of the mountains of Hebron. Achzib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>), the same as Chesib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5</a>), has been preserved in the ruins at Kussbeh, a place with a fountain (Rob. ii. p. 391), i.e., the fountain of Kesba, about five hours south by west from Beit-jibrin. Mareshah, which was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>), and was the place where Asa defeated Zerah the Ethiopian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>), the home of Eliezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a>), and afterwards the important town of Marissa (see v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 211-12), was between Hebron and Ashdod, since Judas Maccabaeus is represented in 1 Macc. 5:65-68 (where the reading should be &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; instead of &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, according to Joseph. Ant. xii. 8, 6) as going from Hebron through Marissa into the land of the Philistines, and turning to Ashdod. According to the Onom. (s. v. Mareshah), it was lying in ruins in the time of Eusebius, and was about two Roman miles from Eleutheropolis-a description which applies exactly to the ruins of Maresh, twenty-four minutes to the south of Beit-jibrin, which Robinson supposes for this reason to be Maresa (Rob. ii. p. 422), whereas Knobel finds it in Beit-mirsim, a place four hours to the south of Beit-jibrin.<p>(Note: Knobel founds his opinion partly upon <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>, according to which Mareshah was in the valley of Zephatah, which is the bason-like plain at Mirsim, and partly upon the fact that the Onom. also places Moraste on the east (south-east) of Eleutheropolis; and Jerome (ad Mich. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>) describes Morasthi as haud grandem viculum juxta Eleutheropolin, and as sepulcrum quondam Micheae prophetae nunc ecclesiam (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/108.htm">Ephesians 108</a> ad Eustoch. 14); and this ecclesia is in all probability the ruins of a church called Santa Hanneh, twenty minutes to the south-east of Beit-jibrin, and only ten minutes to the east of Marash, which makes the assumption a very natural one, that the Maresa and Morasthi of the fathers are only different parts of the same place, viz., of Moreseth-gath, the home of Micah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-1.htm">Micah 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>). But neither of these is decisive. The valley of Zephatah might be the large open plain which Robinson mentions (ii. p. 355) near Beit-jibrin; and the conjecture that Morasthi, which Euseb. and Jer. place &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;, contra orientem Eleutheropoleos, is preserved in the ruins which lie in a straight line towards the south from Beit-jibrin, and are called Marash, has not much probability in it.)</body></html>
