He gave her a south land. Land indeed, but a south land, dry and apt to be parched. She obtained more, on her request, and he gave the upper and the nether springs. Those who understand it but of one field, watered both with the rain of heaven, and the springs that issued out of the earth, countenance the allusion commonly made to this, when we pray for spiritual and heavenly blessings which relate to our souls, as blessings of the upper springs, and those which relate to the body and the life that now is, as blessings of the nether springs. All the blessings, both of the upper and the nether springs, belong to the children of God. As related to Christ, they have them freely given of the Father, for the lot of their inheritance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A south land - This term ("negeb") which is often equivalent to a proper name <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>, importing the well-defined district which formed the south of the promised land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a> note), seems here used in its more general sense <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/126-4.htm">Psalm 126:4</a>, for a dry or barren land. The rendering of this passage adopted by Septuagint, several versions, and Commentators, etc., "thou hast given me into a south land," i. e. "hast given me in marriage into a south land" is forced; the construction of the verb "to give," with two accusatives, is natural and common to many languages.<p>Springs of water - The Hebrew words &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1500;&#1492;  gu&#770;lla&#770;h may&#305;&#770;m are found only here and in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>.

She suddenly alighted from her travelling equipage&#8212;a mark of respect to her father, and a sign of making some request. She had urged Othniel to broach the matter, but he not wishing to do what appeared like evincing a grasping disposition, she resolved herself to speak out. Taking advantage of the parting scene when a parent's heart was likely to be tender, she begged (as her marriage portion consisted of a field which, having a southern exposure, was comparatively an arid and barren waste) he would add the adjoining one, which abounded in excellent springs. The request being reasonable, it was granted; and the story conveys this important lesson in religion, that if earthly parents are ready to bestow on their children that which is good, much more will our heavenly Father give every necessary blessing to them who ask Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Give me a blessing, </span> i.e. a gift, as that word signifies, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-11.htm" title="Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.

The word Negeb signifies dry (see note on Negeb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>). It must be remembered that it became the word for south, because the south of Palestine was an arid tract. Therefore Achsah must be understood as saying, "Thou hast given me a dry country, give me also a reservoir of water." The Vulgate translates Negeb twice over, "australem et arentem" (arentem only <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>). The LXX. translates both Negeb and Gulloth as proper names.
