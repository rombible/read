The mountains, which are of limestone, rise to a height of near 3,000 feet. At present, the highlands of Judah present a somewhat dreary and monotonous aspect. The peaks are for the most part barren, though crowned almost everywhere with the ruins of ancient towns, and bearing on their sides marks of former cultivation. Many of the valleys, especially toward the south, are, however, still very productive. The towns here enumerated are given in six groups.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48-51</a><p>First group: towns on the southwest.

For the statement, that the "Elohist" merely mentions those towns of which the Hebrews had taken possession, and which they held either partially or wholly in his own day, and also that his list of the places belonging to Judah in the shephelah never goes near the sea, are assertions without the least foundation, which are proved to be erroneous by the simple fact, that according to the express statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-12.htm">Joshua 15:12</a>, the Mediterranean Sea formed the western boundary of the tribe of Judah; and according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>, Joshua was to distribute by lot even those parts of Canaan which had not yet been conquered. The difference, however, which actually exists between the verses before us and the other groups of towns, namely, that in this case the "towns" (or daughters) are mentioned as well as the villages, and that the towns are not summed up at the end, may be sufficiently explained from the facts themselves, namely, from the circumstance that the Philistine cities mentioned were capitals of small principalities, which embraced not only villages, but also small towns, and for that very reason did not form connected groups, like the towns of the other districts.)<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-45.htm">Joshua 15:45</a><p>Ekron, i.e., Akir (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>).
