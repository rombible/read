If it be the same as Moresheth-Gath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>, this adds additional probability to the identification of Gath with Beit-Jibrin (see note on Joshua 13:3). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Dilean is unknown; for Bet Dula, three full hours to the east of Beit-jibrin, with some relics of antiquity (Tobler, pp. 150-1), with which Knobel identifies it, is upon the mountains and not in the plain. Mizpeh, i.e., specula, a different place from the Mizpeh of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>), was on the north of Eleutheropolis, according to the Onom. (s. v. Maspha), and therefore may possibly be the castle Alba Specula, or Alba Custodia of the middle ages, the present Tell es Saphieh, in the middle of the plain and upon the top of a lofty hill, from which there is an extensive prospect in all directions (see Rob. ii. p. 363). Joktheel has possibly been preserved in the ruins of Keitulaneh (Rob. Pal. iii. App.), which are said to lie in that neighbourhood.</body></html>
