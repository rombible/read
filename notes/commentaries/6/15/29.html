But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Baalah <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-3.htm">Joshua 19:3</a> is found in the modern "Deir-el-Belah", near Gaza. Iim, i. e. "ruinous heaps" or "conical hills" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-11.htm">Numbers 21:11</a> note) is by some connected with Azem; and the compound name, "Ije Azem", is traced in El-Aujeh, in the country of the Azazimeh Arabs, in whose name the ancient Azem may perhaps be traced. Eltolad is connected with "Wady-el-Thoula", in the extreme south of the Negeb. Chesil appears to be the town called Bethul <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>, and probably the Bethel <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-27.htm">1 Samuel 30:27</a> situated not far from Ziklag. The name Chesil ( "fool") was most likely bestowed by way of opprobrium (compare the change of Bethel, house of God, into Bethaven, house of vanity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>). As Chesil signifies the group of stars known as Orion (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>), probably it was the worship of the heavenly bodies in particular that was carried on here. Bethel may have been the ancient name, and the spot was perhaps the very one near Beer-sheba where Abraham planted a tamarisk tree <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>.<p>The place is probably "El Khulasah", the Elusa of ecclesiastical writers, situated some fifteen miles southwest of Beer-sheba. Jerome testifies to the fact, that the worship of Venus as the morning star was practiced there, and Sozomen appears to be speaking of this place, when he mentions a Bethel &#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  Be&#772;thelia in the territory of Gaza, populous and famous for an ancient and splendid temple. The site of Ziklag is uncertain. Madmannah and Sansannah correspond to Beth-marcaboth ( "house of chariots") and Hazar-susah ("horse enclosure") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-5.htm">Joshua 19:5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-31.htm">1 Chronicles 4:31</a>. The latter names point to two stations of passage on or near the high road between Egypt and Palestine, and are represented by the modern "Minyay" and "Wady-es-Suny", on the caravan route south of Gaza. Shilhim or Sharuhen, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-6.htm">Joshua 19:6</a>, and Shaaraim <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-31.htm">1 Chronicles 4:31</a> is traced in "Khirbet-es-Seram", near El Aujeh. Ain and Rimmon were possibly originally two towns, but in process of time became so connected as to be treated as one name <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>. The place is probably the present "Um-er-Rummamim," i. e. "mother of pomegranates," a place about ten miles north of Beer-sheba.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 15:21-63. Cities of Judah.<p>21-63. the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah&#8212;There is given a list of cities within the tribal territory of Judah, arranged in four divisions, corresponding to the districts of which it consisted&#8212;the cities in the southern part (Jos 15:21-32), those in the lowlands (Jos 15:33-47), those in the highlands (Jos 15:48-60), and those in the desert (Jos 15:61, 62).
