But it is extremely like a reminiscence of the language of Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm" title="Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:">Numbers 34:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-6.htm" title="And as for the western border, you shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.">Numbers 34:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-9.htm" title="And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.">Numbers 34:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-12.htm" title="And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.">Numbers 34:12</a>. “This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth” was the instruction to Joshua, and in describing the border of Judah, he is really describing also the southern border of all Israel; and he does it throughout in language very like that of Moses in Numbers 34. But Moses wrote it in the second person and in the future tense throughout; Joshua wrote it in the third person and in the past tense, with this one exception, in which he seems to have unconsciously adopted the phraseology of the lawgiver instead of the historian.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-12 Joshua allotted to Judah, Ephraim, and the half of Manasseh, their inheritances before they left Gilgal.

"Westward, as far as Egypt, there is a sandy, salt, barren, unfruitful, and uninhabitable waste" (Knobel).
