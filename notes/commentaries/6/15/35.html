But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"The valley" or the Shephelah, is bounded on the south by the Negeb, on the west by the Mediterranean, on the north by the plain of Sharon, on the east by "the mountains" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>. It is a well-defined district, of an undulating surface and highly fertile character, thickly dotted, even at the present time, with villages, which are for the most part situated on the different hills. The towns in this district, like those in the Negeb, are classed in four groups.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33-36</a><p>First group of fourteen towns: these belong to the northeastern portion of the Shephelah. Eshtaol and Zoreah were afterward assigned to the tribe of Dan, and inhabited by Danites <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-8.htm">Judges 18:8</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11</a>. The latter place was the home of Samson <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2</a>. It was one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>, and was re-occupied by the Jews after the captivity <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>. It is probably the modern Surah. (Eshtaol has been identified with Eshua (Conder)). Both places were in later times partly populated by Judahites from Kirjath-jearim; perhaps after the departure of the colony of Danites for Dan-Laish. Zanoah is the present "Zanna", not far from Surah. Socoh is the modern "Shuweikah". Sharaim is perhaps to be sought in the modern "Zakariya". Gederah ("wall" or "fortress") was a name borne with various terminations by several places.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 15:21-63.
