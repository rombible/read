It is a well-defined district, of an undulating surface and highly fertile character, thickly dotted, even at the present time, with villages, which are for the most part situated on the different hills. The towns in this district, like those in the Negeb, are classed in four groups.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33-36</a><p>First group of fourteen towns: these belong to the northeastern portion of the Shephelah.

It was one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>, and was re-occupied by the Jews after the captivity <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>. It is probably the modern Surah. (Eshtaol has been identified with Eshua (Conder)). Both places were in later times partly populated by Judahites from Kirjath-jearim; perhaps after the departure of the colony of Danites for Dan-Laish. Zanoah is the present "Zanna", not far from Surah. Socoh is the modern "Shuweikah". Sharaim is perhaps to be sought in the modern "Zakariya". Gederah ("wall" or "fortress") was a name borne with various terminations by several places.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 15:21-63.
