But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A south land - This term ("negeb") which is often equivalent to a proper name <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>, importing the well-defined district which formed the south of the promised land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a> note), seems here used in its more general sense <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/126-4.htm">Psalm 126:4</a>, for a dry or barren land. The rendering of this passage adopted by Septuagint, several versions, and Commentators, etc., "thou hast given me into a south land," i. e. "hast given me in marriage into a south land" is forced; the construction of the verb "to give," with two accusatives, is natural and common to many languages.<p>Springs of water - The Hebrew words &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1500;&#1492;  gu&#770;lla&#770;h may&#305;&#770;m are found only here and in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>.

The tract in question was no doubt a mountain slope which had springs both on its higher and lower ground; possibly the modern "Kurmul". <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18, 19. as she came unto him&#8212;that is, when about to remove from her father's to her husband's house. She suddenly alighted from her travelling equipage&#8212;a mark of respect to her father, and a sign of making some request. She had urged Othniel to broach the matter, but he not wishing to do what appeared like evincing a grasping disposition, she resolved herself to speak out. Taking advantage of the parting scene when a parent's heart was likely to be tender, she begged (as her marriage portion consisted of a field which, having a southern exposure, was comparatively an arid and barren waste) he would add the adjoining one, which abounded in excellent springs. The request being reasonable, it was granted; and the story conveys this important lesson in religion, that if earthly parents are ready to bestow on their children that which is good, much more will our heavenly Father give every necessary blessing to them who ask Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah, according to their families.

The territory of Judah, in average length about 45 miles and in average breadth about 50, was from a very early period divided into four main regions—(i) the South; (ii) the Lowland; (iii) the Mountain; (iv) the Wilderness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">α</span>)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">The South</span> was the undulating pasture country which intervened between the hills, the proper possession of the tribe, and the desert country which marks the lower part of Palestine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">β</span>)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">The Lowland</span>, or, to give it its proper name, the <span class="ital">Shephelah</span>, was a broad strip of land lying between the central mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. From the edge of the sandy tract which fringes the immediate shore it stretched up to the bases of the hills of Judah—the garden and granary of the tribe—and formed the lower part of the maritime plain which extended along the whole seaboard of Palestine from “the river of Egypt” to Sidon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">γ</span>)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">The Mountain</span>, or “the Hill Country,” though not the richest, was at once the largest and the most important of the four. “Beginning a few miles below Hebron, where it attains its highest level, it stretches eastward to the Dead Sea and westward to <span class="ital">the Shephelah</span>, and forms an elevated district or plateau, which, though thrown into considerable undulations, yet preserves a general level in both directions.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">δ</span>)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">The Wilderness, Midbah</span>, which here, and here only, is synonymous with <span class="ital">Arâbah</span>, represents the sunken district adjoining the Dead Sea.

Instead of Caleb, we find the sons of Judah (Judaeans) generally mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-10.htm">Judges 1:10</a> as the persons who drove out the Anakites, according to the plan of the history in that book, to describe the conflicts in which the several tribes engaged with the Canaanites. But the one does not preclude the other. Caleb did not take Hebron as an individual, but as the head of a family of Judaeans, and with their assistance. Nor is there any discrepancy between this account and the fact stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21-22</a>, that Joshua had already conquered Hebron, Debir, and all the towns of that neighbourhood, and had driven out the Anakites from the mountains of Judah, and forced them back into the towns of the Philistines, as Knobel fancies. For that expulsion did not preclude the possibility of the Anakites and Canaanites returning to their former abodes, and taking possession of the towns again, when the Israelitish army had withdrawn and was engaged in the war with the Canaanites of the north; so that when the different tribes were about to settle in the towns and districts allotted to them, they were obliged to proceed once more to drive out or exterminate the Anakites and Canaanites who had forced their way in again (see the remarks on <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-38.htm">Joshua 10:38-39</a>, p. 86, note).</body></html>
