Jerom says (y), there was a very large village of Jews in his time called Engaddi, near the dead sea, from whence comes the opobalsam; the same place is called Hazazontamar, from the palm trees which grew there, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>.

Here the ruins of the ancient city of Hazezon Tamar, or "the felling of the palm trees" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>), are to be found, a city perhaps "the oldest in the world," may still be seen. "The cluster of camphire" (or rather of henna, the plant with which Oriental women stained their nails - <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-14.htm">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>) may still be found there, and its perennial torrent dashes still into the Dead Sea.
