Those who understand it but of one field, watered both with the rain of heaven, and the springs that issued out of the earth, countenance the allusion commonly made to this, when we pray for spiritual and heavenly blessings which relate to our souls, as blessings of the upper springs, and those which relate to the body and the life that now is, as blessings of the nether springs. All the blessings, both of the upper and the nether springs, belong to the children of God.

The valley of Ben-hinnom, or Ben-hinnom (the son or sons of Hinnom), on the south side of Mount Zion, a place which was notorious from the time of Ahaz as the seat of the worship of Moloch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, etc.), is supposed there, but of whom nothing further is known (see Robinson, Pal. i. pp. 402ff.).

It runs southwards to Mar Elias, is an hour long, half an hour broad, and was very fertile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a>); in fact, even to the present day it is carefully cultivated (see Rob. Pal. i. p. 323; Tobler, Topogr. v. Jerus. ii. pp. 401ff.). It is bounded on the north by the mountain ridge already mentioned, which curves westwards on the left side of the road to Jaffa. This mountain ridge, or one of the peaks, is "the mountain on the west of the valley of Hinnom," at the northern end of the plain referred to.</body></html>
