He gave her a south land. Land indeed, but a south land, dry and apt to be parched. She obtained more, on her request, and he gave the upper and the nether springs. Those who understand it but of one field, watered both with the rain of heaven, and the springs that issued out of the earth, countenance the allusion commonly made to this, when we pray for spiritual and heavenly blessings which relate to our souls, as blessings of the upper springs, and those which relate to the body and the life that now is, as blessings of the nether springs. All the blessings, both of the upper and the nether springs, belong to the children of God. As related to Christ, they have them freely given of the Father, for the lot of their inheritance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Othniel was probably Caleb's younger brother; the expression "son of Kenaz" being only an equivalent for the "Kenezite" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 15:16-20.

The relation of Othniel to Caleb is a little intricate, and, as it is understood, occasions objections to the marriage of Caleb's daughter to him; it seems, at first sight, that he was Caleb's own brother, a younger brother, and so uncle to his daughter, and such marriages were forbidden, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-14.htm">Leviticus 18:14</a>. Jarchi thinks he was the brother of Caleb by his mother's side; Kimchi, both by father and mother's side; but not to observe, that besides the word "brother" sometimes signifies only a kinsman, or near relation, and not precisely a brother; it is not Othniel that is called the brother of Caleb, but Kenaz, who was the father of Othniel; so that Caleb was Othniel's uncle, and Achsah and Othniel were brothers' children, or first cousins, between whom marriage was allowed of: <p>and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife; according to the tenor of his proclamation, and the promise he made. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Othniel the son of Kenaz</span>] The younger brother of Caleb (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm" title="And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.">Jdg 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Jdg 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-13.htm" title="And the sons of Kenaz; Othniel, and Seraiah: and the sons of Othniel; Hathath.">1 Chronicles 4:13</a>). But it is not certain from these passages whether Kenaz was his father, or, as some think, the more remote ancestor and head of the tribe, whose descendants were called “sons of Kenaz” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-12.htm" title="Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.">Numbers 32:12</a>). If Jephunneh was the father of Caleb, he was probably the father of Othniel also. The next mention of him is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Jdg 3:9</a>, where we find him the first Judge of Israel after the death of Joshua (for his genealogy see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/4-13.htm" title="And the sons of Kenaz; Othniel, and Seraiah: and the sons of Othniel; Hathath....">1 Chronicles 4:13-14</a>), delivering the Israelites from the tyranny of the Mesopotamian king, Chushanrishathaim.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the brother of Caleb</span>] There is a doubt here whether Othniel was “filius Kenasi, frat<span class="ital">er</span> Calebi,” or “filius Kenasi frat<span class="ital">ris</span> Calebi.” For the second explanation comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-3.htm" title="But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.">2 Samuel 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-32.htm" title="And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.">2 Samuel 13:32</a>, “Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother; for the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-6.htm" title="Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?

But the fact (see note on Joshua 14:6) that Caleb was the son of Jephunneh leads to the idea that the latter is meant. Othniel was a valiant and capable commander, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thence "the border went out towards the north-west to the shoulder of Ekron (Akir: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>), then bent to Shichron, passed over to Mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel." Shichron is possibly Sugheir, an hour to the south-west of Jebna (Knobel). But if this is correct, the mountain of Baalah cannot be the short range of hills to the west of Akir which runs almost parallel with the coast Rob. Pal. iii. p. 21), as Knobel supposes; but must be a mountain on the south side of the Wady Surar, since the boundary had already crossed this wady between Ekron and Shichron. Jabneel is the Philistine town of Jabneh, the walls of which were demolished by Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), a place frequently mentioned in the books of Maccabees as well as by Josephus under the name of Jamnia. It still exists as a good-sized village, under the name of Jebnah, upon a small eminence on the western side of Nahr Rubin, four hours to the south of Joppa, and an hour and a half from the sea (Rob. Pal. iii. p. 22). From Jabneh the boundary went out to the (Mediterranean) Sea, probably along the course of the great valley, i.e., the Nahr Rubin, as Robinson supposes (Pal. ii. p. 343). The western boundary was the Great Sea, i.e., the Mediterranean. </body></html>
