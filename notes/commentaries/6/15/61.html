It abounds in limestone rocks, perforated by numerous caverns, and often of fantastic shapes. It is badly supplied with water, and hence, is for the most part barren, though affording in many parts, now quite desolate, clear tokens of former cultivation.

Cities in the Wilderness<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This section relates to the cities in “the Wilderness” between the Mountain and the Dead Sea, and includes one Group of <span class="ital">six cities</span>:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="ital">Beth-arabah</span>, see above, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-6.htm" title="And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:">Joshua 15:6</a>; Joshua 2</span>. <span class="ital">Middin</span>; 3. <span class="ital">Secacah</span>; 4. <span class="ital">Nibshan</span>, sites unknown, places not mentioned elsewhere; 5. <span class="ital">The city of Salt</span>, “<span class="ital">Civitas Salis</span>,” Vulgate, probably near the Valley of Salt, at the southern end of the Dead Sea, where the Edomites suffered several defeats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-13.htm" title="And David got him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.">2 Samuel 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2 Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm" title="Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>); 6. <span class="ital">En-gedi</span>, “the spring of the wild goat” or “gazelle,” from the numerous ibexes or Syrian chamois which inhabit these cliffs, now <span class="ital">Ain Jidy</span>. “Here,” remarks Canon Tristram, “a copious warm fresh spring bursts forth amidst an oasis of tropical vegetation. Here that quaint asclepiad the osher, the jujube, the beautiful parasite <span class="ital">Lonicera indica</span>, and a host of strange semi-tropical plants send our botanist into an ecstacy of delight.” <span class="ital">Land of Moab</span>, p. 27. “Relics of its grove of palms (whence its name Hazazon Tamar = “the felling of palm-trees”) “are still to be seen, in the trunks of palms washed up on the shores of the Dead Sea, preserved by the salt with which a long submersion in those strange waters has impregnated them.” Stanley’s <span class="ital">S. and P</span>., p. 144. Here (<span class="ital">a</span>) the settlements of the Amorites were attacked by the army of Chedorlaomer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm" title="And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelled in Hazezontamar.">Genesis 14:7</a>), immediately before its descent into the plain, and final victory over the five kings; here (<span class="ital">b</span>) the Kenites had their “nest” in the cliff (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm" title="And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling place, and you put your nest in a rock.">Numbers 24:21</a>); here (<span class="ital">c</span>) David took refuge from the pursuit of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.">1 Samuel 24:1</a>); here (<span class="ital">d</span>) the solitary sect of the Essenes had their chief seat.” See Stanley, <span class="ital">S. and P</span>., pp. 295, 296.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">In the wilderness</span>] The wilderness of Judæa. “A true wilderness it is, but no desert, with the sides of the limestone ranges clad with no shrubs larger than a sage or a thyme—brown and bare on all the southern and western faces, where the late rains had not yet restored the life burnt out by the summer’s sun, but with a slight carpeting of tender green already springing up on their northern sides. Not a human habitation, not a sign of life, meets the eye for twenty miles; and yet there seems no reason why, for pasturage at least, the country might not be largely available. But there are no traces of the terraces which furrow the hills of the rest of Palestine; and one small herd of long-eared black goats were all we saw till we reached the plains of Jericho.” Tristram’s <span class="ital">Land of Israel</span>, p. 197.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 61.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>; This was the eastern part of the territory of Judah, bordering on the Dead Sea. Here David took refuge from the pursuit of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>), here St. John the Baptist prepared the way of Christ. It is described by Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 197) as "a wilderness, but no desert." Herbage is to be found there, but no trees, no signs of the cultivation formerly bestowed upon the hill country (see above, ver. 48). And the fewness of the cities in early times is a proof that its character has not been altered by time. The hills, says Canon Tristram, are of a "peculiar desolate tameness," and are intersected by the traces of winter watercourses, seaming the sides of the monotonous round-topped hills. Other writers describe this country in less favourable terms, denying it even the scanty herbage found there by Canon Tristram. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The third group of ten towns, to the east of both the former groups, towards the desert.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a><p>Maon, the home of Nabal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>), on the border of the desert of Judah, which is here called the desert of Maon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-25.htm">1 Samuel 23:25</a>), has been preserved in Tell Man, on a conical mountain commanding an extensive prospect, east by north of Semua, three hours and three-quarters to the S.S.E. of Hebron (Rob. ii. p. 193). Carmel, a town and mountain mentioned in the history of David, and again in the time of Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-12.htm">1 Samuel 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>). In the time of the Romans it was a large place, with a Roman garrison (Onom.), and is the present Kurmul, on the north-west of Maon, where there are considerable ruins of a very ancient date (Rob. ii. pp. 196ff.).

Juttah, which was assigned to the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>), and was a vicus praegrandis Judaeorum in the time of the fathers (Onom. s. v. Jethan), was eighteen Roman miles to the south (south-east) of Eleutheropolis, and is the present Jutta or Jitta, a large Mahometan place with ruins, an hour and three-quarters to the south of Hebron (Seetzen, iii. p. 8; Rob. ii. p. 191, 628).</body></html>
