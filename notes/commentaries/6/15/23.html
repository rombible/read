But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>List of the towns of the tribe of Judah.

One gets the best idea of the relative situation of these cities by looking at the map.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Kedesh,....

Othniel, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a> the first judge of the Israelites after Joshua's death, is called &#1499;&#1500;&#1489; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497; &#1511;&#1504;&#1494; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, i.e., either "the son of Kenaz (and) brother of Caleb," or "the son of Kenaz the brother of Caleb." The second rendering is quite admissible (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-32.htm">2 Samuel 13:32</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>), but the former is the more usual; and for this the Masorites have decided, since they have separated achi Caleb from ben-Kenaz by a tiphchah. And this is the correct one, as "the son of Kenaz" is equivalent to "the Kenizzite" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>). According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>, Othniel was Caleb's younger brother. Caleb gave him his daughter for a wife, as marriage with a brother's daughter was not forbidden in the law (see my Bibl. Archol. ii. 107, note 14).</body></html>
