But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"The valley" or the Shephelah, is bounded on the south by the Negeb, on the west by the Mediterranean, on the north by the plain of Sharon, on the east by "the mountains" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>. It is a well-defined district, of an undulating surface and highly fertile character, thickly dotted, even at the present time, with villages, which are for the most part situated on the different hills. The towns in this district, like those in the Negeb, are classed in four groups.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33-36</a><p>First group of fourteen towns: these belong to the northeastern portion of the Shephelah. Eshtaol and Zoreah were afterward assigned to the tribe of Dan, and inhabited by Danites <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-8.htm">Judges 18:8</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11</a>. The latter place was the home of Samson <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2</a>. It was one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>, and was re-occupied by the Jews after the captivity <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>. It is probably the modern Surah. (Eshtaol has been identified with Eshua (Conder)). Both places were in later times partly populated by Judahites from Kirjath-jearim; perhaps after the departure of the colony of Danites for Dan-Laish. Zanoah is the present "Zanna", not far from Surah. Socoh is the modern "Shuweikah". Sharaim is perhaps to be sought in the modern "Zakariya". Gederah ("wall" or "fortress") was a name borne with various terminations by several places.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 15:21-63.

The first of these, Jerom says (i), is in the borders of Eleutheropolis, as you go to Aelia (or Jerusalem); there is at this day a village called Zanua: <p>and Engannim, which signifies a fountain of gardens, is now (according to the same writer (k)) a village near Bethel: <p>and Tappuah was a royal city, of which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-17.htm">Joshua 12:17</a>. Enaim, in the tribe of Judah, Jerom says (l) in his day was the village Bethenim, about the turpentine tree, or oak of Mamre; but that seems to be the same with Ain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a>; of which he says the same under that word, and makes it to be two miles from the oak, and four from Hebron. Masius thinks it is the same with Enam, near to Timnath, of which See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>; it following Tappuah one would be tempted to think with Jarchi it was the same with Entappuah, but that that was on the borders of Manasseh, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>, <p>and Enam; it has an prefixed to it, and may be read "that Enam", as pointing out some known and remarkable place, though now unknown. <p>(i) De loc.
