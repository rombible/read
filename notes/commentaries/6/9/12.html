Thus the discovery of the glory and the grace of God in the gospel, is to some a savour of life unto life, but to others a savour of death unto death, 2Co 2:16. The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. The falsehood of the Gibeonites cannot be justified. We must not do evil that good may themselves to the God of Israel, we have reason to think Joshua would have been directed by the oracle of God to spare their lives. But when they had once said, We are come from a far country, they were led to say it made of skins, and their clothes: one lie brings on another, and that a third, and so on. The way of that sin is especially down-hill. Yet their faith and prudence are to be commended. In submitting to Israel they submitted to the God of Israel, which implied forsaking their idolatries. And how can we do better than cast ourselves upon the mercy of a God of all goodness? The way to avoid judgment is to meet it by repentance. Let us do like these Gibeonites, seek peace with God in the rags of abasement, and godly sorrow; so our sin shall not be our ruin. Let us be servants to Jesus, our blessed Joshua, and we shall live.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal references. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

But the Israelites hesitated, and said to the Hivites, i.e., the Gibeonites who were Hivites, that they might perhaps be living in the midst of them (the Israelites), i.e., in the land of Canaan, which the Israelites already looked upon as their own; and if so, how could they make a league with them? This hesitation on their part was founded upon the express command of God, that they were not to make any league with the tribes of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>, etc.). In reply to this the Gibeonites simply said, "We are thy servants" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-8.htm">Joshua 9:8</a>), i.e., we are at thy service, which, according to the obsequious language common in the East, was nothing more than a phrase intended to secure the favour of Joshua, and by no means implied a readiness on their part to submit to the Israelites and pay them tribute, as Rosenmller, Knobel, and others suppose; for, as Grotius correctly observes, what they wished for was "a friendly alliance, by which both their territory and also full liberty would be secured to themselves." The Keri &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>) is nothing more than a critical conjecture, occasioned not so much by the singular &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which is frequently construed in the historical writings as a collective noun with a plural verb, as by the singular suffix attached to &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, which is to be explained on the ground that only one of the Israelites (viz., Joshua) was speaking as the mouthpiece of all the rest. The plural &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is used, because Joshua spoke in the name of the people. </body></html>
