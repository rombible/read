Thus the discovery of the glory and the grace of God in the gospel, is to some a savour of life unto life, but to others a savour of death unto death, 2Co 2:16. The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. The falsehood of the Gibeonites cannot be justified. We must not do evil that good may themselves to the God of Israel, we have reason to think Joshua would have been directed by the oracle of God to spare their lives. But when they had once said, We are come from a far country, they were led to say it made of skins, and their clothes: one lie brings on another, and that a third, and so on. The way of that sin is especially down-hill. Yet their faith and prudence are to be commended. In submitting to Israel they submitted to the God of Israel, which implied forsaking their idolatries. And how can we do better than cast ourselves upon the mercy of a God of all goodness? The way to avoid judgment is to meet it by repentance. Let us do like these Gibeonites, seek peace with God in the rags of abasement, and godly sorrow; so our sin shall not be our ruin. Let us be servants to Jesus, our blessed Joshua, and we shall live.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal references. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>. Edrei only is mentioned. This is not the Ashtaroth-Karnaim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>, which is so called from the worship of the horned Astarte, or crescent (see below), to distinguish it from this Ashtaroth. The two cities were close together. Eusebius and Jerome state that they were only nine miles apart. The site of this city has been identified with Tel Ashtereh, in a wide plain on the east of Jordan. It appears as Astaratu in the Karnak list of cities captured by Thothines III. The name has been identified with the Assyrian <span class="accented">Ishtar</span>, the Persian, Greek, and Latin <span class="accented">aster</span> and our star. So Gesenius, 'Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> Whence Lucian seems to have been wrong in his idea that the worship of Astarte, like that of Artemis at Ephesus, was that of the moon. But Rawlinson, in his 'Ancient Monarchies,' decides against this identification. The last mention of this city in Jewish history is in the bold and successful expedition of Judas Maccabaeus into Gilead, in which he penetrated as far as this city (called Kar-naim), and brought the Jews residing there and in the neighbourhood to Jerusalem (1 Macc. 6.). Kuenen, in his 'History of the Religion of Israel,' makes a distinction between the worship of Ashtaroth and of Asherah. The former he regards as the worship of the moon, and a pure worship; the latter of Venus, and an impure one. But though Asherah and Ashtaroth, or Ashtoreth, are undoubtedly distinct, yet both worships may have been impure, as the worship of Artemis of the Ephesians (the <span class="accented">Diana Multimamma</span>, or the image of fecundity) unquestionably was. "It is probable," says Mr. G. Smith, "that the first intention in the mythology was only to represent love as heaven born, but in time a more sensual view prevailed, and the worship of Ishtar became one of the darkest features in Babylonian mythology." The Babylonian Mylitta, or Venus, was worshipped under a crescent form, as Babylonian sculptures prove. A Syrian altar with the crescent on it is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge. It has a female figure on one side, with the crescent, and a male figure - of Baal, no doubt - on the other. Another is mentioned in a late able article in the <span class="accented">Times</span>, as having been found in Carehemish, the Hittite capital. The Chaldaean astronomers had, no doubt, discovered the use of telescopes (though in the translucent sky of Chaldaea perhaps the crescent Venus might be seen without them), for we find Saturn represented on their monuments with a ring (see Proctor, 'Saturn and his System,' p. 197). Consequently the worship of the crescent Venus involves no anachronism. Asherah, often wrongly translated "grove" in our version (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a>), is probably the goddess Fortune, derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span>, happiness. Ashtaroth is spelt not with Aleph, but with Ain. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the inhabitants of a republic, which included not only Gibeon the capital, but the towns of Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim also, acted differently from the rest. Gibeon (&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, Gabaon, lxx Vulg.) was larger than Ai, being one of the royal cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>), and was inhabited by Hivites, who were a brave people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>). It was afterwards allotted to the tribe of Benjamin, and set apart as a Levitical town (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-17.htm">Joshua 21:17</a>). After the destruction of Nob by Saul, the tabernacle was removed thither, and there it remained till the building of Solomon's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-29.htm">1 Chronicles 21:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>.). According to Josephus, it was forty or fifty stadia from Jerusalem, and judging from its name was built upon a hill. It is to be found in the modern Jib, two good hours' journey to the north-west of Jerusalem, a village of moderate size, on a long chalk hill which overlooks a very fertile, well cultivated plain, or rather a basin, consisting of broad valleys and plains, and rises like a vineyard, in the form of separate terraces (Strauss, Sinai, p. 332). The remains of large massive buildings of great antiquity are still to be seen there, also some fountains, and two large subterraneous reservoirs (vid., Rob. Pal. ii. p. 136). When the Gibeonites heard of the fate of Jericho and Ai, they also did (something) with stratagem. In the expression &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; ("they also") there is a reference implied to what Joshua had done at Jericho and Ai; not, however, to the stratagem resorted to in the case of Ai, as such an allusion would not apply to Jericho. They set out as ambassadors: &#1497;&#1510;&#1496;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, which occurs in every other instance in the form of a noun, signifying a messenger (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>, etc.). In the Hithpael it means to make themselves ambassadors, to travel as ambassadors. The translators of the ancient versions, however, adopted the reading &#1497;&#1510;&#1496;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, they provided themselves with food; but this was nothing more than a conjecture founded upon <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-12.htm">Joshua 9:12</a>, and without the slightest critical value. They also took "old sacks upon their asses, and old mended wineskins." &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, lit. bound together, is very characteristic. There are two modes adopted in the East of repairing skins when torn, viz., inserting a patch, or tying up the piece that is torn in the form of a bag. Here the reference is to the latter, which was most in harmony with their statement, that the skins had got injured upon their long journey. Also "old mended sandals upon their feet, and old clothes upon them (upon their bodies); and all the bread of their provisions had become dry and quite mouldy." &#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, lit. furnished with points; &#1504;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;, pointed, speckled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a>.). Hence the rendering of the lxx, &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;; Theod., &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;; Luther, schimmlicht, mouldy; whereas the rendering adopted by Aquila is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; by Symmachus, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, i.e., adustus, torridus; and by the Vulgate, in frusta comminuti, i.e., crumbled. </body></html>
