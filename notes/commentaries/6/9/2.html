"As it is written in the book of the law of Moses:" viz., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a> (25). On the presentation of burnt-offerings and slain-offerings, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-6.htm">Deuteronomy 27:6-7</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-32.htm">Joshua 8:32</a> nothing is mentioned but the writing of the law upon the stones; all the rest is presupposed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-2.htm">Deuteronomy 27:2</a>., to which the expression "the stones" refers. "Copy of the law:" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18</a>; see the explanation at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-3.htm">Deuteronomy 27:3</a>. In connection with the third part of the ceremony the promulgation of the law with the blessing and cursing, the account of the Mosaic instructions given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11</a>. is completed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a> by the statement that "all Israel, and their elders (i.e., with their elders), and shoterim, and judges," stood on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests, the stranger as well as the native, i.e., without any exception, one half (i.e., six tribes) towards Mount Ebal, and the other half towards Mount Gerizim. For further remarks, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11</a>. "As Moses commanded to bless the people before:" i.e., as he had previously commanded. The fact that the thought itself does not suit the context is quite sufficient to show that the explanation given by many commentators, viz., that they were to commence with the blessings, is incorrect. But if, on the other hand, we connect the word "before" with the principal verb of the sentence, "commanded," the meaning will be that Moses did not give the command to proclaim the blessings and cursings to the people for the first time in connection with these instructions (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>), but had done so before, at the very outset, namely, as early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a>.</body></html>
