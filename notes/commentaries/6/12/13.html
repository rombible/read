A list is given of the kings subdued by Israel: thirty-one in all. This shows how fruitful Canaan then was, in which so many chose to throng together. This was the land God appointed for Israel; yet in our day it is one of the most barren and unprofitable countries in the world. Such is the effect of the curse it lies under, since its possessors rejected Christ and his gospel, as was foretold by Moses, De 29:23. The vengeance of a righteous God, inflicted on all these kings and their subjects, for their wickedness, should make us dread and hate sin. The fruitful land bestowed on his chosen people, should fill our hearts with hope and confidence in his mercy, and with humble gratitude.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The identification of several of these places is still uncertain: the same name (e. g. Aphek, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-18.htm">Joshua 12:18</a>) being applied to various places in various parts of Palestine. Geder, or Gedor <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>, a city in the mountain district in the south of the territory of Judah, is no doubt the modern "Jedur".<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 12:7-24.

A list of thirty-one chief towns is here given; and, as the whole land contained a superficial extent of only fifteen miles in length by fifty in breadth, it is evident that these capital cities belonged to petty and insignificant kingdoms. With a few exceptions, they were not the scenes of any important events recorded in the sacred history, and therefore do not require a particular notice.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The king of Debir, one,....

If so, it is the Gedor of the Onomasticon, ten miles from Beit-Jibrin, or Eleutheropolis, now Jedireh. Conder, however, with whom Vandevelde seems to agree, places Geder in the mountain region, and identifies it with Gedor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>) and the modern Jedur, in the Hebron mountain. So Keil and Delitzsch, Robinson, and others. The Gedor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-39.htm">1 Chronicles 4:39</a> may be the same place. It is described as on the east side of the "gai," or ravine, but no clearer indication of the place is given. It is, however, unlikely that the Simeonites would have found the children of tiara undisturbed in the mountains of Hebron in the reign of Hezekiah (see vers. 40, 41). The LXX. reads Gerar, and this is very probably the true reading. There was a "Nahal," or winter torrent, there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-17.htm">Genesis 26:17, 19</a>), and therefore possibly a "gal." The whole passage in 1 Chronicles should be consulted. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>List of the thirty-one kings of Canaan whom Joshua smote on the western side of the Jordan, "from Baal-gad, in the valley of Lebanon, to the bald mountain that goeth up towards Seir" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>).
