Moses gave to one part of Israel a very rich and fruitful country, but it was on the outside of Jordan. Joshua gave to all Israel the holy land, within Jordan. So the law has given to some few of God's spiritual Israel worldly blessings, earnests of good things to come; but our Lord Jesus, the true Joshua, provided for all the children of promise spiritual blessings, and the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the middle of the river - i. e. as appears from <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>, "from the city that is in the midst of the river;" namely,, Ar Moab (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Jos 12:1-6.

No town submitted peaceably to the Israelites, with the exception of Gibeon: they took the whole in war. "For it was of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-20.htm">Joshua 11:20</a>), i.e., God ordered it so that they (the Canaanites) hardened their heart to make war upon Israel, that they might fall under the ban, and be destroyed without mercy. On the hardening of the heart as a work of God, see the remarks upon the hardening of Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>). It cannot be inferred from this, that if the Canaanites had received the Israelites amicably, God would have withdrawn His command to destroy them, and allowed the Israelites to make peace with them; for when they made peace with the Gibeonites, they did not inquire what as the will of the Lord, but acted in opposition to it (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>). The remark is made with special reference to this, and has been correctly explained by Augustine (qu. 8 in Jos.) as follows: "Because the Israelites had shown mercy to some of them of their own accord, though in opposition to the command of God, therefore it is stated that they (the Canaanites) made war upon them so that none of them were spared, and the Israelites were not induced to show mercy to the neglect of the commandment of God." </body></html>
