He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses refer to the northern portion of the territory of Asher, on the Phoenician frontier.

Its soil well fulfilled the prophetic descriptions of Jacob and Moses. Here Asher could “dip his foot” in the <span class="ital">oil</span> of his luxuriant olive-groves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-24.htm" title="And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.">Deuteronomy 33:24</a>) such as still distinguish this region, and fatten on the <span class="ital">bread</span>, the fruit of the rich plain of Phœnicia and his fertile upland valleys (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm" title="Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.">Genesis 49:20</a>). Here he could “yield royal dainties” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm" title="Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.">Genesis 49:20</a>), “oil and wine from his olives and vineyards, and milk and butter from his pastures;” while <span class="ital">under his shoes</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-25.htm" title="Your shoes shall be iron and brass; and as your days, so shall your strength be.">Deuteronomy 33:25</a>) was the <span class="ital">iron ore</span> of the southern slopes of Lebanon, and the <span class="ital">brass</span> or copper of the neighbouring Phœnician territory. See Stanley’s <span class="ital">S. and P</span>., p. 362; Pusey’s <span class="ital">Lectures on the Book of Daniel</span>, p. 294; Porter’s <span class="ital">Handbook of Sinai and Palestine</span>, ii. p. 363. But to the richness of his soil and the proximity of the Phœnician towns the degeneracy and subsequent obscurity of Asher may be mainly traced. At the numbering of Israel at Sinai, the tribe was more numerous than either Ephraim, Manasseh, or Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/1-32.htm" title="Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;...">Numbers 1:32-41</a>), “but in the reign of David, so insignificant had it become, that its name is altogether omitted from the list of the chief rulers” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/27-16.htm" title="Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah:...">1 Chronicles 27:16-22</a>). “The Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-32.htm" title="But the Asherites dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.">Jdg 1:32</a>), and “though not nominally, or even really, a subject people, they were so thoroughly checked in their plans of conquest, and dashed their strength so uselessly against the strong rock of Phœnician power, that in the shock of failure they settled down as a people admitted to be strong, and allowed to exist side by side with the Phœnicians, under certain statutes and arrangements mutually entered into.” Ritter’s <span class="ital">Compar. Geo. of Palestine</span>, iii. 187, 188. With the exception of the aged widow, “Anna, the daughter of Phanuel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>), no name “shines out of the general obscurity” of the tribe. “The contemptuous allusion in the Song of Deborah sums up this whole history, when in the great gathering of the tribes against Sisera, <span class="ital">Asher continued on the sea-shore and abode in his creeks</span>,” So insignificant was the tribe to which was assigned the fortress which Napoleon called the key of Palestine.

The natural advantages of the territory must have been great. Not only was it described prophetically by Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>) and by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24, 25</a>), but the prosperity of the two great maritime cities of Tyro and Sidon was due to the immense commercial advantages the neighbourhood afforded. St. Jean d'Acre, within the territory once assigned to Asher, has inherited the prosperity, so far as anything under the Turkish rule can be prosperous, once enjoyed by her two predecessors. Maundrell, the acute English chaplain at Aleppo, who visited Palestine in 1696, describes the plain of Acre in his day as about six hours' journey from north to south, and two from west to east; as being well watered, and possessing "everything else that might render it both pleasant and fruitful. But," he adds, "this delicious plain is now almost desolate, being suffered, for want of culture, to run up to rank weeds, as high as our horses' backs." Asher, however, never employed the advantages its situation offered. They never subdued the Canaanites around them, but, unquestionably at a very early date (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>) preferred a life of compromise and ignoble ease to the national welfare. But it would be incorrect to suppose that because the tribe is omitted in the list of rulers given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27.htm">1 Chronicles 27</a>, it had ceased to be a power in Israel. For Gad is also omitted in that list, while among the warriors who came to greet David when he became undisputed king of Israel, Asher sent 40,000 trained warriors, a number exceeding the men of Ephraim, and those of Simeon, of Dan, and of the half tribe of Manasseh (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a>.), and far exceeding the numbers of Benjamin, which had never recovered the war of almost extermination waged against it, in consequence of the atrocity at Gibeah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>.). Possibly the reason why so few are mentioned of the tribe of Judah on that occasion is because so many were already with David. There seems no ground for the idea of Dean Stanley, that the allusion to Asher in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a> is any more contemptuous than the allusion to any other tribe. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The territory of the Asherites was as follows. Helkath, which was given up to the Levites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-31.htm">Joshua 21:31</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75</a>, where Hukok is an old copyist's error), is the present Jelka, three hours to the east of Acco (Akka: Scholz, Reise, p. 257), or Jerka, a Druse village situated upon an eminence, and judging from the remains, an ancient place (Van de Velde, R. i. p. 214; Rob. iii. App.). Hali, according to Knobel possibly Julis, between Jerka and Akka, in which case the present name arose from the form Halit, and t was changed into s. Beten, according to the Onom. (s. v. &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;%: Bathne) as vicus Bethbeten, eight Roman miles to the east of Ptolemais, has not yet been found. Achshaph is also unknown (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>). The Onom. (s. v. Achsaph) says nothing more about its situation than that it was in tribu Aser, whilst the statement made s. v. Acsaph (&#x391;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;), that it was villula Chasalus (&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x395;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;), eight Roman miles from Diocaesarea ad radicem montis Thabor, leads into the territory of Zebulun.</body></html>
