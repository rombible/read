On the east of Asher lies the tribe of Naphtali, but most of the towns named in these verses lie well within the territory of Asher. The northern end of the territory of this tribe lies beyond the limits of the Ordnance Survey, for it reaches “unto great Zidon” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-28.htm" title="And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Zidon;">Joshua 19:28</a>). The southern boundary is said to be Carmel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-26.htm" title="And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reaches to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;">Joshua 19:26</a>), but no <span class= "ital">town </span>is identified south of Cabul (<span class= "ital">Kabûl, </span>south-east of <span class= "ital">Akkah, </span>sheet 5).<p>The towns identified are as follows:—<p>(25) <span class= "ital">El B’aneh, EL-Yasif </span>or <span class= "ital">Kefr Yasif </span>(sheet 3).<p>(26) <span class= "ital">Khurbet-el-Amûd, </span>and <span class= "ital">M’aîsleh </span>(? <span class= "ital">Kh.-Muslih</span>) (sheet 3).<p><span class= "bld">Shihor-libnath</span> (river of glass), the river Belus (sheet 5).<p>(27) <span class= "bld">Beth-dagon</span> (<span class= "ital">Tell-’ Daûk</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>near the mouth of the Belus.<p><span class= "bld">Neiel</span><span class= "ital">.—</span>(<span class= "ital">Y’Arûn, </span>sheet 5).<p><span class= "bld">Cabul.</span>—(<span class= "ital">Kabûl, </span>south-east of <span class= "ital">Akkah, </span>sheet 5).<p>(28) <span class= "bld">Hebron.</span>—(<span class= "ital">Abdon, Kh.-Abdeh, </span>sheet 3).

He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Helkath, a Levitical town <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-31.htm">Joshua 21:31</a>, is probably Yerka, a village about seven or eight miles north-west of Acre, in a Wady of the same name. Alammelech was in the "Wady Melik," which joins the Kishon from the northeast, not far from the sea.<p>Shihor-libnath - i. e. "black-white." The two words are now generally admitted to be the name of a river, probably the modern "Nahr Zerka," or Blue River, which reaches the sea about 8 miles south of Dor, and whose name has a correspondence both to black and white. Possibly we have in the occurrence of the term Shihor here a trace of the contact, which was close and continuous in ancient times, between Phoenicia and Egypt <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>. Cabul <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a> still retains its ancient name; it lies between four and five miles west of Jotapata and about ten miles southeast of Acre. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 19:24-31.

Sion, according to the Onom. villa juxta montem Thabor, has not yet been discovered. Anaharath is supposed by Knobel to be Na'urah, on the eastern side of the Little Hermon (Bibl. Res. p. 337); but he regards the text as corrupt, and following the Cod. Al. of the lxx, which has &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8; and &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;, maintains that the reading should be Archanath, to which Arneh on the north of Jenin in the plain corresponds (Seetzen, ii. p. 156; Rob. iii. p. 157). But the circumstance that the Cod. Al. has two names instead of one makes its reading very suspicious.</body></html>
