The boundary passed westward until it touched the Kishon, near "Tell Kaimon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-22.htm">Joshua 12:22</a> note), and thence, turned northward, leaving Carmel, which belonged to Asher, on its west. The territory of Zebulun accordingly would not anywhere reach to the Mediterranean, though its eastern side abutted on the sea of Galilee, and gave the tribe those "outgoings" attributed to it in the Blessing of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18</a>).

Knobel, however, says that if the Kishon had been meant it would have been called by its name, and that we must therefore understand the Wady-el-Mil'h.
