(a) Historically. Joshua waited for his own inheritance until the last. He sought not his own interest, but that of the people. He asked no kingdom for himself or his family, only a city, which he built, and dwelt therein. (6) Typically. “They gave him the city which he asked, according to the word of the Lord.” What does this mean in the case of the true Joshua? <span class= "ital">“Ask of me, </span>and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.” He must reign till God hath put <span class= "ital">all enemies under His feet. </span>Then, and not till then, will He take His own personal inheritance, and be subject to Him that put all things under Him. Timnath-serah means an abundant portion, a portion of abundance. Though small, it was <span class= "ital">enough </span>for Joshua. It will be enough for his Antitype, when “He shall see of the travail of His soul, and <span class= "ital">be satisfied.” </span>It is afterwards called Timnath-heres, the portion <span class= "ital">of the Sun. </span>“His going forth is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-49.htm" title="When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:">Joshua 19:49</a></span>. <span class="ital">When they had made an end of dividing the land — </span>That is, after every tribe had had their respective portion assigned to them. <span class="ital">The children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua — </span>We cannot but admire the wonderful modesty of this great man, who received his portion last of all, and then, not by lot, but by their gift, who were already possessed of the whole land.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:17-51 Joshua waited till all the tribes were settled, before he asked any provision for himself. He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words "too little" are an insertion of the King James Version Render rather, "the border of the children of Dan was extended." The Hebrew appears to mean "the children of Dan enlarged their border because they had not room enough."<p>The reason of this was that the Danites, a numerous tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5</a> note), found themselves <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34-35</a> cooped up among the hills by the powerful and warlike Amorites. Hence, the Danite expedition (see the marginal reference), which surprised the Sidonion inhabitants of Leshem, an unwarlike and peaceable race, exterminated them, and annexed their city and territory to the portion of Dan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 19:49-51.

It was only when his work was done, and Israel had received her allotted territory, that Joshua thought it right to take his own inheritance.
