Something similar seems to have occurred in several districts of the country. The Israelites not taking advantage of the impression produced by Joshua’s great victories to occupy the territory assigned to them, the nations of Canaan re-possessed themselves of their former abodes. and held them against Israel. The Philistines are expressly said to have been left to prove Israel. Joshua was not permitted to exterminate them. And although Dan and Judah, numerically the two strongest of all the tribes (both in the census in the plains of Moab and at Sinai), were placed next to the Philistines, and had the task of conquering that nation assigned to them, still it was not effected. We read in Judges 1, <span class= "ital">“</span>The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not suffer them to come down into the valley.”<p>Hence the Danites, instead of attacking the Philistines and Amorites in their inheritance, preferred to form a new settlement in the north, and put to the sword “a people quiet and secure,” who “had no deliverer,” rather than “run with patience the race set before them.” They were not minded to resist unto blood, striving against their foes. (See the narrative in Judges 18, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/19-27.htm" title="And turns toward the sun rise to Bethdagon, and reaches to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand,">Joshua 19:27-28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a></span>. <span class="ital">The coast of Dan went out too little </span>— The words <span class="ital">too little </span>are not in the Hebrew, where there is nothing that corresponds with them. The passage runs thus: <span class="ital">The coast of the children of Dan went out from them; </span>that is, they were dispossessed of it in some parts, or kept out of them by the former inhabitants; and we find, by <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm" title="And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:">Jdg 1:34</a>, that the Amorites forced them into the mountains, and would not suffer them to dwell in the valley. This reduced them to such straits, that they were constrained to enlarge their border some other way; which they did as follows. They <span class="ital">went up to fight against Leshem — </span>A city not far from Jordan, called Laish in the book of Judges, before it was taken by the Danites. <span class="ital">And called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father — </span>It was customary for conquerors to change the names of those places they subdued. This was done with respect to Leshem, after the death of Joshua; and is related more largely in the book of Judges, chap. 18., where the whole expedition is recorded. From whence some have argued that this book was not written by Joshua; whereas no more can fairly be inferred, than that, in after times, Ezra, or some other, thought good to insert this verse here, in order to complete the account of the Danites’ possessions.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:17-51 Joshua waited till all the tribes were settled, before he asked any provision for himself. He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words "too little" are an insertion of the King James Version Render rather, "the border of the children of Dan was extended." The Hebrew appears to mean "the children of Dan enlarged their border because they had not room enough."<p>The reason of this was that the Danites, a numerous tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5</a> note), found themselves <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34-35</a> cooped up among the hills by the powerful and warlike Amorites. Hence, the Danite expedition (see the marginal reference), which surprised the Sidonion inhabitants of Leshem, an unwarlike and peaceable race, exterminated them, and annexed their city and territory to the portion of Dan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47. the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem&#8212;The Danites, finding their inheritance too small, decided to enlarge its boundaries by the sword; and, having conquered Leshem (Laish), they planted a colony there, calling the new settlement by the name of Dan (see on [200]Jud 18:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Went out too little for them, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">went out from them</span>, to wit, out of their hands or possession; for so this Hebrew word is used concerning those lands, which in the year of the jubilee are said to <span class="ital">go out</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-28.htm" title="But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.">Leviticus 25:28</a>,30,31,33</span>, i.e. out of the hands of the present possessor, to the first and ancient owner.

It was, according to Jerom (c), situated near Paneas, out of which the river Jordan flowed; and Kimchi on the text observes, their Rabbins (d) say, that Leshem is Pamias (i.e. Paneas), and that Jordan flows from the cave of Pamias, and had its name  because it descended from Dan; and so Josephus (e) says, that Panium is a cave under a mountain, from whence rise the springs of Jordan, and is the fountain of it; and Pliny also says (f), the river Jordan rises out of the fountain Paneas. This city was enlarged and beautified by Philip Herod, and he called it by the name of Caesarea Philippi, both in honour of Tiberius Caesar (g) and after his own name, by which name it goes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>; and is called in the Jerusalem Targum on <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>, Dan of Caesarea. <p>(c) De loc.
