If a true believer has obtained an unintended and improper advantage in any thing, he will give it up without murmuring. Love seeketh not her own, and doth not behave unseemly; it will induce those in whom it richly dwells, to part with their own to supply what is lacking to their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thirteen - Fourteen names have been given.

The Lot of Simeon.<p>1. the second lot came forth to Simeon&#8212;The next lot that was drawn at Shiloh, gave the tribe of Simeon his inheritance within the territory, which had been assigned to that of Judah. The knowledge of Canaan possessed by the Israelites, when the division of the land commenced, was but very general, being derived from the rapid sweep they had made over it during the course of conquest; and it was on the ground of that rough survey alone that the distribution proceeded, by which Judah received an inheritance. Time showed that this territory was too large (Jos 19:9), either for their numbers, however great, to occupy and their arms to defend, or too large in proportion to the allotments of the other tribes. Justice therefore required (what kind and brotherly feeling readily dictated) a modification of their possession; and a part of it was appropriated to Simeon. By thus establishing it within the original domain of another tribe, the prophecy of Jacob in regard to Simeon was fulfilled (Ge 49:7); for from its boundaries being not traced, there is reason to conclude that its people were divided and dispersed among those of Judah; and though one group of its cities named (Jos 19:2-6), gives the idea of a compact district, as it is usually represented by map makers, the other group (Jos 19:7, 8) were situated, two in the south, and two elsewhere, with tracts of the country around them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thirteen cities, </span> or, <span class="ital">towns</span>, as some of them are called. <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-32.htm" title="And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Ashan, five cities:">1 Chronicles 4:32</a></span>.

Gibeath or Gibeah, i.e., Gibeah of Benjamin, which was destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in the time of the judges, on account of the flagrant crime which had been committed there (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-20</a>), is also called Gibeah of Saul, as being the home and capital of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-4.htm">1 Samuel 11:4</a>, etc.), and was situated, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-13.htm">Judges 19:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-29.htm">Isaiah 10:29</a>, between Jerusalem and Ramah, according to Josephus (Bell. Jud. v. 2, 1, 8) about twenty or thirty stadia from Jerusalem. These statements point to the Tell or Tuleil el Phul, i.e., bean-mountain, a conical peak about an hour from Jerusalem, on the road to er-Rm, with a large heap of stones upon the top, probably the ruins of a town that was built of unhewn stones, from which there is a very extensive prospect in all directions (Rob. ii. p. 317). Consequently modern writers have very naturally agreed in the conclusion, that the ancient Gibeah of Benjamin or Saul was situated either by the side of or upon this Tell (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 286; Strauss, Sinai, etc., p. 331, ed. 6; v. Raumer, Pal. p. 196). Kirjath has not yet been discovered, and must not be confounded with Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to the tribe of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-14.htm">Joshua 18:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-60.htm">Joshua 15:60</a>). </body></html>
