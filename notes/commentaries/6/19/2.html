If a true believer has obtained an unintended and improper advantage in any thing, he will give it up without murmuring. Love seeketh not her own, and doth not behave unseemly; it will induce those in whom it richly dwells, to part with their own to supply what is lacking to their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The inheritance of Simeon was taken out of the portion of Judah, which proved on experience to be larger than the numbers of that tribe required. The Simeonite territory is described by its towns, of which fourteen were in the Negeb, and four others <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a> partly in the Negeb and partly in "the valley." On the narrow confines here assigned to Simeon, and its insignificant position altogether among the Twelve tribes, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a> note.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 19<p>Jos 19:1-9. The Lot of Simeon.<p>1. the second lot came forth to Simeon&#8212;The next lot that was drawn at Shiloh, gave the tribe of Simeon his inheritance within the territory, which had been assigned to that of Judah. The knowledge of Canaan possessed by the Israelites, when the division of the land commenced, was but very general, being derived from the rapid sweep they had made over it during the course of conquest; and it was on the ground of that rough survey alone that the distribution proceeded, by which Judah received an inheritance. Time showed that this territory was too large (Jos 19:9), either for their numbers, however great, to occupy and their arms to defend, or too large in proportion to the allotments of the other tribes. Justice therefore required (what kind and brotherly feeling readily dictated) a modification of their possession; and a part of it was appropriated to Simeon. By thus establishing it within the original domain of another tribe, the prophecy of Jacob in regard to Simeon was fulfilled (Ge 49:7); for from its boundaries being not traced, there is reason to conclude that its people were divided and dispersed among those of Judah; and though one group of its cities named (Jos 19:2-6), gives the idea of a compact district, as it is usually represented by map makers, the other group (Jos 19:7, 8) were situated, two in the south, and two elsewhere, with tracts of the country around them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Beer-sheba, </span><span class="ital"> Sheba</span>, or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">or Sheba, </span> i.e. otherwise called; for that <span class="ital">Beer-sheba</span> and <span class="ital">Sheba</span> were one and the same city is manifest, both from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-6.htm" title="And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:">Joshua 19:6</a></span>, where all the cities are reckoned to be but <span class="ital">thirteen</span>; and from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-28.htm" title="And they dwelled at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,">1 Chronicles 4:28</a></span>, where Simeonâ€™s cities are enumerated, and <span class="ital">Sheba</span> omitted as superfluous. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they had in their inheritance Beersheba and Sheba,....

And it may be observed, that in the enumeration of the cities of Simeon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-28.htm">1 Chronicles 4:28</a>; Sheba is left out, and only Beersheba is mentioned; which, was a well known place in, the farthest border of the land of Israel southward, and the reason of its name is manifest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-28.htm">Joshua 15:28</a>, <p>and Moladah; another of the cities of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-26.htm">Joshua 15:26</a>. <p>(z) Vid.

No doubt the city, of which nothing further is known, derived its name from Beer-sheba, "the well of the oath," close by. It is true that some little difficulty is caused by the omission of this city in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-28.htm">1 Chronicles 4:28</a>, by the identification of Shehah with Beer-sheba in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-33.htm">Genesis 26:33</a>, and by the fact that in ver. 6 we are told that there were thirteen cities in this catalogue, whereas there are fourteen. On the other hand, Keil has remarked that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a> the number of names does not correspond to the whole number of cities given; and we have a Shema, probably a mistake for Sheba, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-26.htm">Joshua 15:26</a>, mentioned before Moladah among the cities of Judah. And, lastly, we have very few instances in Scripture of the disjunctive use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span>, though it seems impossible to deny that it is used in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Chephar-haammonai and Ophni are only mentioned here, and are still unknown. Gaba, or Geba of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-16.htm">1 Samuel 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>) which was given up to the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-17.htm">Joshua 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-45.htm">1 Chronicles 6:45</a>), was in the neighbourhood of Ramah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-6.htm">2 Chronicles 16:6</a>). It is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>, as the northern boundary of the kingdom of Judah, and was still inhabited after the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-30.htm">Nehemiah 7:30</a>). It is a different place from Gibea, and is not to be found, as I formerly supposed, in the Moslem village of Jibia, by the Wady el Jib, between Beitin and Sinjil (Rob. iii. p. 80), but in the small village of Jeba, which is lying half in ruins, and where there are relics of antiquity, three-quarters of an hour to the north-east of er-Rm (Ramah), and about three hours to the north of Jerusalem, upon a height from which there is an extensive prospect (vid., Rob. ii. pp. 113ff.). This eastern group also included the two other towns Anathoth and Almon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>), which were given up by Benjamin to the Levites. Anathoth, the home of the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21</a>.), which was still inhabited by Benjaminites after the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-32.htm">Nehemiah 11:32</a>), is the present village of Anta, where there are ruins of great antiquity, an hour and a quarter to the north of Jerusalem (Rob. ii. pp. 109ff.). Almon, called Allemeth in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-45.htm">1 Chronicles 6:45</a>, has been preserved in the ruins of Almt (Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 287ff.), or el-Mid (Tobler, Denkbl. p. 631), on the south-east of Anta.</body></html>
