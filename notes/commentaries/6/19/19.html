He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jezreel and its famous and fertile plain are the choicest part of the inheritance of Issachar <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>.<p>Shunem - Here the Philistines pitched before the battle of Gilboa <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-4.htm">1 Samuel 28:4</a>.

Gath-hepher, the home of the prophet Jonah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>), was "haud grandis viculus Geth" in the time of Jerome (see prol. ad Jon.). It was about two miles from Sephoris on the road to Tiberias, and the tomb of the prophet was shown there. It is the present village of Meshed, a place about an hour and a quarter to the north of Nazareth (Rob. iii. p. 209; V. de Velde, Mem. p. 312). Eth-kazin is unknown. Rimmon, a Levitical town (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-35.htm">Joshua 21:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-62.htm">1 Chronicles 6:62</a>), has probably been preserved in the village of Rummaneh, about two hours and a half to the north of Nazareth (Rob. iii. p. 195). Ham-methoar is not a proper name, but the participle of &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, with the article in the place of the relative pronoun, "bounded off," or pricked off. Neah is unknown; it is possibly the same place as Neiel in the tribe of Asher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), as Knobel supposes.</body></html>
