God, by his grace, has given us a title to a good land, the heavenly Canaan, but we are slack to take possession of it; we enter not into that rest, as we might by faith, and hope, and holy joy. How long shall it be thus with us? How long shall we thus stand in our own light, and forsake our own mercies for lying vanities? Joshua stirs the Israelites up to take possession of their lots. He is ready to do his part, if they will do theirs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Three men for each tribe - i. e. 21 in all.

Give out from among you three men for each tribe&#8212;Though the lot determined the part of the country where each tribe was to be located, it could not determine the extent of territory which might be required; and the dissatisfaction of the children of Joseph with the alleged smallness of their possession gave reason to fear that complaints might arise from other quarters, unless precautions were taken to make a proper distribution of the land. For this purpose a commission was given to twenty-one persons&#8212;three chosen from each of the seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance, to make an accurate survey of the country.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Levites have no part among you; therefore it shall be divided only into seven parts, as I have said. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the men arose, and went away,.... The seven tribes took the advice of Joshua, chose three men out of each tribe, and presented them to him, who gave them their commission and instruction to go and describe the land of Canaan, not yet disposed of, and whether subdued, or not subdued; upon which they prepared for their journey, and took it, after he had given them the following charge: <p>and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land; before they departed from him: <p>saying, go and walk through the land; and take particular notice, and an exact survey of it, both of the quality and the quantity of it: <p>and describe it; its cities and towns, hills and dales, the goodness and badness of the soil, and put it down in a book, or lay it out in a map, that it may be discerned by the eye what number of cities, and what space of ground it contains, and what parts are hilly and woody, and what otherwise: <p>and come again to me; to make a report of it: <p>that I may cast lots for you before the Lord in Shiloh; that is, for the several tribes which they belonged to, and by whom they were chosen for this purpose. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.</span><p>(g) By writing the names of every country and city.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shiloh</span> (see note on ver. 1 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>).
