All contests and selfish claims were prevented by the wise appointment of God, who allotted the hill and the valley, the corn and pasture, the brooks and rivers, the towns and cities. Is the lot of any servant of Christ cast in affliction and sorrow? It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Are we in prosperity and peace? It is from above. Be humbled when you compare the gift with your own unworthiness. Forget not Him that gave the good, and always be ready to resign it at his command.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ophrah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a> note), to be distinguished here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-17.htm">1 Samuel 13:17</a> from the Ophrah of <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>, is probably the Ephrain of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>, and the Ephraim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm">John 11:54</a>.
