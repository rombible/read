All contests and selfish claims were prevented by the wise appointment of God, who allotted the hill and the valley, the corn and pasture, the brooks and rivers, the towns and cities. Is the lot of any servant of Christ cast in affliction and sorrow? It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Are we in prosperity and peace? It is from above. Be humbled when you compare the gift with your own unworthiness. Forget not Him that gave the good, and always be ready to resign it at his command.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gaba - This name, like Gibeah, Gibeon, etc. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a>, indicates a town placed on a hill, and occurs repeatedly in various forms in the topography of Palestine. Gaba is the Gibeah (if <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-15.htm">1 Samuel 13:15-16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-5.htm">1 Samuel 14:5</a>, where the Hebrew has &#1490;&#1489;&#1506;  Geba&#8219;, which is undoubtedly the correct reading throughout. The city was one of those assigned to the Levites <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-17.htm">Joshua 21:17</a>, and lay on the northern border of Judah. It is identified with the modern "Jeba," lying on the side of a deep ravine opposite to Michmash ("Mukhmas"). The famous "Gibeah of Saul," or "Giheah of Benjamin" (the Gibeath of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>) lay at no great distance southwest of Geba, on the high road from Jerusalem to Bethel, and is probably to be looked for in the lofty and isolated "Tulcil-el-Ful."<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. the lot of &#8230; Benjamin came up&#8212;It has been supposed that there were two urns or vessels, from which the lots were drawn: one containing the names of the tribes, the other containing those of the seven portions; and that the two were drawn out simultaneously.<p>the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph&#8212;Thus the prophecy of Moses respecting the inheritance of Benjamin was remarkably accomplished.
