Those who have the commandment have it in vain, unless they do the commandment; and it will not be done aright unless we take diligent heed. In particular to love the Lord our God, as the best of beings, and the best of friends; and as far as that principle rules in the heart, there will be constant care and endeavour to walk in his ways, even those that are narrow and up-hill. In every instance to keep his commandments. At all times, and in all conditions, with purpose of heart to cleave unto the Lord, and to serve him and his kingdom among men, with all our heart, and with all our soul.

The ten commandments, and all other laws, both ceremonial and civil: <p>which Moses the servant of the Lord charged you; in the name of the Lord, to keep and observe: <p>to love the Lord your God; of which keeping the commands of God is an evidence, and which is the true principle and motive of hearty, sincere, and cheerful obedience to them: <p>and to walk in all his ways; which he has prescribed, all his ways of worship, paths of duty, faith, truth, holiness, and righteousness: <p>and to keep his commandments; whether moral, ceremonial, or judicial: whether of natural and moral obligation, or of positive institution: <p>and to cleave unto him; and not depart from his ways, worship, word, and ordinances: <p>and to serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul: in the most strict and affectionate manner. This advice Joshua thought proper to give them, and inculcate into them, now they were about to leave their brethren, and go on the other side Jordan; where they would be at a distance from the tabernacle, altar, and service of God, and might be under temptation to relinquish it, and set up another form of worship elsewhere. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.</span><p>(c) He shows where fulfilling the Law consists.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">But take diligent heed</span>] “Se onli that зe kepen attentifly.” Wyclif.

It is worthy of remark, that while beginning with the love of God, Joshua does not end there. The best proof of love is our conduct towards the person loved. If love be genuine, it is the practical principle which produces diligent service, punctual obedience, faithful attachment, the devotion of the heart and soul. <span class="cmt_word">Commandment and law.</span> The first of these words, derived from a root signifying to <span class="accented">set up</span>, has rather the force of what we call a <span class="accented">positive</span> precept, referring to single acts. The word translated <span class="accented">law</span>, derived from the root to <span class="accented">cast</span>, hence to stretch out the hand, to point out, refers rather to <span class="accented">moral</span> precepts. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and our <span class="accented">law</span> are used in the same sense. <span class="cmt_word">Cleave unto Him.</span> The Hebrew is stronger, cleave <span class="accented">into</span> Him, as though regarding not so much isolated actions as principles of life. Our life was to be "rooted and grounded," to use an apostolic phrase, in His. But the full significance of these words could not be understood till One had come who enabled us by faith to "eat His flesh and drink His blood," and so be united to Him as the branch to its root. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He had also procured them rest round about, as He had sworn to their fathers, inasmuch as not a man of all their enemies stood against them. The expression "gave them rest," etc., points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9-10</a>, and refers to all the divine promises of the Pentateuch which assured the Israelites of the peaceable possession of Canaan, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-20.htm">Deuteronomy 3:20</a>, etc. No enemy had been able to withstand them, as the Lord had promised Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). "The Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand." It is true the Canaanites were not all exterminated; but those who were left had become so powerless, that they could neither accomplish nor attempt anything against Israel, so long as the Israelites adhered faithfully to their God, or so long as Joshua and the elders who were his contemporaries were alive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm">Judges 2:6</a>.), because the Lord had overwhelmed them with fear and terror before the Israelites.<p>(Note: "If any one should raise a question as to their actual peace, the solution is easy enough. The tribes of Canaan were so alarmed and broken down with their fear, that in their opinion nothing could serve their purpose better than to purchase peace from the children of Israel by the most obsequious servility. Clearly, therefore, the land was subdued and their home at peace, since no one disturbed them, or attempted anything against them; there were no threats, no snares, no violence, and no conspiracy." - Calvin.)</body></html>
