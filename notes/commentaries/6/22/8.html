This seems to have been constantly the custom among the Israelites: those who were detached upon any military expedition, gave the rest of the army a share of the booty they had taken from the enemy; the pagans acted in like manner; God himself enjoined this practice after the war against the Midianites. Those who fought kept half the spoil of the enemy, and gave the other half to the rest of the people. Probably the same proportion was observed on this occasion. David, on his return from pursuing the Amalekites, changed this custom into a law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/30-24.htm" title="For who will listen to you in this matter? but as his part is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarries by the stuff: they shall part alike....">1 Samuel 30:24-25</a>.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-9 Joshua dismisses the tribes with good counsel. Those who have the commandment have it in vain, unless they do the commandment; and it will not be done aright unless we take diligent heed. In particular to love the Lord our God, as the best of beings, and the best of friends; and as far as that principle rules in the heart, there will be constant care and endeavour to walk in his ways, even those that are narrow and up-hill. In every instance to keep his commandments. At all times, and in all conditions, with purpose of heart to cleave unto the Lord, and to serve him and his kingdom among men, with all our heart, and with all our soul.

The Jewish historian scarcely ever quotes or reminds, but repeats so much as may be necessary to make his account of the transaction in hand fully intelligible by itself.

It is quite possible, however, that the particulars special to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>, may be due to some other narrative of the whole event than that to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-5.htm">Joshua 22:5</a> belongs, and may have been interwoven by a later reviser. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches&#8212;in cattle, clothes, and precious metals.<p>divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren&#8212;(See on [205]Nu 31:25-39).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. With them who staid beyond Jordan for the defence of their land, and wives, and children, who therefore were to have a share, though not an equal share, with these.

To the half tribe of Manasseh only, though some think also to the other ten tribes: <p>saying, return with much riches unto your tents; that is, return to their own land, and habitations there, with whatsoever riches they had got from the spoil of the enemy: <p>and with very much cattle; they had taken from them, and fell to their share, and for which they had good pasturage in Gilead and Bashan, and therefore very proper to take with them: <p>with silver and with gold, and with brass, and with iron; whether in massive pieces, or wrought up into vessels, which they found in the houses of the Canaanites when they plundered them: <p>and with very much raiment; some no doubt very rich and costly, such as their kings, princes, nobles, and great personages among them wore: <p>divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren; according to Jarchi and Kimchi, this is spoken to the half tribe of Manasseh, to divide their spoil with the tribes of Reuben and Gad; but it rather means the dividing the above spoil, when they came to their own country with their brethren they left behind; who as they were employed in guarding and defending their cities, their wives and children, herds and flocks, in their absence, they had a right to part of the spoil; and as in other instances it appears to be a common case for those that stayed at home to share in the spoil with them that went to war, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-27.htm">Numbers 31:27</a>; though the notion of Abarbinel pleases me best, that by "their brethren" are meant the other half tribe of Manasseh that remained in Canaan, and were settled there: when the spoil of the Canaanites was divided among all the tribes, the whole tribe of Manasseh had its share; and whereas now half of it were going to their own country on the other side Jordan, it was but reasonable they should have their part of the spoil to carry with them; and this seems to be the true reason of their being separately addressed, and dismissed and blessed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> brethren.</span><p>(e) Who remained at home and did not go to the war, Nu 31:27 1Sa 30:24.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">with your brethren</span>] i.e. with the members of the tribes who had remained on the east side of the Jordan, to whom, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-27.htm" title="And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war on them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:">Numbers 31:27</a>, one half belonged.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Riches</span>.
