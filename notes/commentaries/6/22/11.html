The design was to set up on the east of Jordan a likeness of that altar which was established on the west, that the tribes on the other side of Jordan might appeal to it as a proof that they also were the people of Jehovah.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:10-20 Here is the care of the separated tribes to keep their hold of Canaan's religion. At first sight it seemed a design to set up an altar against the altar at Shiloh. God is jealous for his own institutions; we should be so too, and afraid of every thing that looks like, or leads to idolatry. Corruptions in religion are best dealt with at first. But their prudence in following up this zealous resolution is no less commendable. Many an unhappy strife would be prevented, or soon made up, by inquiries into the matter of the offence. The remembrance of great sins committed formerly, should engage us to stand on our guard against the beginnings of sin; for the way of sin is down-hill. We are all concerned to reprove our neighbour when he does amiss, lest we suffer sin upon him, Le 19:17. The offer made that they should be welcome to come to the land where the Lord's tabernacle was, and settle there, was in the spirit of true Israelites.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The two tribes and a half erected this altar in order to keep alive their claim to have the same interest as the other tribes had in the sanctuary of God, which was established on the west side of Jordan: and in order to forestall any assertion that the Jordan itself was a natural barrier of exclusion between them and the sanctuary, they built it on the west or Canaanite bank of the Jordan and not on the east.<p>The word rendered "borders" is noteworthy; it means circuits, arrondissements. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 22:11-29.

The act being suspected of some idolatrous design, the tribes rose in a mass, and repairing to the tabernacle at Shiloh, resolved to declare war against the two tribes and a half as apostates from God. On calmer and more mature consideration, however, they determined, in the first instance, to send a deputation consisting of the son of the high priest, and ten eminent persons from each tribe, to make inquiry into this rumored rebellion against God (De 13:13-15). The quality of the deputies evinced the deep solicitude that was felt on the occasion to maintain the purity of the divine worship throughout Israel. In the presumptive belief that the two tribes and a half had really built an altar, the deputies expressed astonishment at their so soon falling into such a heinous crime as that of violating the unity of divine worship (Ex 20:24; Leviticus 17:8, 9; De 12:5-13). They reminded their eastern brethren of the disastrous consequences that were entailed on the nation at large by the apostasy at Peor and by the sin of Achan, and finally exhorted them, if they felt the want of the tabernacle and altar and repented of their rash choice in preferring worldly advantages to religious privileges, to remove to the western side of the Jordan, where all the tribes would form a united and obedient community of worshippers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Where they passed over Jordan, either at their first entrance into Canaan, or afterwards, and usually. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Israel heard say,.... Those that dwelt in the land of Canaan, for otherwise, as before observed, the two tribes and a half on the other side Jordan were Israelites also; and this is a further proof that the altar was built on their side, or those in the land of Canaan would have known of the building of it, and have seen them at it, and not come at the knowledge of it by hearsay only, as it seems they did, it being reported to them by some who had been in those parts, and had seen the structure: <p>behold, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, have built an altar over against the land of Canaan; which clearly shows it was on the other side Jordan, though Noldius, who places it in the land of Canaan, renders the words, "in the neighbourhood of" it (l); which will not much help him, since it might be in the neighbourhood of it, and yet not in it: <p>in the borders of Jordan; on the banks of it, or in one of the meanders and windings of it, at a place where it ran out and fetched a compass in the land of Canaan: <p>at the passage of the children of Israel; where they passed over when they first came into Canaan, and where those tribes also passed over at their return; supposed to be the Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>. <p>(l)  "in vicinia", Noldius, No. 369. p. 80. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/joshua/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>11–20.

It is difficult to fix the meaning of this expression. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> seems to have meant <span class="accented">the front</span> of anything, and therefore <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> would naturally mean <span class="accented">towards</span> the front of, or <span class="accented">in</span> front cf. Thus we have had the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a> (where see note), where it seems to mean, <span class="accented">in the direction of</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1</a>, where it seems to have the same meaning. With verbs of motion it signifies <span class="accented">towards</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-30.htm">1 Samuel 17:30</a>. Here it clearly cannot be pressed to mean <span class="accented">across</span> Jordan. See note below. <span class="cmt_word">The borders of Jordan.</span> As above, ver. 10, the <span class="accented">circles</span> of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">At the passage of the children of Israel.</span> The word translated "the passage of," literally," unto over," has originally the sense of "across." Here, however, it means "<span class="accented">towards</span> <span class="accented">the region opposite to the sons of Israel," i.e., in the direction of</span> the country on the other side Jordan. The country across Jordan was usually designated as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> Jordan. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, the phrase used here, we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-26.htm">Exodus 28:26</a>, apparently in the sense of <span class="accented">across</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-19.htm">Exodus 39:19</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-13.htm">Deuteronomy 30:13</a> it is used of moving in the direction of a place, "across" or "over the sea." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9, 12</a>, with the addition of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, the phrase means "straight forward." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-40.htm">1 Samuel 14:40</a> <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> means "on one side."
