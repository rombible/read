With solemnity and meekness they proceeded to give all the satisfaction in their power. Reverence of God is expressed in the form of their appeal. This brief confession of faith would remove their brethren's suspicion that they intended to worship other gods. Let us always speak of God with seriousness, and mention his name with a solemn pause. Those who make appeals to Heaven with a careless God knows, take his name in vain: it is very unlike this. They express great confidence of their own uprightness in the matter of their appeal. God knows it, for he is perfectly acquainted with the thoughts and intents of the heart. In every thing we do in religion, it highly concerns us to approve ourselves to God, remembering that he knows the heart. And if our sincerity be known to God, we should study likewise to let others know it by its fruits, especially those who, though they mistake us, show zeal for the glory of God. They disdained the design of which they were suspected to be guilty, and fully explained their true intent in building this altar. Those who have found the comfort and benefit of God's ordinances, cannot but desire to preserve them to their seed, and to use all possible care that their children may be looked upon as having a part in him. Christ is the great Altar that sanctifies every gift; the best evidence of our interest in him is the work of his Spirit in our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The repeated invocation of God, and that by His three names - &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l, &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym, &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a> - marks the earnestness of the protestation.

"Is there too little for us in the iniquity of Peor (i.e., with Peor, or through the worship of Peor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a>), from which we have not cleansed ourselves till this day, and there came the plague upon the congregation of Jehovah?" &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; is an accusative: see Ges. 117, 2; Ewald, 277, d. That plague, of which 24,000 Israelites died, was stayed through the zeal of Phinehas for the honour of the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4-9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>). The guilt connected with the worship of Peor had thereby been avenged upon the congregation, and the congregation itself had been saved from any further punishment in consequence of the sin. When Phinehas, therefore, affirmed that the congregation had not yet been cleansed from the crime, he did not mean that they were still bearing or suffering from the punishment of that crime, but that they were not yet cleansed from that sin, inasmuch as many of them were still attached to idolatry in their hearts, even if they had hitherto desisted from it outwardly from fear of the infliction of fresh judgment. </body></html>
