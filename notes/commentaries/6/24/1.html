And what is spoken is addressed to the people in the hearing of the rulers. In the speech that now follows Joshua briefly recapitulates the national history; he had not thought this necessary for the rulers. To them he had said, “Ye know;” but “the people” embraced many persons of but little thought and education, whom it was necessary to inform and remind and instruct, even as to the leading events of their national history. The simple lesson which Joshua’s words are intended to enforce is the duty of <span class= "ital">serving Jehovah, </span>and <span class= "ital">serving Him alone. </span>It is the first great lesson of the old covenant. “I am Jehovah, thy God; thou shalt have no other gods beside Me.” The ark of this covenant had brought them over Jordan into the promised land.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood.</span>—The flood, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the river—probably Euphrates, though it may be Jordan, or both.

Or perhaps it was Joshua’s custom to assemble them frequently, in order that he might remind them of their duty, and enforce it upon them. <span class="ital">All the tribes of Israel — </span>Namely, their representatives, or, as it follows, their elders, their heads, their judges, and officers. <span class="ital">To Shechem — </span>To the city of Shechem, a place convenient for the purpose, not only because it was a Levitical city, and a city of refuge, and a place near Joshua’s city, but especially for the two main ends for which he summoned them thither. 1st, For the solemn burial of the bones of Joseph, and probably of some others of the patriarchs, for which this place was designed. 2d, For the solemn renewing of their covenant with God; which in this place was first made between God and Abraham, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land....">Genesis 12:6-7</a>,) and afterward renewed by the Israelites at their first entrance into the land of Canaan, between the two mountains of Ebal and Gerizim, (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm" title="Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,">Joshua 8:30</a>, &c.,) which were very near Shechem: and therefore this place was most proper, both to remind them of their former obligations to God, and to engage them to a further ratification of them. <span class="ital">Before God — </span>As in God’s presence, to hear what Joshua was to speak to them in God’s name, and to receive God’s commands from his mouth.

If he lengthen out our days beyond what we expected, like those of Joshua, it is because he has some further service for us to do. He who aims at the same mind which was in Christ Jesus, will glory in bearing the last testimony to his Saviour's goodness, and in telling to all around, the obligations with which the unmerited goodness of God has bound him. The assembly came together in a solemn religious manner. Joshua spake to them in God's name, and as from him. His sermon consists of doctrine and application. The doctrinal part is a history of the great things God had done for his people, and for their fathers before them. The application of this history of God's mercies to them, is an exhortation to fear and serve God, in gratitude for his favour, and that it might be continued.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shechem, situated between those mountains, Ebal and Gerizim, which had already been the scene of a solemn rehearsal of the covenant soon after the first entry of the people into the promised land <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a>, was a fitting scene for the solemn renewal on the part of the people of that covenant with God which had been on His part so signally and so fully kept. The spot itself suggested the allusions to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, etc., in Joshua's address; and its associations could not but give special force and moving effect to his appeals. This address was not made to the rulers only but to the whole nation, not of course to the tribes assembled in mass, but to their representatives. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Jos 24:1. Joshua Assembling the Tribes.<p>1. Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem&#8212;Another and final opportunity of dissuading the people against idolatry is here described as taken by the aged leader, whose solicitude on this account arose from his knowledge of the extreme readiness of the people to conform to the manners of the surrounding nations. This address was made to the representatives of the people convened at Shechem, and which had already been the scene of a solemn renewal of the covenant (Jos 8:30, 35). The transaction now to be entered upon being in principle and object the same, it was desirable to give it all the solemn impressiveness which might be derived from the memory of the former ceremonial, as well as from other sacred associations of the place (Ge 12:6, 7; 33:18-20; 35:2-4).<p>they presented themselves before God&#8212;It is generally assumed that the ark of the covenant had been transferred on this occasion to Shechem; as on extraordinary emergencies it was for a time removed (Jud 20:1-18; 1Sa 4:3; 2Sa 15:24).

But there is not the slightest MSS. authority for the reading, and it is contrary to all sound principles of criticism to resort to arbitrary emendations of the text. Besides, the LXX. itself reads <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;</span>, in ver. 26, and adds, "before the tabernacle of the God of Israel," words implied, but not expressed in the Hebrew. We are therefore driven to the supposition that this gathering was one yet more solemn than the one described in the previous chapter. The tabernacle was no doubt removed on this great occasion to Shechem. The locality, as Poole reminds us, was well calculated to inspire the Israelites with the deepest feelings. It was the scene of God's first covenant with Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6, 7</a>), and of the formal renewal of the covenant related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2-4</a> (see note on vers. 23, 26), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a>, when the blessings and the curses were inscribed on Mount Gerizim and Ebal, and the place where Joseph's bones (ver. 32) were laid, possibly at this time, or if not, at the time when the blessings and curses were inscribed. And now, once again, a formal renewal of the covenant was demanded from Israel by their aged chieftain, before his voice should cease to be heard among them any more. Rosenmuller reminds us that Josephus, the Chaldee and Syriac translators, and the Aldine and Complutensian editions of the LXX. itself, have Sichem. Bishop Horsley makes the very reasonable suggestion that Shiloh was not as yet the name of a town, but possibly of the tabernacle itself, or the district in which it had been pitched. And he adds that Mizpeh and Sheehem, not Shiloh, appear to have been the places fixed upon for the gathering of the tribes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a> (cf. ver. 27); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5</a>). See, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-12.htm">Judges 21:12</a>, as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-12.htm">Joshua 22:12</a>. Some additional probability is given to this view by the fact noticed above, that it is thought necessary to describe the situation of Shiloh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>, and we may also fail to notice that the words translated "house of God" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18, 26</a> in our version, is in reality Bethel, there being no "house of God" properly so called, but only the "tabernacle of the congregation." The tabernacle in that ease would be moved from place to place within the central district assigned to it, as necessity or convenience dictated. Hengstenberg objects to the idea that the tabernacle was moved to Shechem that it would have led to an idea that God was only present in His Holy Place, to which it is sufficient to <span class="accented">reply</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that this does not necessarily follow, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that such a conception was entertained, though erroneously, by some minds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Samaritan woman, for instance, supposed the Jews to believe that in Jerusalem only ought men to worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>). When Hengstenberg says, however, that the meeting in the last chapter had reference to Israel from a theocratic and religious, and this one from an historical point of view, he is on firmer ground. The former exhortation is ethical, this historical. He goes on to refer to the deeply interesting historical traditions centering round this place, which have been noticed above. The oak in ver. 26, Hengstenberg maintains to be the same tree that is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> (where our version has, erroneously, "plain"), and which is referred to both in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a> and here <span class="accented">as the</span> (<span class="accented">i.e</span>, the well known) terebinth in Shechem (see note on ver. 26). He has overlooked the fact that the tree in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> is not an <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> but an <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. He goes on to contend that the terebinth was not merely "by" but "in" the sanctuary of the Lord, which he supposes to be another sanctuary beside the tabernacle, perhaps the sacred enclosure round Abraham's altar. But he is wrong, as has been shown below, (ver. 26), when he says that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> never signifies near (see Joshua 5:25). The question is one of much difficulty, and cannot be satisfactorily settled. But we may dismiss without fear, in the light of the narative in ch. 22, Knobel's suggestion that an altar was erected here on this occasion. If there were any altar, it must have been the altar in the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">Other gods.</span> That the family of Nahor were not exactly worshippers of the one true God in the same pure ritual as Abraham, may be gathered from the fact that Laban had teraphim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19, 30</a>). But recent researches have thrown some light on the condition of Abraham's family and ancestors. If Ur Casdim be identified, as recent discoverers have supposed, with Mugeyer, which, though west of Euphrates as a whole, is yet to the eastward of one of its subordinate channels (see 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arebaeology,' 3:229; Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p. 4), its ruins give us plentiful information concerning the creed of its inhabitants. We may also find some information about this primeval city in Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:15, and in Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries,' p. 233. The principal building of this city is the temple of the moon god Ur. One of the liturgical hymns to this moon god is in existence, and has been translated into French by M. Lenormant. In it the moon is addressed as Father, earth enlightening god, primeval seer, giver of life, king of kings, and the like. The sun and stars seem also to have been objects of worship, and a highly developed polytheistic system seems to have culminated in the horrible custom of human sacrifices. This was a recognised practice among the early Accadians, a Turanian race which preceded the Semitic in these regions. A fragment of an early Accadian hymn has been preserved, in which the words "his offspring for his life he gave" occur, and it seems that the Semitic people of Ur adopted it from them. A similar view is attributed to Balak in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-5.htm">Micah 6:5, 6</a>, and was probably derived from documents which have since perished (see Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p 24). Hence, no doubt the Moloch, or Molech, worship which was common in the neighbourhood of Palestine, and which the descendants of Abraham on their first entrance thither rejected with such disgust (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>, where Abraham seems to have some difficulties connected with his ancestral creed). Other deities were worshipped in the Ur of the Chaldees. Sumas, the sun god, Nana, the equivalent of Astarte, the daughter of the moon god, Bel and Belat, "his lady." "In truth," says Mr. Tomkins, in the work above cited, "polytheism was stamped on the earth in temples and towers, and the warlike and beneficent works of kings. Rimmon was the patron of the all-important irrigation, Sin of brickmaking and building, Nergal of war." A full account of these deities will be found in Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For this reason the Lord had driven out great and strong nations before the Israelites, so that no one was able to stand before them.

To this there is attached, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-11.htm">Joshua 23:11-13</a>, the admonition to take heed for the sake of their souls (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>), to love the Lord their God (on the love of God as the sum of the fulfilment of the law, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>). For if they turned, i.e., gave up the faithfulness they had hitherto displayed towards Jehovah, and attached themselves to the remnant of these nations, made marriages with them, and entered into fellowship with them, which the Lord had expressly forbidden (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), let them know that the Lord their God would not cut off these nations before them any more, but that they would be a snare and destruction to them. This threat is founded upon such passages of the law as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>, and more especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>. The figure of a trap, which is employed here (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>), is still further strengthened by &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, a snare (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>). Shotet, a whip or scourge, an emphatic form of the word derived from the poel of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, only occurs here. "Scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>). Joshua crowds his figures together to depict the misery and oppression which would be sure to result from fellowship with the Canaanites, because, from his knowledge of the fickleness of the people, and the wickedness of the human heart in its natural state, he could foresee that the apostasy of the nation from the Lord, which Moses had foretold, would take place but too quickly; as it actually did, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>., in the very next generation. The words "until ye perish," etc., resume the threat held out by Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a> (cf. Josh Deu 28:21.). </body></html>
