If he lengthen out our days beyond what we expected, like those of Joshua, it is because he has some further service for us to do. He who aims at the same mind which was in Christ Jesus, will glory in bearing the last testimony to his Saviour's goodness, and in telling to all around, the obligations with which the unmerited goodness of God has bound him. The assembly came together in a solemn religious manner. Joshua spake to them in God's name, and as from him. His sermon consists of doctrine and application. The doctrinal part is a history of the great things God had done for his people, and for their fathers before them. The application of this history of God's mercies to them, is an exhortation to fear and serve God, in gratitude for his favour, and that it might be continued.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The other side of the flood - Better "On the other side of the river," i. e. the Euphrates. See the marginal reference.<p>They served other gods - Possibly the "images," or teraphim, which we find their ancestor Laban calling "his gods" (see the marginal reference); and of which it would seem that there were, as Joshua spoke, some secret devotees among the people <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>. It is not stated that Abraham himself was an idolater, though his fathers were. Jewish tradition asserts that Abraham while in Ur of the Chaldees was persecuted for his abhorrence of idolatry, and hence, was called away by God from his native land. The reference in the text to the original state of those who were the forefathers of the nation, is made to show that they were no better than others: God chose them not for their excellences but of His own mere motion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The mention of hornets in the prophecies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-28.htm">Exodus 23:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-20.htm">Deuteronomy 7:20</a> is not conclusive. In the former passage the hornet seems to be connected with the fear that was to be felt at their advance. The latter passage is not conclusive on either side. The probability is - since we have no mention of hornets in the history - that what is meant is that kind of unreasonable and panic fear which seems, to persons too far off to discern the assailants, to be displayed by persons attacked by these apparently insignificant insects. The image is a lively and natural one, and it well expresses the dismay which, as we read, seized the inhabitants of the land when their foes, formidable rather from Divine protection then from their number or warlike equipments, had crossed the Jordan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>). Where the figure came from is not far to seek. Joshua was quoting the prophecies of Moses mentioned above. <span class="cmt_word">The two kings of the Amorites.</span> Sihon and Og, who were driven out, beside the tribes on the other side Jordan who have just been mentioned. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of this also he merely mentions the leading points, viz., first of all, the sending of Moses and Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-14.htm">Joshua 4:14</a>.), and then the plagues inflicted upon Egypt. "I smote Egypt," i.e., both land and people. &#1504;&#1490;&#1507; is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-2.htm">Exodus 8:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-27.htm">Exodus 12:27</a>, in connection with the plague of frogs and the slaying of the first-born in Egypt. The words which follow, "according to that which I did among them, and afterward I brought you out," point back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>, and show that the Lord had fulfilled the promise given to Moses at his call. He then refers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-6.htm">Joshua 24:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-7.htm">Joshua 24:7</a>) to the miraculous deliverance of the Israelites, as they came out of Egypt, from Pharaoh who pursued them with his army, giving especial prominence to the crying of the Israelites to the Lord in their distress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10</a>), and the relief of that distress by the angel of the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19-20</a>). And lastly, he notices their dwelling in the wilderness "many days," i.e., forty years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>).</body></html>
