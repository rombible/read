Some think this covenant was now established by sacrifice, as it was when they came out of Egypt, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/24-4.htm" title="And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel....">Exodus 24:4-5</a>,) and when they came into Canaan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-31.htm" title="As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man has lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.">Joshua 8:31</a>. But as there is no mention of an altar or any offering, so it is not likely that Joshua would offer any sacrifice but in the place which God had chosen, which was Shiloh.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:15-28 It is essential that the service of God's people be performed with a willing mind. For LOVE is the only genuine principle whence all acceptable service of God can spring. The Father seeks only such to worship him, as worship him in spirit and in truth. The carnal mind of man is enmity against God, therefore, is not capable of such spiritual worship. Hence the necessity of being born again. But numbers rest in mere forms, as tasks imposed upon them. Joshua puts them to their choice; but not as if it were indifferent whether they served God or not. Choose you whom ye will serve, now the matter is laid plainly before you. He resolves to do this, whatever others did. Those that are bound for heaven, must be willing to swim against the stream. They must not do as the most do, but as the best do. And no one can behave himself as he ought in any station, who does not deeply consider his religious duties in family relations. The Israelites agree with Joshua, being influenced by the example of a man who had been so great a blessing to them; We also will serve the Lord. See how much good great men do, by their influence, if zealous in religion. Joshua brings them to express full purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord. They must come off from all confidence in their own sufficiency, else their purposes would be in vain. The service of God being made their deliberate choice, Joshua binds them to it by a solemn covenant. He set up a monument of it. In this affecting manner Joshua took his last leave of them; if they perished, their blood would be upon their own heads. Though the house of God, the Lord's table, and even the walls and trees before which we have uttered our solemn purposes of serving him, would bear witness against us if we deny him, yet we may trust in him, that he will put his fear into our hearts, that we shall not depart from him. God alone can give grace, yet he blesses our endeavours to engage men to his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Made a covenant with the people - i. e. he solemnly ratified and renewed the covenant of Sinai, as Moses had done before him <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-1.htm">Deuteronomy 29:1</a>.

Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth&#8212;After having enumerated so many grounds for national gratitude, Joshua calls on them to declare, in a public and solemn manner, whether they will be faithful and obedient to the God of Israel. He avowed this to be his own unalterable resolution, and urged them, if they were sincere in making a similar avowal, "to put away the strange gods that were among them"&#8212;a requirement which seems to imply that some were suspected of a strong hankering for, or concealed practice of, the idolatry, whether in the form of Zabaism, the fire-worship of their Chaldean ancestors, or the grosser superstitions of the Canaanites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="ital">He set</span>, or propounded, or declared <span class="ital">unto them the statute and ordinance</span>, i.e. the sum of the statutes and ordinances of God, which their covenant obliged them to Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. <span class="ital">He set</span> or established it, to wit, that covenant, with them, i.e. the people <span class="ital">for a statute or an ordinance</span>, to bind themselves and their posterity unto God for ever, as a statute and ordinance of God doth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joshua/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day,....

The word used for covenant<span class="accented">, berith</span>, is derived from another word having the same meaning. This appears more probable than the suggestion of some, that the <span class="accented">berith</span> is derived from the practice of ratifying an agreement by a social meal. <span class="cmt_word">And set them a statute and ordinance.</span> Or, <span class="accented">appointed them a statute and a judgment.</span> The word translated "statute" is derived from the same root as our word <span class="accented">hack</span>, signifying to <span class="accented">cut</span>, and hence to engrave in indelible characters. The practice of engraving inscriptions, proclamations, and the like, on tablets was extremely common in the East. We have instances of it in the two tables of the law, and in the copy of the law engraven in stones on Mount Ebal. The Moabite stone is another instance. And the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian monarchs seem to have written much of their history in this way (see note on Joshua 8:32). The word rendered "ordinance" is far more frequently rendered "judgment" in our version, and seems to have the original signification of a thing set upright, as a pillar on a secure foundation. <span class="cmt_word">In Shechem</span> (see note on ver. 1). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But in order to place most vividly before the minds of the people to what it was that they bound themselves by this declaration, that they might not inconsiderately vow what they would not afterwards observe, Joshua adds, "Ye cannot serve Jehovah," sc., in the state of mind in which ye are at present, or "by your own resolution only, and without the assistance of divine grace, without solid and serious conversion from all idols, and without true repentance and faith" (J. H. Michaelis). For Jehovah is "a holy God," etc. Elohim, used to denote the Supreme Being (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>), is construed with the predicate in the plural. On the holiness of God, see the exposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>. On the expression "a jealous God," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; and on &#1500;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>.
