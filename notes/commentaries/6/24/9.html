Whether Balak himself ever led an army against Israel we are not informed. In the war with the Midianites, Balaam was slain; and there may have been Moabites allied and acting with the Midianites in the war in Numbers 31.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joshua/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/24-9.htm" title="Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:...">Joshua 24:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Balak warred against Israel — </span>Not indeed by open force, but by crafty counsels, warlike stratagems, and wicked devices. <span class="ital">I would not hearken unto Balaam — </span>It appears by this that Balaam had a great inclination to do what Balak desired, and that he asked leave of God to curse Israel; and therefore it is not strange that God, who permitted him simply to go, was highly angry with him for going with so wicked an intent, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him.

If he lengthen out our days beyond what we expected, like those of Joshua, it is because he has some further service for us to do. He who aims at the same mind which was in Christ Jesus, will glory in bearing the last testimony to his Saviour's goodness, and in telling to all around, the obligations with which the unmerited goodness of God has bound him. The assembly came together in a solemn religious manner. Joshua spake to them in God's name, and as from him. His sermon consists of doctrine and application. The doctrinal part is a history of the great things God had done for his people, and for their fathers before them. The application of this history of God's mercies to them, is an exhortation to fear and serve God, in gratitude for his favour, and that it might be continued.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joshua/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The other side of the flood - Better "On the other side of the river," i. e. the Euphrates.

It is not stated that Abraham himself was an idolater, though his fathers were. Jewish tradition asserts that Abraham while in Ur of the Chaldees was persecuted for his abhorrence of idolatry, and hence, was called away by God from his native land. The reference in the text to the original state of those who were the forefathers of the nation, is made to show that they were no better than others: God chose them not for their excellences but of His own mere motion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joshua/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

To the latter He gave the mountains of Seir for a possession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-6.htm">Genesis 36:6</a>.), that Jacob might receive Canaan for his descendants as a sole possession. But instead of mentioning this, Joshua took for granted that his hearers were well acquainted with the history of the patriarchs, and satisfied himself with mentioning the migration of Jacob and his sons to Egypt, that he might pass at once to the second great practical proof of the mercy of God in the guidance of Israel, the miraculous deliverance of Israel out of the bondage and oppression of Egypt.</body></html>
