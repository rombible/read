Notice also the death and burial of Joshua, and of Eleazar the chief priest. The most useful men, having served their generation, according to the will of God, one after another, fall asleep and see corruption. But Jesus, having spent and ended his life on earth more effectually than either Joshua or Joseph, rose from the dead, and saw no corruption. And the redeemed of the Lord shall inherit the kingdom he prepared for them from the foundation of the world. They will say in admiration of the grace of Jesus, Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.

The eminent public services he had long rendered to Israel and the great amount of domestic comfort and national prosperity he had been instrumental in diffusing among the several tribes, were deeply felt, were universally acknowledged; and a testimonial in the form of a statue or obelisk would have been immediately raised to his honor, in all parts of the land, had such been the fashion of the times.

Death of Joshua and Eleazar<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">And it came to pass</span>] With the close of Joshua’s parting address comes the close also of his own life. The historian proceeds to bring the book to a conclusion, and tells us of (i) the death of Joshua; (ii) the conduct of the people after his death; (iii) the burial of the remains of Joseph, which had been brought out of Egypt; (iv) the death of Eleazar the high-priest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Joshua … the servant of the Lord, died</span>] His work was now over. His work of war, and his work of peace. His age when he died was precisely that which Joseph reached (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-26.htm" title="So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.">Genesis 50:26</a>), a hundred and ten years.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span>  - <span class="cmt_word">The servant of the Lord.</span> The theory of some commentators, that this expression is evidence of a later interpolation because "the title only dates, from the period when Moses, Joshua, and others were raised to the rank of national saints," need only be noticed to be rejected. It is a fair specimen of the inventive criticism which has found favour among modern critics, in which a large amount of imagination is made to supply the want of the smallest modicum of fact. What is wanting here is the slightest evidence of such a "period" having ever existed, except at the time when these saints of the old covenant closed their labours by death. All the facts before us go to prove that Moses, as well as Joshua, was held in as high, if not higher, veneration at the moment of his death as at any other period of Jewish history. <span class="cmt_word">Died</span>. His was an end which any man might envy. Honoured and beloved, and full of days, he closed his life amid the regrets of a whole people, and with the full consciousness that he had discharged the duties God had imposed upon trim. The best proof of the estimation in which he was held is contained in ver. 32. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joshua/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Upon this repeated declaration Joshua says to them, "ye are witnesses against yourselves," i.e., ye will condemn yourselves by this your own testimony if ye should now forsake the Lord, "for ye yourselves have chosen you Jehovah to serve Him;" whereupon they answer &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, "witnesses are we against ourselves," signifying thereby, "we profess and ratify once more all that we have said" (Rosenmller). Joshua then repeated his demand that they should put away the strange gods from within them, and incline their hearts (entirely) to Jehovah the God of Israel. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; might mean the foreign gods which are in the midst of you, i.e., among you, and imply the existence of idols, and the grosser forms of idolatrous worship in the nation; but &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; also signifies "within," or "in the heart," in which case the words refer to idols of the heart. That the latter is the sense in which the words are to be understood is evident from the fact, that although the people expressed their willingness to renounce all idolatry, they did not bring any idols to Joshua to be destroyed, as was done in other similar cases, viz., <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a>. Even if the people had carried idols about with them in the desert, as the prophet Amos stated to his contemporaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>), the grosser forms of idolatry had disappeared from Israel with the dying out of the generation that was condemned at Kadesh. The new generation, which had been received afresh into covenant with the Lord by the circumcision at Gilgal, and had set up this covenant at Ebal, and was now assembled around Joshua, the dying servant of God, to renew the covenant once more, had no idols of wood, stone, or metal, but only the "figments of false gods," as Calvin calls them, the idols of the heart, which it was to put away, that it might give its heart entirely to the Lord, who is not content with divided affections, but requires the whole heart (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5-6</a>). </body></html>
