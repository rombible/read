(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1Peter 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1Peter 5:4</a>; see also <span class= "ital">Epistle of Barnabas, </span>iv. 12.)<p><span class= "bld">As they that count.</span>—We must begin a fresh sentence, and somewhat modify the translation. “To riot” is too strong; the word means “delicate fare, dainty living, luxury,” and if the exact meaning be retained, this will necessitate a change of “in the day time.” For though “rioting in the day time” makes good sense—revelry even among professed pleasure seekers being usually confined to the night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm" title="For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:7</a>)—“dainty fare in the day time” does not seem to have much point. The meaning is, perhaps, “for the day,” without thought for the morrow, <span class= "ital">counting luxury for the moment a pleasure</span>—the doctrine of the Cyrenaics and the instinct of “brute beasts.” In the <span class= "ital">Shepherd</span> of Hermas (<span class= "ital">Sim. VI.</span> iv. 4) there is a passage which may possibly be an echo of this: “The time of luxury and deceit is one hour, but the hours of torment have the power of thirty days; if, then, a man luxuriates for one day,” &c. &c. (See below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm" title="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.">2Peter 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2Peter 3:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Sporting themselves.</span>—The word is a compound of the one just translated “luxury”; hence <span class= "ital">luxuriating.</span> It is worth noting that the words for “spots and blemishes” exactly correspond to the words translated “without blemish and without spot” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>.

But both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>, the reading is uncertain, authorities being divided between <span class= "ital">agapai, </span>“love-feasts,” and <span class= "ital">apatai, </span>“deceits.” In Jude the balance on purely critical grounds is decidedly in favour of “love-feasts;” here (though much less decidedly) in favour of “deceits.” In Jude the context confirms the reading “love-feasts;” here the context is neutral, or slightly inclines to “love-feasts,” to which “while they feast with you” must in any case refer. But if “love-feasts” be right in Jude (and this is so probable that we may almost assume it), this in itself is strong support to the same reading here. Whichever writer is prior, so strange a change from “deceits” to “love-feasts” would hardly have been made deliberately; whereas, in copying mechanically, the interchange might easily be made, the words being so similar. The change from “spots” to “rocks,” if such a change has been deliberately made by either writer (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>), would not be parallel to a change between “deceits” and “love-feasts.” The one is a mere variation of the metaphor, the other an alteration of the meaning. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.">2Thessalonians 2:10</a> there is possibly an intentional play upon the similarity of these two words.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up to their own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it.

Such people do not always receive the due recompense of their deeds in the present life; and as it is a great and immutable principle that all will be treated, under the government of God, as they deserve, or that justice will be rendered to every rational being, it follows that there must be punishment in the future state.<p>As they that count it pleasure to riot in the day-time - As especially wicked, shameless, and abandoned men; for only such revel in open day. Compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a> note.<p>Spots they are and blemishes - That is, they are like a dark spot on a pure garment, or like a deformity on an otherwise beautiful person. They are a scandal and disgrace to the Christian profession.<p>Sporting themselves - The Greek word here means to live delicately or luxuriously; to revel. The idea is not exactly that of sporting, or playing, or amusing themselves; but it is that they take advantage of their views to live in riot and luxury. Under the garb of the Christian profession, they give indulgence to the most corrupt passions.<p>With their own deceivings - Jude, in the parallel place, Jde 1:12, has, "These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you." Several versions, and a few manuscripts also, here read "feasts" instead of "deceivings," (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  agapais for &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  apatais.) The common reading, however, is undoubtedly the correct one, (see Wetstein, in loc.); and the meaning is, that they took advantage of their false views to turn even the sacred feasts of charity, or perhaps the Lord's Supper itself, into an occasion of sensual indulgence. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20-22</a>. The difference between these persons, and those in the church at Corinth, seems to have been that these did it at design, and for the purpose of leading others into sin; those who were in the church at Corinth erred through ignorance.<p>While they feast with you - &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  suneuo&#772;choumenoi. This word means to feast several together; to feast with anyone; and the reference seems to be to some festival which was celebrated by Christians, where men and women were assembled together, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>, and where they could convert the festival into a scene of riot and disorder. If the Lord's Supper was celebrated by them as it was at Corinth, that would furnish such an occasion; or if it was preceded by a "feast of charity" (notes, Jde 1:12), that would furnish such an occasion. It would seem to be probable that a festival of some kind was connected with the observance of the Lord's Supper (notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>), and that this was converted by these persons into a scene of riot and disorder. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. receive&#8212;"shall carry off as their due."<p>reward of&#8212;that is, for their "unrighteousness" [Alford].

"Wages of unrighteousness" (2Pe 2:15) has a different sense, namely, the earthly gain to be gotten by "unrighteousness."<p>in the daytime&#8212;Translate as Greek, "counting the luxury which is in the daytime (not restricted to night, as ordinary revelling. Or as Vulgate and Calvin, "the luxury which is but for a day": so Heb 11:25, "the pleasures of sin for a season"; and Heb 12:16, Esau) to be pleasure," that is, to be their chief good and highest enjoyment.<p>Spots&#8212;in themselves.<p>blemishes&#8212;disgraces: bringing blame (so the Greek) on the Church and on Christianity itself.<p>sporting themselves&#8212;Greek, "luxuriating."<p>with&#8212;Greek, "in."<p>deceivings&#8212;or else passively, "deceits": luxuries gotten by deceit. Compare Mt 13:22, "Deceitfulness of riches"; Eph 4:22, "Deceitful lusts." While deceiving others, they are deceived themselves. Compare with English Version, Php 3:19, "Whose glory is in their shame." "Their own" stands in opposition to "you": "While partaking of the love-feast (compare Jude 12) with you," they are at the same time "luxuriating in their own deceivings," or "deceits" (to which latter clause answers Jude 12, end: Peter presents the positive side, "they luxuriate in their own deceivings"; Jude, the negative, "feeding themselves without fear"). But several of the oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, Syriac, and Sahidic Versions read (as Jude), "In their own love-feasts": "their own" will then imply that they pervert the love-feasts so as to make them subserve their own self-indulgent purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness:</span> under this general term, all the several sins they are charged with are comprehended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time; </span> this is said to aggravate their sin, and signifies either their impudence in it, that they had cast off all shame, and practised their luxury by day light, whereas ordinary sinners are wont to choose the night for such works of darkness, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a>,13 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm" title="For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a></span>; or their security, that they spent the day of their life in their pleasures, placing their happiness in present enjoyments, unmindful of a future reckoning and an eternal state. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Spots they are and blemishes; </span> not only altogether polluted themselves, but such as defile others, and are blemishes to the church whereof they profess themselves members. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sporting themselves with their own deceivings:</span> some read agapaiv instead of apataiv, leaving out the pronoun, rendered <span class="ital">their own; </span> and understand this of the love feasts, in which they luxuriously gorged themselves.

Tiseh. 8, on the other hand, says: <span class="greekheb">ἀδικούμενοι</span>, si aptum sensum praebere judicabitur, omnino praeferendum erit. Nescio an “decepti circa <span class="greekheb">μισθὸν ἀδικίας</span>” verti liceat.

This playing upon words is characteristic of 2 Peter, <span class="greekheb">ἀδικεῖν</span> has usually the sense of “doing harm to” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-10.htm" title="Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as you very well know.">Acts 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-12.htm" title="Brothers, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as you are: you have not injured me at all.">Galatians 4:12</a>). Here it would seem to mean “being defrauded of the wages of fraud,” or “being done out of the wages of wrong-doing”. It has been customary to see in this phrase an illustration of the irresponsible use of words in 2 Peter. “Another example of the author’s love of far-fetched and artificial expressions” (Mayor). In P. Eleph., however 27a24/ (iii. B.C.), the writers ask for a receipt with reference to a certain business transaction. <span class="greekheb">τούτου δὲ γενομένου ἐσόμεθα οὐκ ἠδικημένοι</span> “this having been arranged, we shall not be defrauded”. To this may be added Mayor’s citation of Plut.

It has been urged against this that the Greek word for “riot” means rather the delicate and luxurious living (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-25.htm" title="But what went you out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.">Luke 7:25</a>) that might be practised both by day and night rather than actual riot, but it is obvious that luxury shews itself chiefly in banquets which belong to night, and to carry the same luxury into the morning meal might well be noted as indicating excess. In the Greek version by Symmachus a cognate noun is applied to the banqueters of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-7.htm" title="Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.">Amos 6:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Spots they are and blemishes</span>] The former word is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>; the latter is not found elsewhere in the New Testament.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you</span>] The MSS. both here and in the parallel passage of Jude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2 Peter 2:12</a>) vary between <span class="greekheb">ἀπάταις</span> (= <span class="ital">deceits</span>) and <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπαις</span> (= <span class="ital">feasts of love</span>). The latter gives, on the whole, a preferable meaning, and, even if we adopt the former reading, we are compelled by the context to look on the love-feasts as the scene of the sin referred to. The <span class="ital">Agapae</span> were a kind of social club feast, at first, perhaps, connected in time and place with the Lord’s Supper, but afterwards first distinguished and then divided from it. They were a witness of the new brotherhood in which the conventional distinctions of society were suspended, and rich and poor met together. Their existence is recognised in early ecclesiastical writers, in the first century by Ignatius (<span class="ital">ad Smyrn</span>. c. 2), in the second by Tertullian (<span class="ital">Apol</span>. c. 39), and they survived for three or four hundred years, till the disorders connected with them led to their discontinuance. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1 Corinthians 11:21</a> we have traces of such disorders at a very early period, and St Peter’s language here shews that they had found their way into the Asiatic Churches as well as into that of Corinth. The “false teachers” and their followers took their place in the company of the faithful, and instead of being content with their simple food, consisting probably of bread, fish, and vegetables (the fish are always prominent in the representations of the <span class="ital">Agapae</span> in the Catacombs of Rome), brought with them, it would seem, the materials for a more luxurious meal (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>), and, as the context shews, abused the opportunities thus given them for wanton glances and impure dalliance. Taking the first reading (“deceits”), the Apostle lays stress on the fact that in doing so they were in fact practising a fraud on the Christian society into which they thus intruded themselves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time.

This reading is adopted by the Revised Version in the translation, "suffering wrong as the hire of wrongdoing." But the other reading is well supported, and gives a better sense, "receiving, as they shall, the reward of unrighteousness." Balaam loved the reward of unrighteousness in this world (verse 15); the false teachers shall receive its final reward in the world to come. Whichever reading is preferred, this clause is best taken with the preceding verse. As they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime; literally, <span class="accented">counting the revel in daytime a pleasure.</span> St. Peter has hitherto spoken of the insubordination and irreverence of the false teachers; he now goes on to condemn their sensuality. The words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> cannot, with some ancient interpreters, be taken as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, daily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>). Many commentators, as Huther and Alford, translate "delicate living for a day" - enjoyment which is temporal and short-lived. But when we compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>, "They that are drunken are drunken in the night," and St. Peter's own words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>, it seems more probable that the apostle means to describe these false teachers as worse than ordinary men of pleasure. They reserve the night for their feasting; these men spend the day in luxury. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> means "luxurious or delicate living" rather than "riot." Spots they are and blemishes. (For <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, spots, St. Jude has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, sunken rocks.) The word for <span class="accented">"blemishes"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. But comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, where the Lord Jesus is described as "a Lamb without blemish and without spot (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." The Church should be like her Lord, "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>); but these men are spots and blemishes on her beauty. <span class="cmt_word">Sporting themselves with their own deceivings;</span> literally, <span class="accented">reveling in their deceivings.</span> The word for "reveling" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, used just above. The manuscripts vary between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, deceivings, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, loves, love-feasts. The former reading seems the best-supported  here, and the latter in the parallel passage of St. Jude (verse 12). It is possible that the paronomasia may be intentional (compare the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of St. Peter and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Jude). St. Peter will not use the honourable name for the banquets which these men disgrace by their excesses. He calls them <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> - deceits, not love-feasts. There is no love in the hearts of these men. Their love-feasts are hypocrisies, deceits; they try to deceive men, but they deceive not God. <span class="cmt_word">While they feast with you.</span> The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm">Jude 1:12</a>. The false teachers joined in the love-feasts, but made them the occasion of self-indulgence.

It also has in classical Greek the general sense of reward, and so very often in the New Testament, in passages where hire or wages would be inappropriate. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a>. Hire would seem to be better here, because of the reference to Balaam in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>, where the word occurs again and requires that rendering. The phrase &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, reward of wages of iniquity, occurs only here and in Peter's speech concerning Judas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18</a>), where the Rev. retains the rendering of the A. V., reward of iniquity. It would have been better to render wages of iniquity in both places. Iniquity and unrighteousness are used in English almost synonymously; though etymologically, iniquity emphasizes the idea of injustice (inaequus), while unrighteousness (non-rightness) is more general, implying all deviation from right, whether involving another's interests or not. This distinction is not, however, observed in the Rev., where the rendering of &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, and of the kindred adjective &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, varies unaccountably, if not capriciously, between unrighteous and unjust.<p>As they that count it pleasure to riot (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>The as of the A.

The discourse proceeds from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a> by a series of participles, as far as following (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>). Literally the passage runs, counting riot a pleasure.<p>Riot (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>Meaning rather daintiness, delicacy, luxuriousness. Even the Rev. revel is almost too strong. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-25.htm">Luke 7:25</a>, the only other passage where the word occurs, and where the Rev. retains the A. V., live delicately. So, also, Rev. substitutes, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-5.htm">James 5:5</a>, lived delicately for lived in pleasure.<p>In the daytime<p>Compare Peter's words <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>; also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>.<p>Spots (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>. Compare the kindred participle spotted (Jde 1:23), and defileth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>).<p>Blemishes (&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here in New Testament. The negatives of the two terms spots and blemishes occur at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>.<p>continued...</body></html>
