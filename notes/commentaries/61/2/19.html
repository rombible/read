The doctrines of Simon Magus, as reported by Irenæus (I., chap. xxiii. 3) and by Hippolytus (<span class= "ital">Refut.</span> VI., chap. xiv.), show us the kind of liberty that such teachers promised—being “freed from righteousness” to become “the slaves of sin.”<p><span class= "bld">Servants of corruption.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">bond-servants, </span>or <span class= "ital">slaves of corruption.</span> Our translators have often done well in translating the Greek word for “slave” by “servant” (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>), but here the full force of the ignominious term should be given. Tyndale, Cranmer, and Geneva have “bond-servants;” Rheims “slaves.” (Comp. “bondage of corruption,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Brought in bondage.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">enslaved.</span> We seem here to have an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.">John 8:34</a> (see Notes there): “Every one who continues to commit sin is the slave of sin,” words which St. Peter may have heard.

As clouds hinder the light of the sun, so do these darken counsel by words wherein there is no truth. Seeing that these men increase darkness in this world, it is very just that the mist ofdarkness should be their portion in the next. In the midst of their talk of liberty, these men are the vilest slaves; their own lusts gain a complete victory over them, and they are actually in bondage. When men are entangled, they are easily overcome; therefore Christians should keep close to the word of God, and watch against all who seek to bewilder them. A state of apostacy is worse than a state of ignorance. To bring an evil report upon the good way of God, and a false charge against the way of truth, must expose to the heaviest condemnation. How dreadful is the state here described! Yet though such a case is deplorable, it is not utterly hopeless; the leper may be made clean, and even the dead may be raised.

These passions and appetites have obtained the entire mastery over them, and brought them into the severest bondage. This is often the case with those who deride the restraints of serious piety. They are themselves the slaves of appetite, or of the rules of fashionable life, or of the laws of honor, or of vicious indulgences.

These false teachers, that talked so much of Christian liberty, yet being overcome by their own lusts, and kept under by them, were the worst of slaves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_peter/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>While they promise them liberty,.... Not Christian liberty, which lies in a freedom from sin, its dominion, guilt, and condemnation, and in serving God with liberty, cheerfulness, and without fear; but a sinful carnal liberty, a liberty from the law of God, from obedience to it as a rule of walk and conversation, and from the laws of men, from subjection to the civil magistrate, and from servitude to masters, and obedience to parents; a liberty to lay aside and neglect the ordinances of the Gospel at pleasure, and to live in all manner of sin and wickedness; a liberty which is contrary to the nature, will, and work of Christ, to his Spirit, and to the principle of grace in the heart, and to the Gospel, and to the conduct and conversation of real saints. Now this was the snare by which the false teachers beguiled unstable souls; liberty being what is greatly desirable to men, and is suited to their carnal lusts and interests: but a vain promise was this, when <p>they themselves are the servants of corruption; of sin, which has corrupted all mankind in soul and body; and particularly the lust of uncleanness, which these men walked in, and by which they not only corrupted themselves, but the good manners of others also; and which tended and led them both to ruin and destruction, signified by the pit of corruption: and yet these very preachers, that promised liberty to others, were the servants of sin; they were under the power and government of sin. They were not only born so, and were homeborn slaves to sin, but they sold themselves to work wickedness; voluntarily and with delight, they served divers lusts and pleasures, and were slaves and drudges thereunto; as likewise to Satan, whose lusts they would do, and by whom they were led captive; so that their condition was mean, base, and deplorable, and therefore could never make good their promise, or give that which they had not themselves: and which is confirmed by the following reasoning, <p>for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage: as this is a certain point in war, that when one man is conquered by another, he is no longer a free man, but the other's prisoner and captive, and is in a state of servitude and bondage; so it is when a man is overcome by sin, which must be understood not of a partial victory or conquest, for a good man may be surprised by sin, and overtaken in a fault, and be overcome and carried captive by it for a time, as was the apostle, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a>; and yet not be a servant of corruption, or properly in a state of bondage to it; but this is to be understood of a total and complete victory, when a man is wholly under the dominion of sin, it reigns in his mortal body, and he obeys it in the lusts of it, and yields his members instruments of unrighteousness; such a man is neither a free man himself, nor can he much less promise and give liberty to others. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_peter/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_peter/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-19.htm" title="While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.">2 Peter 2:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐλευθερίαν αὐτοῖς ἐπαγγελλόμενοι</span>] Explanation of the <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρογκα ματ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φθεγγόμενοι</span>; the high speeches have as their contents the praise of liberty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελλόμενοι</span>; they assure, promise, those who submit to their guidance that they will conduct them to true liberty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ δοῦλοι ὑπάρχοντες τῆς φθορᾶς</span>] A sharp antithesis to <span class="greekheb">ἐλευθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελλ</span>.: “<span class="ital">though they themselves are slaves of</span> <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span>.” By <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> moral corruption is generally understood, but elsewhere in the N.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a> it denotes the opposite of <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, which Hofmann wrongly denies. Schott erroneously takes it to mean “the things of sense;” but these, though they be given up to <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span>, yet cannot be directly defined as <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> itself.[80] The chief emphasis lies on <span class="greekheb">δοῦλοι</span>. The general statement: <span class="greekheb">ᾧ γάρ τις ἥττηται</span>, <span class="greekheb">τούτῳ καὶ δεδούλωται</span>, serves to show that the term is applied to them not without justification. The verb <span class="greekheb">ἡττᾶσθαι</span> (with the exception of in this passage and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm" title="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.">2 Peter 2:20</a>, to be found only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>) is in classical Greek often used as a passive and construed with <span class="greekheb">ὑπό</span>, and, in harmony with its meaning, frequently with the genitive, and sometimes also with the dative. The latter is the case here: “<span class="ital">to whom any one succumbs</span>.” The dat. with <span class="greekheb">δεδούλωται</span> expresses the relation of belonging to: <span class="ital">to him he is made the slave, i.e.</span> whose slave he is. Schott arbitrarily asserts that <span class="greekheb">ἥττηται</span> with the dat. brings out that the being overcome “is voluntary and desired on principle.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[80] Hofmann, appealing to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>, understands <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> here also as meaning “the corruptible;” but in that passage the context itself proves that the abstract idea is put in place of the concrete, which is not the case here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_peter/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-19.htm" title="While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.">2 Peter 2:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐλευθερίαν</span>. Doubtless that Antinomianism is indicated to which the doctrine of Grace has ever been open. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13</a>. It arises from the ever-recurring confusion of liberty and license. The training of conscience is contemporaneous with the growth of Christian character. The Pauline teaching, which abrogated external legality, was open to abuse, and might easily be dangerous to recent converts from heathenism. <span class="greekheb">φθορᾶς</span>. See Mayor’s note, ed. p. 175. <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> is that gradual decay of spiritual and moral sense that follows on wilful self-indulgence. <span class="greekheb">ᾧγάρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">διδούλωται</span>. <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?">Romans 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.">John 8:34</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_peter/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption</span>] We have here the characteristic feature of the teaching which St Peter condemns. It offered its followers freedom from the restraints which the Council of Jerusalem had imposed alike on participation in idolatrous feasts and on sins of impurity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.">Acts 15:29</a>). That this was the key-note of their claims we have a distinct indication in St Paul’s teaching on the same subject. His question “Am I not free?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>), his condemnation of those who boasted of their “right” (“liberty” in the English version) to eat things sacrificed to idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>), who proclaimed that all things were “lawful” for them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>), shew that this was the watchword of the party of license at Corinth, and the language of St Peter, though more coloured with the feeling of a burning indignation at the later development of the system, is, in substance, but the echo of that of his brother Apostle. In his contrast between the boast of liberty and the actual bondage to corruption we may trace a reproduction of our Lord’s teaching in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.">John 8:34</a>, of St Paul’s in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?">Romans 6:16</a>. The word for “they are the servants” (literally, <span class="bld">being the servants</span>) implies that this had been all along their settled, continuous state. The very phrase <span class="bld">bond-slaves of corruption</span> seems to reproduce <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of whom a man is overcome</span> …] The Greek leaves it uncertain whether the pronouns refer to a person, or to a more abstract power—<span class="bld">wherein a man is overcome, to that he is enslaved</span>. On the whole the latter seems preferable. Here again we have an echo of St Paul’s language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?">Romans 6:16</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-19.htm" title="While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.">2 Peter 2:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐλευθερίαν</span>, <span class="ital">liberty</span>) so as neither to he afraid of the devil, nor to loathe the flesh.—<span class="greekheb">ᾧ γάρ τις ἥττηται</span>) <span class="ital">for he by whom any one has permitted himself to be overcome, and has yielded himself vanquished</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τούτῳ καὶ δεδούλωται</span>, <span class="ital">by him also is he held in bondage</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-9.htm" title="If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall you be our servants, and serve us.">1 Samuel 17:9</a>.

Liberty was the subject of their great swelling words of vanity; they talked loudly, made a great boast, about liberty. Perhaps they were wresting to their own destruction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15, 16</a>) the teaching of St. Paul concerning Christian liberty. St. Paul had spoken of the liberty of the glory of the children of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>); he had again and again asserted the liberty of Christians in things indifferent (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>, etc.). But he had insisted on the paramount duty of giving no offence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>, etc.), and had earnestly cautioned his converts to "use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh." There were false teachers who maintained that the true Gnostic was free from moral restraints, in fact, that liberty meant libertinism, liberty to sin (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>). They themselves are the servants of corruption. The construction is still participial, "being" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) being from the beginning servants of corruption. Those who talked about liberty were themselves all the time the bondservants, the slaves, of corruption. The  word rendered "corruption" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) <span class="accented">in</span>cludes the sense of" destruction," as in verse 12 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</span> "Of whom," or "by whatever;" by Satan, the personal tempter, or by sin, the innate tendency; the Greek word will bear either meaning. Some good manuscripts add "also," which strengthens the assertion; "is he also brought in bondage." St. Peter's teaching corresponds exactly with that of St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>. There is a very close parallel to this clause in the 'Clementine Recognitions' (5:12; quoted by Dr. Salmon, in his 'Historical Introduction to the Books of the New Testament'): "unusquisque illius fit servus cui se ipse subjecerit." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_peter/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Is overcome (&#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., is worsted; from &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, inferior.
