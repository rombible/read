See the margin. <span class="ital">But it has happened unto them according to the true proverb </span>— The ancients used to sum up their wisest and most useful observations in short, nervous, and impressive proverbs, which were more easily understood, and better remembered, than long, laboured discourses. <span class="ital">The dog, the sow — </span>Unclean creatures: such are all men in the sight of God before they receive his grace, and after they have made shipwreck of the faith. These proverbs teach us the absolute necessity of constant watchfulness and prayer, self- denial and mortification, in order to our persevering in the way of righteousness after we have entered upon it. And, as some think, they teach also that many, if not most of those who relapse into their former habits of sin, had contented themselves with a mere external reformation, and had stopped short of a thorough change of nature, or being made new creatures in Christ Jesus. It may be worth observing, that the former of these proverbs is found <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-11.htm" title="As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.">Proverbs 26:11</a>, and the latter is said to have been a common proverb among the ancients: see <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/26-24.htm" title="A dishonest woman contemneth shame: but an honest woman will reverence her husband....">Sir 26:24-26</a>. Horace has a plain reference to both of them, lib. 1. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/26-26.htm" title="A woman that honoureth her husband shall be judged wise of all; but she that dishonoureth him in her pride shall be counted ungodly of all.">Sir 26:26</a>, where he is speaking of the travels of Ulysses, and says, “If he had been conquered by the charms of Circe, he had lived like an impure dog, or a sow that is fond of the mire.” Surely these proverbs will not be thought coarse or unpolite in St. Peter, when some of the most elegant writers of antiquity have made use of, or referred to them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:17-22 The word of truth is the water of life, which refreshes the souls that receive it; but deceivers spread and promote error, and are set forth as empty, because there is no truth in them. As clouds hinder the light of the sun, so do these darken counsel by words wherein there is no truth. Seeing that these men increase darkness in this world, it is very just that the mist ofdarkness should be their portion in the next. In the midst of their talk of liberty, these men are the vilest slaves; their own lusts gain a complete victory over them, and they are actually in bondage. When men are entangled, they are easily overcome; therefore Christians should keep close to the word of God, and watch against all who seek to bewilder them. A state of apostacy is worse than a state of ignorance. To bring an evil report upon the good way of God, and a false charge against the way of truth, must expose to the heaviest condemnation. How dreadful is the state here described! Yet though such a case is deplorable, it is not utterly hopeless; the leper may be made clean, and even the dead may be raised.

People may outwardly reform, and escape from the open corruptions which prevail around them, or which they had themselves practiced, and still have no true grace at heart.<p>Through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesses Christ - Neither does This imply that they were true Christians, or that they had ever had any saving knowledge of the Redeemer. There is a knowledge of the doctrines and duties of religion which may lead sinners to abandon their outward vices, which has no connection with saving grace. They may profess religion, and may Know enough of religion to understand that it requires them to abandon their vicious habits, and still never be true Christians.<p>They are again entangled therein and overcome - The word rendered "entangled," (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;  empleko&#772;,) from which is derived our word "implicate," means to braid in, to interweave; then to involve in, to entangle. It means here that they become implicated in those vices like an animal that is entangled in a net.<p>The latter end is worse with them than the beginning - This is usually the case. Apostates become worse than they were before their professed conversion. "Reformed" drunkards, if they go back to their "cups" again, become more abandoned than ever. Thus, it is with those who have been addicted to any habits of vice, and who profess to become religious, and then fall away. The "reasons" for this may be:<p>(1) that they are willing now to show to others that they are no longer under the restraints by which they had professedly bound themselves;<p>(2) that God gives them up to indulgence with fewer restraints than formerly; and,<p>(3) their old companions in sin may be at special pains to court their society, and to lead them into temptation, in order to obtain a triumph over virtue and religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. after they&#8212;the seducers "themselves" have escaped (2Pe 2:19; see on [2634]Heb 6:4-6).<p>pollutions&#8212;which bring "corruption" (2Pe 2:19).<p>through&#8212;Greek, "in."<p>knowledge&#8212;Greek, "full and accurate knowledge."<p>the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&#8212;solemnly expressing in full the great and gracious One from whom they fall.<p>latter end is worse &#8230; than the beginning&#8212;Peter remembers Christ's words.

The sins of it, the governing vices of it, which the men of the world are addicted to, and immersed in; for the whole world lies in wickedness, and which are of a defiling nature: the phrase is Rabbinical; it is said (q), <p>"he that studies not in the law in this world, but is defiled , "with the pollutions of the world", what is written of him? and they took him, and cast him without:'' <p>these, men may escape, abstain from, and outwardly reform, with respect unto, and yet be destitute of the grace of God; so that this can be no instance of the final and total apostasy of real saints; for the house may be swept and garnished with an external reformation; persons may be outwardly righteous before men, have a form of godliness and a name to live, and yet be dead in trespasses and sins; all which they may have <p>through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, read, our Lord, and the latter leave out, "and Saviour"; by which "knowledge" is meant, not a spiritual experimental knowledge of Christ, for that is eternal life, the beginning, pledge, and earnest of it; but a notional knowledge of Christ, or a profession of knowledge of him, for it may be rendered "acknowledgment"; or rather the Gospel of Christ, which, being only notionally received, may have such an effect on men, as outwardly to reform their lives, at least in some instances, and for a while, in whose hearts it has no place. Now if, after all this knowledge and reformation, <p>they are again entangled therein; in the pollutions of the world, in worldly lusts, which are as gins, pits and snares: <p>and overcome; by them, so as to be laden with them, and led away, and entirely governed and influenced by them: <p>the latter end, or state, <p>is worse with them than the beginning; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a>. Their beginning, or first estate, was that in which they were born, a state of darkness, ignorance, and sin, and in which they were brought up, and was either the state of Judaism, or of Gentilism; their next estate was an outward deliverance and escape from the error of the one, or of the other, and an embracing and professing the truth of the Christian religion, joined with a becoming external conversation; and this their last estate was an apostasy from the truth of the Gospel they had professed, a reception of error and heresy, and a relapse into sin and immorality, which made their case worse than it was at first; for, generally, such persons are more extravagant in sinning; are like raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; and are seldom, or ever, recovered; and by their light, knowledge, and profession, their punishment will be more aggravated, and become intolerable. <p>(q) Zohar in Gen. fol. 104. 3.

Bengel, Fronmüller, Hofmann are of a different opinion. They assume that <span class="greekheb">ἀποφυγόντες</span> refers to those who are led astray, and that the latter accordingly, and not the seducers, are to be regarded as the subject of the clause. In favour of this view may be urged the term <span class="greekheb">ἀποφυγόντες</span>, which seems to refer back to the <span class="greekheb">ἀποφευγόντας</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2 Peter 2:18</a>.

The false teachers had not been all along hypocrites and pretenders. They had once in the fullest sense of the words “known Christ” as their Lord and Saviour. There is, perhaps, no single passage in the whole extent of New Testament teaching more crucial than this in its bearing on the Calvinistic dogma of the indefectibility of grace.

Is St. Peter in this verse still speaking of the false teachers, or of those whom they had enticed (verse 18)? Bengel, Fronmuller, and others take the latter view, thinking that the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("those having escaped") of this verse must be the same with the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ("those who are escaping," or "those having escaped") of verse 18. But it is far more natural to understand St, Peter as continuing his description of the false teachers. The conjunction "for" connects the clause closely with that immediately preceding, and suggests that St. Peter is explaining the term "bondservants or slaves" applied to the false teachers in verse 19; the repetition of the word "overcome" also seems to imply that the subjects of yore. 20 and 19 are the same. The word for" pollutions" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs only here. In 'Hermas' (Vis., 4:3, 2) there occurs what may be a reminiscence of this verse: "Ye who have escaped this world." Through the knowledge of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> and Saviour Jesus Christ. Several of the most ancient manuscripts read, "our Lord and Saviour." The word rendered "knowledge" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, full knowledge (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-2.htm">2 Peter 1:2, 3, 8</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). The preposition is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>. The full, personal knowledge of the Saviour is the sphere in which the Christian lives; while he abides in that knowledge grace and peace are multiplied unto him, and he is enabled to escape the pollutions of the world. The apostle warns us here that some of those who once enjoyed the blessedness of that sacred knowledge have been entangled in sin and have fallen from grace. They are again entangled therein, and overcome. The first clause is participial; the connection seems to be, "If, having escaped...  but being again entangled they are overcome." The word "entangled" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) suggests the figure of fishes entangled in the meshes of a net, and seems to point back to the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("entice") of verses 18 and 14; they entice others, but they are entangled themselves (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-4.htm">2 Timothy 2:4</a>), and become captives and slaves to the pollutions of the world from which they had once escaped. The latter end is worse with them than the beginning; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the last state is become worse with them than the first.</span> This is a distinct quotation of our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-26.htm">Luke 11:26</a>. The evil spirit had been cast out from these men; for a time they had lived in the full knowledge of Christ; but now the evil spirit had returned, and had brought with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself. This spontaneous adoption of our Lord's words without marks of quotation is not like the work of a forger. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_peter/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Pollutions (&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
