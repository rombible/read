Here parallels with Jude begin again. In the historical incident of Balaam, as in that of Sodom and Gomorrha, our Epistle is more detailed than Jude (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm" title="And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:">2Peter 2:7</a>). The past tenses in this verse are quite in harmony with the view that this chapter is a genuine prediction. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm" title="Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?">Genesis 49:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-15.htm" title="And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.">Genesis 49:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/49-23.htm" title="The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:">Genesis 49:23-24</a>.) The future foretold with such confidence as to be spoken of as already past is a common form for prophecy to assume.<p><span class= "bld">Balaam the son of Bosor</span>.—Bosor seems to be a dialectical variation from Beor, arising out of peculiar Aramaic pronunciation—a slight indication that the writer was a Jew of Palestine. The resemblance between these false teachers and Balaam consisted in their running counter to God’s will for their own profit, and in prostituting their office to an infamous purpose, which brought ruin on the community. He, like they, had “enticed unstable souls,” and had “a heart exercised in covetousness.” A comparison of this passage with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14-15</a>, gives countenance to the view that among the false teachers thus stigmatised the Nicolaitans may be included. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-11.htm" title="Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.">Jude 1:11</a>, these ungodly men are compared not only to Balaam, but also to Cain and Korah. It seems more likely that St. Jude should add these two very opprobrious comparisons than that the vehement writer of this Epistle should reject material so suitable to his invective. If so, we have here another argument for the priority of our Epistle. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2Peter 2:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_peter/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2 Peter 2:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Which have forsaken the right </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ευθειαν</span>, <span class="ital">straight; way </span>— The way of truth and integrity, <span class="ital">and are gone astray </span>— Have wandered in dangerous and destructive paths; <span class="ital">following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor </span>— (So the Chaldeans pronounced what the Jews called <span class="ital">Beor,</span>) namely, the ways of covetousness. Balaam loved wealth and honour so much, that to obtain them he acted contrary to his conscience. To follow his way, therefore, is to be guided by similar base passions, and to commit similar base actions; <span class="ital">who loved the wages of unrighteousness </span>— “When Balaam was first sent for to curse the Israelites, Balak’s messengers carried only the rewards of divination in their hands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-7.htm" title="And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.">Numbers 22:7</a> : and therefore when God forbade him to go, he easily acquiesced, and refused to go, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time.

But when Balak sent a second request by more honourable messengers, and with them a promise to promote him to very great honour, and to do whatever he should say to him, Balaam, inflamed with the love of the promised hire, endeavoured a second time to obtain permission to go. And though God allowed him to go, on the express condition that he should do nothing in the affair without his order, Balaam went with the resolution of cursing the Israelites, whether God permitted him or not;” as evidently appears from the circumstances of the story, to which the reader is referred. “And though he so far obeyed God that he blessed the Israelites, it was no dictate of his heart, but a suggestion of the Spirit of God, which he could not resist. For that his love of the hire, and his inclination to curse the Israelites continued, he showed by his behaviour afterward, when, to bring the curse of God upon the Israelites, he counselled Balak to entice them to fornication and idolatry by means of the Midianitish women, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm" title="Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.">Numbers 31:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a> :” in giving which advice he acted most unrighteously, knowing it to be evil, and that God’s purpose concerning the Israelites was irrevocable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm" title="God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?">Numbers 23:19</a>, &c. “He therefore gave the advice, not in the persuasion that it would be effectual, but merely to gain the promised hire, which therefore is called the hire of unrighteousness. In these things the false teachers, who, to draw money from their disciples, encouraged them by their doctrine to commit all manner of lewdness, might well be said to <span class="ital">follow in the way of Baalam; </span>and their doctrine might justly be called, <span class="ital">the doctrine of Balaam.” </span>— Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up to their own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it.

Religion is often represented as a straight path, and to do wrong is to go out of that path in a crooked way.<p>Following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5</a>, following. In the Book of Numbers, Balaam is called the son of "Beor." Perhaps the name Beor was corrupted into Bosor; or, as Rosenmuller suggests, the father of Balaam may have had two names. Schleusner (Lexicon) supposes that it was changed by the Greeks because it was more easily pronounced. The Septuagint, however, reads it as &#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c1;  Beo&#772;r - "Beor." The meaning here is, that they IMitAted Balaam. The particular point to which Peter refers in which they imitated him, seems to have been the love of gain, or covetousness. Possibly, however, he might have designed to refer to a more general resemblance, for in fact they imitated him in the following things:<p>(1) in being professed religious teachers, or the servants of God;<p>(2) in their covetousness;<p>(3) in inducing others to sin, referring to the same kind of sins in both cases.<p>Balaam counselled the Moabites to entice the children of Israel to illicit connection with their women, thus introducing licentiousness into the camp of the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-9</a>); and in like manner these teachers led others into licentiousness, thus corrupting the church.<p>Who loved the wages of unrighteousness - Who was supremely influenced by the love of gain, and was capable of being employed, for a price, in a wicked design; thus prostituting his high office, as a professed prophet of the Most High, to base and ignoble ends. That Balaam, though he professed to be influenced by a supreme regard to the will of God <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-38.htm">Numbers 22:38</a>, was really influenced by the desire of reward, and was willing to prostitute his great office to secure such a reward, there can be no doubt.<p>(1) the elders of Moab and of Midian came to Balaam with "the rewards of divination in their hand" <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7</a>, and with promises from Balak of promoting him to great honor, if he would curse the children of Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-17.htm">Numbers 22:17</a>.<p>(2) Balaam was disposed to go with them, and was restrained from going at once only by a direct and solemn prohibition from the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-11.htm">Numbers 22:11</a>.<p>(3) notwithstanding this solemn prohibition, and not with standing he said to the ambassadors from Balak that he would do only as God directed, though Balak should give him his house full of silver and gold, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>, yet he did not regard the matter as settled, but proposed to them that they should wait another night, with the hope that the Lord would give a more favourable direction in reference to their request, thus showing that his heart was in the service which they required, and that his inclination was to avail himself of their offer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-19.htm">Numbers 22:19</a>.<p>(4) when he did obtain permission to go, it was only to say that which the Lord should direct him to say, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-20.htm">Numbers 22:20</a>; but he went with a perverse heart, with a secret wish to comply with the desire of Balak, and with a knowledge that he was doing wrong, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-34.htm">Numbers 22:34</a>, and was restrained from uttering the curse which Balak desired only by an influence from above which he could not control. Balaam was undoubtedly a wicked man, and was constrained by a power from on high to utter sentiments which God meant should be uttered, but which Balaam would never have expressed of his own accord. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. have&#8212;Some of the seducers are spoken of as already come, others as yet to come.<p>following&#8212;out: so the Greek.<p>the way&#8212;(Nu 22:23, 32; Isa 56:11).<p>son of Bosor&#8212;the same as Beor (Nu 22:5).

The Vulgate Latin version reads "Balaam out of Bosor", taking "Bosor" for the name of a place, of which "Balaam" was; but not "Bosor", but "Pethor", was the place of Balaam's residence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5</a>.

Dietlein presses <span class="greekheb">ἰδίας</span>, by translating: “belonging to him,” and adds by way of explanation: “to him who must be looked upon as the prototype of the false prophets.” Wiesinger, on the other hand, sees the significance of <span class="greekheb">ἰδίας</span> in this, that “he who was a prophet to others, had to suffer rebuke of an ass for his own <span class="greekheb">παρανομ</span>.” But neither the one nor the other is alluded to in the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That which follows states in what the <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξις</span> consisted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑποζύγιον</span>] properly: a beast that bears a yoke, here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-5.htm" title="Tell you the daughter of Sion, Behold, your King comes to you, meek, and sitting on an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.">Matthew 21:5</a>, designation of the ass.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄφωνον</span>] in contrast to human speaking.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀνθρώπο φωνῇ φθεγξάμενον</span>] does not state the reason of the <span class="greekheb">ἐκώλυσε</span>, but emphasizes the miraculous nature of the occurrence (<span class="greekheb">ἄφωνον</span> … <span class="greekheb">φωνῇ</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκώλυσε τὴν τοῦ προφήτου παραφρονίαν</span>] Schott understands Balaam’s <span class="greekheb">παραφρονία</span> to be his striking of the ass; Wiesinger: “his folly, in setting himself against the angel;” but it is more correct to understand by it the aforenamed <span class="greekheb">παρανομία</span>, which the angel opposed. Hofmann rightly observes: “the signification of the verb does not imply that it is left undone, but simply that opposition is offered to what is done or is intended to be done; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>.”[77] The word <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΑΦΡΟΝΊΑ</span></span></span>, “<span class="ital">folly</span>,” <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>.

(See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2 Peter 2:2</a>.) It may be noted that the charge thus brought against the false teachers by St Peter is identical with that which St Paul brings against Elymas of “perverting the right ways of the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>). We may see in the sorcerer of Cyprus, as well as in that of Samaria, a representative instance of the character which both Apostles condemn.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor</span>] The use of the term “way” is probably connected with the stress laid in the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-32.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why have you smitten your ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me:">Numbers 22:32</a> (“Thy <span class="ital">way</span> is perverse before me”), in the journey which Balaam took in spite of the Divine warnings. The form Bosor, instead of Beor, may represent the mode of pronouncing the guttural letter that enters into the Hebrew name (<span class="greekheb">ע</span>) which prevailed in Galilee, analogous to that which in other languages has turned <span class="greekheb">ἐπτὰ</span> into <span class="ital">septem</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὕλη</span> into <span class="ital">sylva</span>, and the like. On this supposition, St Peter’s use of the form presents a coincidence with his betraying himself by his Galilean dialect in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-73.htm" title="And after a while came to him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech denudes you.">Matthew 26:73</a>. The characteristic feature of that dialect was its tendency to soften gutturals. Another explanation, not, however, incompatible with this, has been found in the conjecture that as the Hebrew word <span class="ital">Bashar</span> signifies “flesh,” the Apostle may have used the form of the name which conveyed the thought that Balaam was “a son of the flesh,” carnal and base of purpose. Like explanations have been given of the change of Sychem (= a portion) into Sychar (= a lie) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>), of Beelzebub (= lord of flies) into Beelzebul (= lord of dung) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm" title="It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?">Matthew 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24</a>). If we accept the explanation given by many commentators of the name Nicolaitans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-6.htm" title="But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.">Revelation 2:6</a>) as being a Greek equivalent for Balaamites, there would be reason for thinking that the prominence given to his history at this period of the Apostolic age led men, after the manner of the time, to find even in the syllables of his name a <span class="ital">paronomasia</span> which made it ominous and significant of evil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The prominence just spoken of is traceable not only here and in the parallel passage of Jude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-11.htm" title="Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.">2 Peter 2:11</a>), but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a>, where it appears in close connexion with the practice of eating things sacrificed to idols and the impurity associated with that practice. It has been contended by some writers (Renan, <span class="ital">St Paul</span>, c. x. p. 304) that from the point of view of the three writers who thus refer to Balaam, St Paul, in teaching the essential indifference of the act (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one....">1 Corinthians 8:4-8</a>), appeared to reproduce the errors of the son of Beor. The hypothesis is, however, a singularly untenable one. No teacher could condemn the practice more strongly than St Paul, though he does so on rational and spiritual grounds, and not from the Jewish standpoint of there being an actual physical contamination in the things so sacrificed (1 Corinthians 8-10). It would indeed be much more in accordance with facts to infer that it was St Paul’s allusion to the history of Balaam’s temptation of the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-9.htm" title="And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.">Numbers 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm" title="Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.">Numbers 31:16</a>) that first associated the name of the prophet of Pethor with the corrupt practices of the party of licence in the Apostolic Church, and that St Peter, St Jude, and St John were but following in his track. It is noticeable, lastly, that in the purely Ebionite or Judaizing books, known as the <span class="ital">Clementine Homilies</span> and <span class="ital">Recognitions</span>, there is no reference to the name of Balaam.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who loved the wages of unrighteousness</span>] The phrase is repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2 Peter 2:13</a> as laying stress on this point of parallelism between the earlier and later forms of evil. It is not without interest to note that in both the Apostle reproduces what we find recorded as spoken by him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-18.htm" title="Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.">Acts 1:18</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2 Peter 2:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐξακολουθήσαντες τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ Βαλαὰμ</span>, <span class="ital">following the way of Balaam</span>) See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm" title="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Judges 1:8</a>, from Isaiah 56—<span class="greekheb">Βοσὸρ</span>, <span class="ital">Bosor</span>) This and <span class="ital">Beor</span> are synonyms.

Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-32.htm">Numbers 22:32</a>, where the angel of the Lord says of Balaam, "Thy way is perverse before me." The form "Bosor," instead of "Beor," arose probably from a peculiar (perhaps Galilaean) pronunciation of the guttural <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>. Thus we, perhaps, have here an undesigned coincidence, a slight confirmation of St. Peter's authorship: he was a Galilaean, and his speech betrayed him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>); one characteristic of the Galilaean dialect was a mispronunciation of the gutturals. But some commentators see in the resemblance of the form "Bosor" to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, flesh, an allusion to those sins of the flesh into which Balaam allured the Israelites. Compare the Jewish use of such names as <span class="accented">Ishbosheth</span> in derision for <span class="accented">Eshbaal</span> ("the man of shame" for "the man of Baal"), and <span class="accented">Jerubbesheth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>) for <span class="accented">Jerubbaal.</span> The references to Balaam here, in St. Jude, the Book of the Revelation, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>, show that his history had made a great impression on the mind of thoughtful Christians. St. John connects his name with the Nicolaitanes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-15.htm">Revelation 2:15</a>, much as St. Peter here connects it with the false teachers of his time. Some, again, see in the etymology of the word "Nicolaitane" an allusion to that of "Balaam," as if the Nicolaitanes were followers of Balaam. There is another explanation in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the word "Bosor" is an Aramaic form, and that "the form possibly became familiar to St. Peter during his residence at Babylon, and suggests the probability that Aramaic traditions were still current respecting Balaam at the Christian era, and on the banks of the Euphrates" (additional note on Numbers 22:5). But the two oldest manuscripts read "Beer" here. Who loved the wages of unrighteousness (comp. verse 13, and also St. Peter's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18</a>).
