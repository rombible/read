The literary form of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>, is so very superior; the antithesis (quite wanting here) between abusing what they cannot know and misusing what they cannot help knowing is so telling, and would be so easily remembered, that it is improbable that a writer who was willing to adopt so much would not have adopted in this respect also; and whichever writer is second, it is evident that he was willing to adopt his predecessor’s material almost to any extent. On the other hand, there is nothing improbable in a writer who knew this verse improving upon it by writing <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>. The verses, similar as they are in much of their wording, are very different in their general drift. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>, is simply an epigrammatic description of these ungodly men; this verse is a denunciation of final ruin against them.<p><span class= "bld">Made to be taken and destroyed.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">born naturally for capture and destruction. “</span>Natural” comes in better here as a kind of adverb than as an additional epithet to beasts. The force of it is that these animals cannot help themselves—it is their nature to rush after what will prove their ruin; but the false teachers voluntarily seek their own destruction against nature. This verse contains one of the repetitions noticed above (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm" title="And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:">2Peter 2:7</a>) as characteristic of this Epistle. The word for “destruction” and “corruption” is one and the same in the Greek, the destroying being literal in the first case, moral in the second. Moreover, the word for “perish” is from the same root. “Like brutes born for capture and <span class= "ital">destruction, </span>these men shall be <span class= "ital">destroyed</span> in their <span class= "ital">destruction.</span>” But such a translation would be misleading in English.<p><span class= "bld">Shall utterly perish.</span>—A reading of higher authority gives us, <span class= "ital">shall even perish.</span><p><span class= "bld">In their own corruption.</span>—“Own” may be omitted. Their present evil life anticipates and contains within itself the elements of their final destruction. Thus they “bring it upon themselves” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>). The right division of the sentences here cannot be decided with certainty; the Apostle hurries on, in the full flood of his denunciation, without paying much attention to the precise form of his language. On the whole, it seems best to place only a comma at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2Peter 2:12</a>, with a full stop or colon at “unrighteousness,” and to make what follows part of the long sentence, of which the main verb is “are gone astray” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_peter/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;...">2 Peter 2:12-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">But these </span>— False teachers; <span class="ital">as natural brute beasts </span>— As irrational animals, led merely by their brutish inclinations, several of which, in the present disordered state of the world, seem to be <span class="ital">made to be taken and destroyed </span>by mankind.

Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But these, as natural brute beasts - These persons, who resemble so much irrational animals which are made to be taken and destroyed. The point of the comparison is, that they are like fierce and savage beasts that exercise no control over their appetites, and that seeM to be made only to be destroyed. These persons, by their fierce and ungovernable passions, appear to be made only for destruction, and rush blindly on to it. The word rendered "natural," (which, however, is lacking in several manuscripts), means "as they are by nature," following the bent of their natural appetites and passions. The idea is, that they exercised no more restraint over their passions than beasts do over their propensities. They were entirely under the dominion of their natural appetites, and did not allow their reason or conscience to exert any constraint. The word rendered "brute," means without reason; irrational. Man has reason, and should allow it to control his passions; the brutes have no rational nature, and it is to be expected that they will act out their propensities without restraint. Man, as an animal, has many passions and appetites resembling those of the brute creation, but he is also endowed with a higher nature, which is designed to regulate and control his inferior propensities, and to keep them in subordination to the requirements of law. If a man sinks himself to the level of brutes, he must expect to be treated like brutes; and as wild and savage animals - lions, and panthers, and wolves, and bears - are regarded as dangerous, and as "made to be taken and destroyed," so the same destiny must come upon men who make themselves like them.<p>Made to be taken and destroyed - They are not only useless to society, but destructive; and men feel that it is right to destroy them. We are not to suppose that this teaches that the only object which God had in view in making wild animals was that they might be destroyed; but that people so regard them.<p>Speak evil of the things that they understand not - Of objects whose worth and value they cannot appreciate. This is no uncommon thing among people, especially in regard to the works and ways of God.<p>And shall utterly perish in their own corruption - Their views will be the means of their ruin; and they render them fit for it, just as much as the fierce passions of the wild animals do. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The characteristics are still further described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-10.htm" title="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Judges 1:10</a>, but here the punishment is promised to these men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὗτοι δέ</span>] antithesis to <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span>; the predicate belonging to it is <span class="greekheb">φθαρήσονται</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς ἄλογα ζῶα</span> … <span class="greekheb">φθοράν</span>] Parenthetical thought in close relation to <span class="greekheb">φθαρήσονται</span>; Grotius: ita peribunt illi, sicut pereunt muta animantia.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γεγεννημένα φυσικά</span> can hardly be translated: “born as <span class="ital">sensuous</span> beings to,” etc. (Wiesinger, and formerly in this commentary). <span class="greekheb">φυσικά</span> is meant rather to bring out that the irrational animals are, according to their <span class="ital">natural</span> constitution, born to <span class="greekheb">ἅλωσις</span>. Hofmann takes <span class="greekheb">φυσικά</span> as a second attribute added to <span class="greekheb">γεγεννημένα</span> by asyndeton, equal to: “by nature determined to <span class="greekheb">ἅλωσις</span>,” etc. But the only objection to this is that <span class="greekheb">γεγεννημένα</span> alone cannot well be considered as a special attribute. As regards the sense, it makes no difference whether <span class="greekheb">φυσικά</span> be placed before (<span class="ital">Rec.</span>) or after <span class="greekheb">γεγενν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς ἅλωσιν καὶ φθοράν</span>] According to Luther, a twofold rendering is possible: “First, those who take and strangle; second, who are to be taken, strangled, and slaughtered;” the latter is the only correct interpretation. The general interpretation is, “for taking and destroying;” Schott on the other hand translates, “for taking and <span class="ital">consuming</span>; “and Hofmann, in like manner, who holds that both are active ideas, “that they may be taken and <span class="ital">consumed</span>.” This interpretation of <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span>, however, is arbitrary, and all the more unwarranted, that in the subsequent <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ φθορᾷ αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> cannot have this special meaning. According to N. T. usage, what is meant by <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> here is the destruction to which the beasts are destined; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-22.htm" title=" Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?">Colossians 2:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς ἀγνοοῦσιν βλασφημοῦντες</span> … <span class="greekheb">φθαρήσονται</span> With regard to the construction, cf. “Winer, p. 583 [E. T. 784]. According to the usual interpretation, <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς</span> is dependent on <span class="greekheb">βλασφημοῦντες</span>, and is to be resolved into: <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτοις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἃ ἀγνοοῦσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">βλασφ</span>. (Winer decides in favour of this; so, too, Wiesinger, and Buttmann, p. 128). But <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς</span> may also be dependent on <span class="greekheb">ἀγνοοῦσιν</span>, and be resolved: <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς ἀγνοοῦσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">βλασφημοῦντες</span>. There is no other instance to be found of the construction <span class="greekheb">βλασφημεῖν ἐν</span>, although <span class="greekheb">βλασφημεῖν εἰς</span> occurs frequently. Buttmann accordingly says that by <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> here (not the object strictly speaking, but) “rather the sphere is denoted, within which the evil-speaking takes place;” nor is the combination of <span class="greekheb">ἀγνοεῖν</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> common, “yet it is not without example in later writings;” it is to be found in <span class="ital">Test. XII. patr.</span> in <span class="ital">Fabricius cod. pseudepigr. V. T.</span> p. 717. That <span class="greekheb">ἀγνοεῖν</span>, in the sense of it, may be joined with <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, is shown by the German expression, “to be ignorant <span class="ital">in</span> a matter.” Besides, in both constructions the sense is substantially the same. According to the connection with what precedes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-10.htm" title="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2 Peter 2:10</a>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm" title="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Judges 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-10.htm" title="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Judges 1:10</a>, the <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span> are to be understood as that which was unknown to them, and to which their slanders had reference. On account of this irrational evil-speaking, that will happen to them which is expressed in the words: <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ φθορὰ αὐτῶν καὶ φθαρήσονται</span>. <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> has been understood here to mean moral corruption; thus de Wette-Brückner, Steinfass, Fronmüller; erroneously, however, for the word must have the same meaning in this passage as it had formerly; then, in this case, <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> does not refer to the Libertines, but to the <span class="greekheb">ζῶα</span> before mentioned, and <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is to be explained from the comparison with these. They (the Libertines) whose <span class="ital">irrational</span> slander of that of which they are ignorant, makes them like unto the <span class="ital">irrational</span> brutes, will also suffer <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span>, like the latter, who by nature are destined thereto. Entirely different from this, however, is the interpretation given by Hofmann. He resolves <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς</span> into <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτοις ἅ</span>, and takes <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτοις</span> with <span class="greekheb">φθαρήσονται</span>; that which, without knowing it, they speak evil of, is, according to him, the things of sense; he understands <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ φθορᾷ αὐτῶν</span> to be in more definite and explanatory apposition to <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτοις</span>, and <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> actively, equivalent to “abuse.” In his view, then, the idea here expressed is that the Libertines by abusing, after their lusts, the things of sense, believing them to have nothing in common with God, fall a prey to destruction. The objections to this interpretation are, first, that <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς</span> is not applied to any of the verba near it, but to the <span class="ital">remote</span> <span class="greekheb">φθαρήσονται</span>; secondly, that a meaning is attributed to the second <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> different from that of the first,—the one is taken as equivalent to “consumption,” the other to “abuse,”—and that neither of these significations belongs in any way to the word; thirdly, that the reference to the things of sense is in no way alluded to in the context; fourthly, that <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ φθορᾷ</span> cannot possibly be in apposition to <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτοις</span>; and lastly, that, on this interpretation, we should have had <span class="greekheb">ἀγνοοῦντες βλασφήμουσι</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ἀγνοοῦσιν βλασφημοῦντες</span>.[72]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] Schott agrees with Hofmann in regard to the application to things of sense, and to the interpretation of the meaning of the first <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span>, but differs from him in other points. He states the idea contained in the verse thus: “As irrational beasts, which … made to be taken and consumed … come to destruction, so these people shall perish; since they rail at those matters which they do not comprehend, they themselves shall perish in and with the destruction of those things against which they rail.” This interpretation is quite as unwarrantable as that of Hofmann.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_peter/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2 Peter 2:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">γεγεννημένα φυσικὰ</span>—“born creatures of instinct”. Instinct is here distinguished from the rational centres of thought and judgment. They are <span class="greekheb">ἄλογα ζῷα</span>. Their chief characteristic is that they are “alive,” and have no sense of the moral issues of life. Like animals, they exist <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἅλωσιν καὶ φθοράν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς ἀγνοοῦσιν βλασφημοῦντες</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτοις ἃ</span> … “Speaking lightly of things they are ignorant of”. Spiritually they are incapable. They know not what they do, in thus clouding moral issues, <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ φθορᾷ αὐτῶν καὶ φθαρήσονται</span>. Here is a subtle example of the dependence of this epistle upon Jude. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-10.htm" title="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Judges 1:10</a>, we have <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτοις φθείρονται</span>, referring to <span class="greekheb">ὅσα δὲ φυσικῶς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπίστανται</span>. The sense in 2 Peter is confused, and there is no distinction between the two kinds of knowledge, although the intended meaning in both passages is the same. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-5.htm" title="For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit....">Romans 8:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_peter/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">as irrational merely natural animals born for capture and destruction</span>. A different order of the words in some MSS. justifies the rendering <span class="bld">born by their nature</span>. The words express a strong indignation, at first sight scarcely reconcilable with the implied protest against a railing accusation. It must be remembered however that the whole context implies a depth of infamy and impurity for which no language could well be too strong in its scornful condemnation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">speak evil of the things that they understand not</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">speaking evil</span> (or <span class="bld">railing) in the things in which they are ignorant</span>. The words point to the same form of railing as before. They present, as it were, the evil of which St Paul speaks (“intruding into those things which they have not seen,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>) at its opposite pole. As, on the one hand, there was the danger of an undue reverence for angelic “dignities,” so, on the other, there was the peril of men acting irreverently, from the standpoint of an equally crass ignorance, and speaking of the mystery of spiritual evil, not with solemn awe, but with foolish talking and jesting.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and shall utterly perish in their own corruption</span>] We cannot improve on the English rendering, but it fails to give the emphasis which is found in the Greek from the repetition of the same root both in the noun and the verb. Literally the clause runs, <span class="bld">they shall be corrupted in and by their corruption</span>, i.e. in St Paul’s words, of which these are in fact the echo, “they that sow to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm" title="For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.">Galatians 6:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2 Peter 2:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄλογα ζῶα</span>, <span class="ital">animals without reason</span>) This differs widely from angels, Ps. 49:21.—<span class="greekheb">φυσικὰ γεγεννημένα</span>) <span class="ital">born mere natural animals</span>, ignoble from their very birth, and acting in accordance with their origin, <span class="greekheb">φυσικῶς</span>, <span class="ital">naturally</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-10.htm" title="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Judges 1:10</a>; following the natural guidance of their senses, in food, etc., and not knowing anything superior to these things, anything beyond what is natural, anything spiritual. There follows, <span class="ital">in those things which they know not</span>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἅλωσιν καὶ φθορὰν</span>, <span class="ital">for capture and destruction</span>) Antithetical to men, who ought to have aimed <span class="ital">at liberty</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-19.htm" title="While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.">2 Peter 2:19</a>) <span class="ital">and heavenly glory</span>.—<span class="greekheb">βλασφημοῦντες</span>, <span class="ital">speaking evil</span>) There ought to be great caution in our language.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ φθορᾷ αὐτῶν καταφθαρήσονται</span>, <span class="ital">they shall utterly perish in their own corruption</span>) The <span class="ital">destruction</span> caused by iniquity, has for its just reward <span class="ital">destruction full of misery</span>.

Speak evil of the things that they understand not; literally, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">railing in matters whereof they are ignorant.</span> (For the construction, see Wirier, 3:66. 5, at the end.) The context and the parallel passage in St. Jude show that the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the glories, are the things which the false teachers understand not and at which they rail. Good angels do not pronounce a railing judgment against angels that sinned. These men, knowing nothing of the angelic sphere of existence, rail at the elect and the fallen angels alike, lien should speak with awe of the sin of the angels; jesting on such subjects is unbecoming and dangerous. And shall utterly perish in their own corruption.

It seems better to take <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> in the sense of "corruption" here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>, and to suppose that St. Peter is intentionally playing on the double sense of the noun and its cognate verb than, with Huther, to refer the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "their own," to the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>, and to understand St. Peter as meaning that the false teachers, who act like irrational animals, shall be destroyed with the destruction of irrational animals. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_peter/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>As natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed<p>This massing of epithets is characteristic of Peter. Natural (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768;), Rev., mere animals, should be construed with made, or as Rev., born (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;). Brute (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;), lit., unreasoning or irrational. Rev., without reason. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-27.htm">Acts 25:27</a>. Beasts (&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3b1;). Lit., living creatures, from &#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;, to live. More general and inclusive than beasts, since it denotes strictly all creatures that live, including man. Plato even applies it to God himself. Hence Rev., properly, creatures. To be taken and destroyed (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;). Lit., for capture and destruction. Destruction twice in this verse, and with a cognate verb. Render the whole, as Rev., But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed.<p>Speak evil (&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Participle.

The and, which in the A. V. connects this and the preceding sentence, is rather to be taken with shall be destroyed, as emphasizing it, and should be rendered, as Rev., surely, or as others, even or also. Compare on the whole verse Jde 1:10. </body></html>
