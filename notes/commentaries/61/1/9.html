The Greek implies absence of possession in any degree, not merely absence of permanent possession.

There is, therefore, no anti-climax, a weak expression following a strong one, but a simple explanation, a more definite term following a general one; it explains what kind of blindness is meant. The special kind of short-sightedness here indicated is that of one who just sees that he is a member of a Christian community, but perceives neither the kind of life that one who has been purged from heathen enormities is bound to lead, nor the kind of life which alone can win an entrance into Christ’s kingdom. The shortsightedness of not being able to see beyond this present world is probably not expressed here.<p><span class= "bld">And hath forgotten.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">having received</span> or <span class= "ital">incurred forgetfulness</span>—a unique expression in the New Testament. The phrase does not necessarily imply that the forgetfulness is voluntary; it is the inevitable result of wilful neglect—the neglect to cultivate Christian virtues.

But Paul himself hath taught the sound meaning of Ananias’s words, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>,) <span class="ital">Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. </span>Besides, Peter, in his first epistle, tells us expressly that <span class="ital">baptism is not the washing away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, </span>in which respect it resembles circumcision, <span class="ital">which is not that which is outward, but of the heart, </span>by cutting off all irregular passions and appetites. The washing in baptism, therefore, is not a real, but an emblematical washing of the sinner from the guilt of his sins.” Which emblem, as it contains a promise of pardon, so it is realized to all truly penitent sinners, who believe in Christ <span class="ital">with their hearts unto righteousness, </span>and to none else.

Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he that lacketh these things is blind - He has no clear views of the nature and the requirements of religion.<p>And cannot see afar off - The word used here, which does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, (&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  muo&#772;pazo&#772;n,) means to shut the eyes; i. e., to contract the eyelids, to blink, to twinkle, as one who cannot see clearly, and hence to be "near-sighted." The meaning here is, that he is like one who has an indistinct vision; one who can see only the objects that are near him, but who has no correct apprehension of objects that are more remote. He sees but a little way into the true nature and design of the gospel. He does not take those large and clear views which would enable him to comprehend the whole system at a glance.<p>And hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins - He does not remember the obligation which grows out of the fact that a system has been devised to purify the heart, and that he has been so far brought under the power of that system as to have his sins forgiven.

"Once purged (with Christ's blood), we should have no more consciousness of sin (as condemning us, Heb 10:2, because of God's promise)."

Or in, and with whom, they are not; that is, these virtues, as the Arabic version reads, as faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity; where the principles of those things are not, and they are not exercised and performed, such an one <p>is blind: let him boast ever so much of his light and knowledge, and value himself upon it, and expect to be saved by it, let him live as he will; for he has no true knowledge of God, as in Christ, as the God of all grace, as his covenant God and Father; nor does he know what it is to have communion with him in Christ; he only professes to know him in words, while in works he denies him; nor has he any right knowledge of Christ, only notional and general, not spiritual, experimental, particular, and practical; he does not see the Son, so as truly to believe in him; he has no true sight of his beauty, suitableness, and fulness, and of him for himself; nor any experience of the work of the Spirit of God upon his heart, whom he neither receives, sees, nor knows spiritually, any more than the world itself does; nor does he see the plague of his own heart, the corruptions of his nature, and the exceeding sinfulness of sin; nor has he any true spiritual light into the Gospel, and the doctrines of it, only a form of godliness, without the power of it: and therefore, whatever natural understanding of things he has, he is spiritually blind, <p>and cannot see afar off: at least, not the good land that is afar off, the kingdom of heaven; the invisible glories of the other world; things that are not seen, which are eternal, which one that has true faith has a glimpse and sight of; nor Christ, who is in heaven at the right hand of God, and the things of Christ, his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, carried within the vail; nor even what is within himself, the sins of his heart, the pollution of his nature, and the evil that dwells there; he sees not that he is poor, and wretched, and miserable, but fancies himself to be rich, and in need of nothing; he sees nothing but outward things, the things of time and sense, worldly and earthly things, which are near him, and all around him, which he minds, on which his heart is set, and he pursues with rigour. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "trying with the hand", as blind men do, feeling and groping to find the way; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-27.htm">Acts 17:27</a>, <p>and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins; not by baptism, from the sins committed before it, for that does not purge from any sins, old or new, but that which it leads the faith of believers to, for pardon and cleansing, even the blood of Christ; but this also, and purification by it, is not meant here, though generally interpreters give this as the sense, and understanding it of the sin of ingratitude in such a person, who had received so great a benefit by Christ, and was unmindful of it; since it cannot be thought that one so described as above should ever have had his conscience purged by the blood of Christ from his old sins, or those before conversion, unless it be by profession; and then the sense is, that he has forgotten that he once professed to have been purged from all his sins by Christ; which, if he had, would have made him zealous of good works, and put him upon glorifying Christ both in body and spirit. The Ethiopic version renders it, "and he hath forgot to purge himself from old sins"; which he would have been concerned for, had he had a true and spiritual knowledge of Christ, and his Gospel, and an application of the exceeding great and precious promises of it, or had been made a partaker of the divine nature through them; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>, but the words are better rendered agreeably to the original text, "and hath forgotten the purification of his old, or former sins"; or "sins of old"; as they are rendered by the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions; that is, he does not consider, nor think of it, that he was a sinner of old, a sinner in Adam, that he was conceived and shapen in sin, and went astray, and was called a transgressor from the womb; he does not think that he stands in any need of being purged from former sins; and is entirely unmindful of, and neglects, the purification of them by the blood of Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_peter/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But he that lacketh these things is blind, and (i) cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</span><p>(i) He that has not an effectual knowledge of God in him, is blind concerning the kingdom of God, for he cannot see things that are afar off, that is to say, heavenly things.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_peter/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm" title="But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.">2 Peter 1:9</a> gives in negative form an explanation of the preceding verses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ᾧ γὰρ μὴ πάρεστι ταῦτα</span>] antithesis to <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> … <span class="greekheb">πλεονάζοντα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Peter 1:8</a>.

Schott correctly explains <span class="greekheb">μυωπάζων</span> by “<span class="ital">weak</span>-sighted.” The older commentators, following Oecumenius, for the most part take <span class="greekheb">μυωπάζειν</span> as synonymous with <span class="greekheb">τυφλώττειν</span>; thus Calvin, Hornejus, etc.; but the identification in meaning of these two terms cannot be justified, whilst it gives rise to an intolerable tautology. The translation of the Vulgate: manu tentans (similarly Erasmus: manu viam tentans; Luther: “and gropes with the hand;” Calvin: manu palpans), has arisen probably from the gloss: <span class="greekheb">ψηλαφῶν</span>, perhaps with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/28-28.htm" title="The LORD shall smite you with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:...">Deuteronomy 28:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-10.htm" title="We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.">Isaiah 59:10</a>. Wolf interprets the word, after Bochart (Hierozoic l. l. c. 4), by <span class="greekheb">καμμύειν</span> oculos claudere;[38] but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΥΩΠΆΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span> is not derived from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΎΕΙΝ ΤᾺς ὮΠΑς</span></span></span>, but from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΎΩΨ</span></span></span>. A <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΎΩΨ</span></span></span>, however, is not one who arbitrarily closes his eyes, but one who, from inability to see far enough, is obliged to blink with his eyes, in order to see a distant object. The same applies to Dietlein, who translates: “one who closes his eyes,” by which he conceives a <span class="ital">voluntary</span> closing of the eyes, precisely that which is opposed to the meaning of the word. If, then, <span class="greekheb">μυωπάζων</span> mean a short-sighted person, the question arises: What is that near at hand which he sees, and that far off which he does not see? The first expression is generally understood as applying to earthly, and the second to heavenly things. Hofmann, on the other hand, explains: “he sees only what is present to him: that he is a member of the Christian church; but how he has become so, that lies outside his horizon.” Here, however, the first thought is purely imported, and the second has only an apparent justification in the clause which follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΉΘΗΝ ΛΑΒΏΝ</span></span></span>] <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἍΠ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΛΕΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> equal to oblitus; Vulgate: oblivionem accipiens; cf. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΌΜΝΗΣΙΝ ΛΑΒΏΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-5.htm" title="When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.">2 Timothy 1:5</a> (cf.

Dietlein arbitrarily emphasizes this forgetting as a <span class="ital">voluntary</span> act.

Is the reference to baptism? This view is rendered very probable by the use of <span class="greekheb">πάλαι</span>.

The causal conjunction is important in the sequence of thought. We are to press on from height to height of Christian excellence, <span class="ital">for</span>, if we do not so press, we sink back into a want of power to perceive even the elementary truths of the kingdom of God. The second of the two words describing this state is defined by Aristotle (<span class="ital">Probl</span>. 31) as denoting the state of those who are naturally “short-sighted,” and is thus adequately rendered in the English version. The man in this state in his spiritual power of vision sees the near things, the circumstances, allurements, provocations of his daily life, but he has lost the power to look to the far-off things of the life eternal. This seems, on the whole, a truer interpretation than that which, taking the definition of the word given by some Greek lexicographers as meaning “one who closes his eyes,” sees in it a description of one whose blindness is self-caused, who wilfully closes the eyes of the spirit that he may not look upon the truth. The state of the blind man who saw “men, as trees, walking” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-24.htm" title="And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.">Mark 8:24</a>) offers a suggestive parallel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">and hath taken to himself forgetfulness</span> (the noun is not found elsewhere in the New Testament) <span class="bld">of the purification of his sins of long ago</span>. The spiritual fact described is like that of which St James speaks, and indicates a like train of thought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/1-23.htm" title="For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glass:...">James 1:23-24</a>). The “purification” is that of conversion symbolized and made effectual by baptism, and connects itself with the stress laid upon it in the words that belong to one great crisis of the Apostle’s life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-15.htm" title="And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-9.htm" title="But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-9.htm" title="And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.">Acts 15:9</a>). The man who forgets this cleansing of his soul, and acts as if he were in his simply natural state, with no power to resist temptation, does in fact ignore what God has done for him, and treats “the sins of long ago” as though they were still the inevitable accompaniments of the present.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm" title="But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.">2 Peter 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) in its proper sense.—<span class="greekheb">τυφλός ἐστι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">he is blind</span>, etc.) The steps of his relapses are depicted by a choice retrogression or inversion of style. Such a <a href="http://apocrypha.org/prayer_of_manasseh/1-1.htm" title="O LORD Almighty, the God of our fathers Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and of their righteous seed;">Man 1:1</a>) forgets that he was cleansed from his sins, <span class="ital">which are past</span>; 2) he is dim-sighted as to <span class="ital">present</span> privileges, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-12.htm" title="Why I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth.">2 Peter 1:12</a>; 2 Peter 3) he is altogether blind as to those that are <span class="ital">future</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm" title="For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.">2 Peter 1:11</a>. The <span class="ital">inversion</span> of the style consists in this, that the reference to <span class="ital">past</span> time in the text is put in the last place, whereas according to the nature of the subject it should be said, <span class="ital">past, present, future</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μυωπάζων</span>, <span class="ital">dim-sighted</span>) Hesychius, <span class="greekheb">μυωπάζων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὀφθαλμιῶν</span> <span class="ital">affected with ophthalmia</span>.—<span class="greekheb">λήθην λαβὼν</span>) <span class="ital">having obtained forgetfulness</span>.

Such a man can only see the things which lie close around him - earth and earthly things; he cannot lift up his eyes by faith and behold "the land that is very far off;" he cannot "see the King in his beauty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). The word for "short-sighted" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament. And hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins; literally, <span class="accented">having incurred forgetfulness of the cleansing from his old sins.</span> St. Peter is apparently thinking of the one baptism for the remission of sin. Ananias had said to Saul, "Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>); St. Peter himself had said, in his first great sermon, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." Those who do not realize in the religious life that death unto sin of which holy baptism is the sign and the beginning, incur forgetfulness of the cleansing from sin which they then received; they do not use the grace once given for the attainment of those higher graces of which St. Peter has been speaking. The one talent once entrusted to them must be taken from them; they are idle and unfruitful, and cannot reach unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>But (&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;)<p>Wrong.

From &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to close, and &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c8;, the eye. Closing or contracting the eyes like short-sighted people. Hence, to be short-sighted. The participle being short-sighted is added to the adjective blind, defining it; as if he had said, is blind, that is, short-sighted spiritually; seeing only things present and not heavenly things. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>. Rev. renders, seeing only what is near.<p>And hath forgotten (&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., having taken forgetfulness. A unique expression, the noun occurring only here in the New Testament. Compare a similar phrase, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;, having taken remembrance: A. V., when I call to remembrance: Rev., having been reminded of. Some expositors find in the expression a suggestion of a voluntary acceptance of a darkened condition. This is doubtful, however. Lumby thinks that it marks the advanced years of the writer, since he adds to failure of sight the failure of memory, that faculty on which the aged dwell more than on sight.<p>That he was purged (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Rev., more literally, the cleansing. </body></html>
