To make “honour” refer to the voice, and “glory” to the light shining from Christ’s body, about which nothing has been said, is forced and unnatural.<p><span class= "bld">When there came such a voice to him.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">in that a voice was borne to Him speaking thus.</span> The expression “a voice was borne to Him” is peculiar, and occurs nowhere else. The Greek for “the grace that is to be brought to you” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1Peter 1:13</a>) is parallel to it, and is another small coincidence worth noting. Note also that the writer has not slavishly followed any of the three accounts of the Transfiguration, which a forger might be expected to do. A genuine witness, knowing that he is on firm ground can afford to take his own line; a “claimant” must carefully learn and follow the lines of others.<p><span class= "bld">From the excellent glory.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">by the excellent glory</span>—another unique expression. The preposition “by” almost compels us to reject the interpretation that either the bright cloud or heaven itself is meant. It is rather a periphrasis for God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm" title="There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heaven in your help, and in his excellency on the sky.">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>. God is called by the LXX., “the Excellent of the sky.”<p><span class= "bld">This is my beloved Son, . . .</span>—The Greek is almost the same as in St. Matthew’s account (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm" title="While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.">Matthew 17:5</a>); but “hear him” is omitted, and for “in Whom” we here have, “unto Whom” which can scarcely be brought into the English sentence. The meaning is “<span class= "ital">unto Whom</span> my good pleasure came and on Whom it abides.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a>, and Clem., <span class= "ital">Hom.</span> III. liii.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:16-21 The gospel is no weak thing, but comes in power, Ro 1:16. The law sets before us our wretched state by sin, but there it leaves us. It discovers our disease, but does not make known the cure. It is the sight of Jesus crucified, in the gospel, that heals the soul. Try to dissuade the covetous worlding from his greediness, one ounce of gold weighs down all reasons. Offer to stay a furious man from anger by arguments, he has not patience to hear them. Try to detain the licentious, one smile is stronger with him than all reason. But come with the gospel, and urge them with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, shed to save their souls from hell, and to satisfy for their sins, and this is that powerful pleading which makes good men confess that their hearts burn within them, and bad men, even an Agrippa, to say they are almost persuaded to be Christians, Ac 26:28. God is well pleased with Christ, and with us in him. This is the Messiah who was promised, through whom all who believe in him shall be accepted and saved. The truth and reality of the gospel also are foretold by the prophets and penmenof the Old Testament, who spake and wrote under influence, and according to the direction of the Spirit of God. How firm and sure should our faith be, who have such a firm and sure word to rest upon! When the light of the Scripture is darted into the blind mind and dark understanding, by the Holy Spirit of God, it is like the day-break that advances, and diffuses itself through the whole soul, till it makes perfect day. As the Scripture is the revelation of the mind and will of God, every man ought to search it, to understand the sense and meaning. The Christian knows that book to be the word of God, in which he tastes a sweetness, and feels a power, and sees a glory, truly divine. And the prophecies already fulfilled in the person and salvation of Christ, and in the great concerns of the church and the world, form an unanswerable proof of the truth of Christianity. The Holy Ghost inspired holy men to speak and write. He so assisted and directed them in delivering what they had received from him, that they clearly expressed what they made known. So that the Scriptures are to be accounted the words of the Holy Ghost, and all the plainness and simplicity, all the power and all the propriety of the words and expressions, come from God. Mix faith with what you find in the Scriptures, and esteem and reverence the Bible as a book written by holy men, taught by the Holy Ghost.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he received from God the Father honour and glory - He was honored by God in being thus addressed.<p>When there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory - The magnificent splendor; the bright cloud which overshadowed them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>.<p>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>.

Not as an inferior from a superior, for he was equal in glory with the Father, and was, and is, the brightness of his Father's glory; nor essentially, having the same glory as his Father, and to which nothing can be added; but declaratively, God the Father testifying of his glory, declaring the honour that belonged to him, as the Son of God, at the same time that an external glory was put on him, and received by him, as the son of man: <p>when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory; from the bright cloud which overshadowed Jesus, Moses, and Elijah and was a symbol of the glory and presence of God, as the cloud in the tabernacle and temple were, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>, or from heaven, the habitation of the holiness and glory of God, and where he displays the glory of his being and perfections; or from himself, who is the God and Father of glory, and is glorious in himself, in all his attributes and works. So  "glory", with the Cabalistic Jews, signifies the Shechinah, or divine presence (d); and every number in the Cabalistic tree is called by the name of "glory"; the second number, which is "wisdom", is called "the first glory"; and the third number, "understanding", is called , "the supreme", or "chief glory" (e): so the first path, which is the supreme crown, is sometimes called the first glory, as the Father is here the most excellent glory; and the second path, which is the understanding enlightening, the second glory (f). And this voice was not that at his baptism; for though that was from heaven, and from God the Father, and expressed the same words as here; yet it was not on a mount, nor from a cloud, nor was it heard by the apostles, who, as yet, were not with Christ, nor called by him; nor that of which mention is made in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28</a>, for though that also was from God the Father, and from heaven, and which declaratively gave honour and glory to Christ, yet did not express the words here mentioned; but that voice which came from the cloud, when Christ was transfigured on the mount, and which was heard by his three disciples, Peter, James, and John, when the following words were articulately pronounced, "this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased": See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>.

The participle does not require any such supplement as <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐτύγχανε</span>, nor is it put instead of the finite verb. For the principal thought is, not that Christ was transfigured, but that Peter was a witness of this transfiguration, which was typical of the <span class="greekheb">δύναμις καὶ παρουσία</span> of Christ. The finite verb belonging to the participle <span class="greekheb">λαβών</span> is wanting. Its absence is most naturally accounted for by supposing, that the addition of <span class="greekheb">φωνῆς ἐνεχθείσης κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. caused the author to forget to notice that he had not written <span class="greekheb">ἔλαβε γάρ</span>. How after writing <span class="greekheb">λαβών</span> he intended to proceed, cannot be definitely said; what is wanting, however, must be supplied from that which goes before, not from what follows. Winer, p. 330 [E. T. 442], incorrectly supplies the necessary complement from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-18.htm" title="And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.">2 Peter 1:18</a>, since he says that Peter should have continued: <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς εἶχε ταύτην τὴν φωνὴν ἀκούσαντας</span>, or in a similar manner. But it is still more arbitrary to borrow the supplement from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2 Peter 1:19</a> (as is done by Dietlein and Schott).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">παρὰ θεοῦ πατρός</span>] <span class="greekheb">πατήρ</span> is applied here to God in His relation to Christ, with reference to the subsequent <span class="greekheb">ὁ υἱός μου</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τιμὴν καὶ δόξαν</span>] “Honour and glory,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-10.htm" title="But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:">Romans 2:10</a>; <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> denotes not the brightness of Christ’s body at the transfiguration (Hornejus, Gerhard, etc. Steinfass would understand <span class="ital">both</span> expressions of the shining figure of Christ). Hofmann is unwarranted in finding in <span class="greekheb">λαβὼν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. a confirmation of his opinion that it is the resurrection and ascension that are here referred to, inasmuch as God first conferred honour and glory upon Christ, by raising Him from the dead and exalting Him.

If we are to press the distinctive force of each, the “honour” may be thought of as referring to the attesting voice at the Transfiguration, the “glory” to the light which enveloped the person of the Christ, like the Shechinah cloud of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,...">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/17-1.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,...">Matthew 17:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-2.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and leads them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them....">Mark 9:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-28.htm" title="And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray....">Luke 9:28-36</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">when such a voice as this was borne to Him</span>. The choice of the verb instead of the more usual word for “came,” connects itself with the use of the same verb in St Luke’s account of the Pentecostal gift (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-2.htm" title="And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.">Acts 2:2</a>), and the Apostle’s own use of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2 Peter 1:21</a> in connexion with the gift of prophecy. The word for “excellent” (more literally, <span class="bld">magnificent</span>, or <span class="bld">majestic</span>, as describing the transcendent brightness of the Shechinahcloud), not found elsewhere in the New Testament, is, perhaps, an echo from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm" title="There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heaven in your help, and in his excellency on the sky.">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, where God is described as “the excellent (or <span class="ital">majestic</span>) One of the firmament.” The corresponding noun appears in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-5.htm" title="His glory is great in your salvation: honor and majesty have you laid on him.">Psalm 21:5</a>, where the English version has “majesty.” The Greek preposition has the force of “by” rather than “from” the glory, the person of the Father being identified with the Glory which was the token of His presence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</span>] The words are given, with one slight variation not perceptible in the English, as we find them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm" title="While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.">Matthew 17:5</a>. It is obvious, assuming the genuineness of the Epistle, that we have here a testimony of great value to the truth of the Gospel records. As there is no reference to any written record of the words, and, we may add, as St Peter omits the words “Hear ye Him,” which St Matthew adds, the testimony has distinctly the character of independence. Had the Epistle been the spurious work of a pseudonymous writer, it is at least probable that they would have been given in the precise form in which they are found in one or other of the Gospels. St Mark and St Luke, it may be noted, omit the words “in whom I am well pleased.” The tense used in the Greek of these words is past, and not present, implying that the “delight” with which the Father contemplated the Son had been from eternity. The whole passage has a special interest, as pointing to the place which the Transfiguration occupied in the spiritual education of the three disciples who witnessed it. The Apostle looked back upon it, in his old age, as having stamped on his mind ineffaceably the conviction that the glory on which he had then looked was the pledge and earnest of that hereafter to be revealed. Comp. the probable reference to the same event in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2 Peter 1:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λαβὼν</span>, <span class="ital">having received</span>) The participle is put for the indicative. <span class="ital">He received</span>, by the testimony of His Father.—<span class="greekheb">τιμὴν καὶ δόξαν</span>, <span class="ital">honour and glory</span>) divine.

Winer supposes that the apostle had intended to continue with some such words as, "He had us for witnesses," or, "He was declared to be the beloved Son of God," and that the construction was interrupted by the direct quotation of the words spoken by the voice from heaven ('Grammar,' 3:45, b). (For a similar anacoluthon, see in the Greek <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-6.htm">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>.) "Honour" seems to refer to the testimony of the voice from heaven; "glory," to the splendour of the Lord's transfigured Person. <span class="cmt_word">When there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">when such a voice was borne to him.</span> The same verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a> of "the <span class="accented">rushing</span> mighty wind" which announced the coming of the Holy Ghost; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a> of "the grace which is being brought." It is repeated in the next verse. It seems intended to assert emphatically the real objective character of the voice. It was not a vision, a dream; the voice was borne from heaven; the apostles heard it with their ears. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> must be rendered "by," not "from." The "excellent" (rather, "majestic," or "magnificent") glory was the Shechinah, the visible manifestation of the presence of God, which had appeared in ancient times on Mount Sinai, and in the tabernacle and temple above the mercy-seat. God was there; it was he who spoke. For the word rendered "excellent" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) compare the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "the Majestic One of the firmament;" where our Authorized Version gives a more exact translation of the Hebrew, "in his excellency on the sky" (see also the 'Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians,' chapter 9, where the occurrence of the same remarkable words, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, suggests that Clement must have been acquainted with this Epistle). This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Our translation makes these words correspond exactly with the report given by St. Matthew in his account of the Transfiguration, except that "hear ye him" is added there. In the Greek there are some slight variations. According to one ancient manuscript (the Vatican), the order of the words is different, and there is a second pen, "This is my Son, my Beloved." All uncial manuscripts have here, instead of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span> of St. Matthew's Gospel, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. The difference cannot be represented in our translation. The construction is pregnant, and the meaning is that from all eternity the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the good pleasure, of God the Father was directed towards the Divine Son, and still abideth on him. The same truth seems to be implied in the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"). An imitator of the second century would certainly have made this quotation to correspond exactly with the words as given in one of the synoptic Gospels. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>When there came (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., having been borne.
