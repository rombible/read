Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a>. "In view of these things, give the greater diligence to secure your salvation." The considerations on which Peter based this appeal seem to have been the fact that such promises are made to us, and such hopes held out before us; the degree of uncertainty thrown over the whole matter of our personal salvation by low attainments in the divine life, and the dreadful condemnation which will ensue if in the end it shall be found that we are destitute of all real piety. The general thought is, that religion is of sufficient importance to claim our highest diligence, and to arouse us to the most earnest efforts to obtain the assurance of salvation.<p>To make your calling and election sure - On the meaning of the word "calling," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>. On the meaning of the word "election," see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a> note. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>. The word rendered "election" here, (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;  ekloge&#772;n,) occurs only in this place and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>; though corresponding words from the same root denoting "the elect, to elect, to choose," frequently occur. The word here used means "election," referring to the act of God, by which those who are saved are "chosen" to eternal life. As the word "calling" must refer to the act of God, so the word "election" must; for it is God who both "calls" and "chooses" those who shall be saved. The word in the Scriptures usually refers to the actual choosing of those who shall be saved; that is, referring to the time when they, in fact, become the children of God, rather than to the purpose of God that it shall be done; but still there must have been an eternal purpose, for God makes no choice which he did not always intend to make.<p>The word "sure," means firm, steadfast, secure, (&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  bebaian.) Here the reference must be to "themselves;" that is, they were so to act as to make it certain to themselves that they had been chosen, and were truly called into the kingdom of God. It cannot refer to God, for no act of theirs could make it more certain on his part, if they had been actually chosen to eternal life. Still, God everywhere treats men as moral agents; and what may be absolutely certain in his mind from the mere purpose that it "shall" be so, is to be made certain to us only by evidence, and in the free exercise of our own powers. The meaning here is, that they were to obtain such evidences of personal piety as to put the question whether they were "called" and "chosen," so far as their own minds were concerned, to rest; or so as to have undoubted evidence on this point. The Syriac, the Vulgate, and some Greek manuscripts, insert here the expression "by your good works;" that is, they were to make their calling sure "by" their good works, or by holy living.<p>This clause, as Calvin remarks, is not authorized by the best authority, but it does not materially affect the sense. It was undoubtedly by their "good works" in the sense of holy living, or of lives consecrated to the service of God, that they were to obtain the evidence that they were true Christians; that is, that they had been really called into the kingdom of God, for there is nothing else on which we can depend for such evidence. God has given no assurance to us by name that he intends to save us. We can rely on no voice, or vision, or new revelation, to prove that it is so. No internal feeling of itself, no raptures, no animal excitement, no confident persuasion in our own minds that we are elected, can be proof in the case; and the only certain evidence on which we can rely is that which is found in a life of sincere piety. In view of the important statement of Peter in this verse, then, we may remark:<p>(1) that he believed in the doctrine of election, for he uses language which obviously implies this, or such as they are accustomed to use who believe the doctrine.<p>(2) the fact that God has chosen those who shall be saved, does not make our own efforts unnecessary to make that salvation sure to us. It can be made sure to our own minds only by our own exertions; by obtaining evidence that we are in fact the children of God. There can be no evidence that salvation will be ours, unless there is a holy life; that is, unless there is true religion. Whatever may be the secret purpose of God in regard to us, the only evidence that we have that we shall be saved is to be found in the fact that we are sincere Christians, and are honestly endeavoring to do his will.<p>(3) it is possible to make our calling and election sure; that is, to have such evidence on the subject that the mind shall be calm, and that there will be no danger of deception. If we can determine the point that we are in fact true Christians, that settles the matter - for then the unfailing promise of God meets us that we shall be saved. In making our salvation sure to our own minds, if we are in fact true Christians, we have not to go into an argument to prove that we have sufficient strength to resist temptation, of that we shall be able in any way to keep ourselves. All that matter is settled by the promise of God, that if we are Christians we shall be kept by Him to salvation. The only question that is to be settled is, whether we are in fact true Christians, and all beyond that may be regarded as determined immutably. But assuredly it is possible for a man to determine the question whether he is or is not a true Christian.<p>(4) if it can be done, it should be. Nothing is more important for us to do than this; and to this great inquiry we should apply our minds with unfaltering diligence, until by the grace of God we can say that there are no lingering doubts n regard to our final salvation.<p>For if ye do these things - The things referred to in the previous verses. If you use all diligence to make as high attainments as possible in piety, and it you practice the virtues demanded by religion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5-7</a>.<p>Ye shall never fall - You shall never fall into perdition.

God must work all these graces in us, yet not so that we should be mere machines, but willing instruments in His hands in making His election of us "secure." The ensuring of our election is spoken of not in respect to God, whose counsel is steadfast and everlasting, but in respect to our part. There is no uncertainty on His part, but on ours the only security is our faith in His promise and the fruits of the Spirit (2Pe 1:5-7, 11). Peter subjoins election to calling, because the calling is the effect and proof of God's election, which goes before and is the main thing (Ro 8:28, 30, 33, where God's "elect" are those "predestinated," and election is "His purpose," according to which He "called" them). We know His calling before His election, thereby calling is put first.<p>fall&#8212;Greek, "stumble" and fall finally (Ro 11:11).

To exercise the afore mentioned graces, and to perform the above duties, since this is the way <p>to make your calling and election sure; by calling is not meant a call to any office in the church, nor an external call, either by the voice of nature, or by the ministry of the word; but an internal and effectual call by special grace, to grace here, and glory hereafter; instead of "calling", the Alexandrian copy reads, "comfort": and by "election" is meant, not a national, nor church election, but a particular and personal one, since scattered saints, and particular believers, are here written to, and each called upon to be diligent to make their own, and not another's, calling and election sure; nor is a choice of persons to an office designed, seeing the apostle writes not to officers of churches in particular, but to believers in common; nor a separation of persons from the world by the effectual calling, since these two are both mentioned here, and as distinct from each other, and to be made sure; but an election of particular persons to eternal life and salvation is here intended, which is an eternal act of God, arises from his free grace and favour, and is according to his sovereign will and pleasure; and is absolute, and independent of any condition, foreseen, or required in men, as faith, holiness, and good works; all which are fruits and effects, and not causes and conditions of electing grace. These may be made "sure", not in themselves, or with respect to God, for in this sense they cannot be made surer than they are: effectual calling is according to the purpose of God, which cannot be frustrated, and is, without repentance, irreversible, and irrevocable, and is inseparably connected with eternal glory; and election stands not upon the foot of works, but upon the free grace of God, which cannot be made void, and upon the will of God, which cannot be resisted; and is also closely connected with glorification; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a> nor are those to be made sure by saints, with respect to themselves; for though they may sometimes be at a loss about them, and may have some scruples and doubts in their minds concerning their interest in them, and an assurance of their being both called and chosen, may be after all attained unto by them; yet this is not their work, but it is the work of the Spirit of God, to certify and make sure unto them, or assure them of their calling and election of God: but the sense is, that diligence is to be used by the saints, to make their calling and election sure to others; not their election by their calling only, which is to themselves; for both are to be made sure, and that to others, and by some third thing; either to their fellow Christians, which they may do by giving them an account of the work of God upon their souls, joined with a testimony of their good lives and conversations; or rather to the world "by good works", as the Vulgate Latin version and two copies of Beza's read; or "by your good works", as the Alexandrian copy and the Syriac and Ethiopic versions read; or by the exercise of the graces, and the discharge of the duties before mentioned, whereby the men of the world may be certified and assured, by the best evidence the saints are capable of giving to them, or they of receiving, that they are the called and chosen of God, they profess themselves to be; and which is a reason why those things should be done: and another follows, <p>for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall; or "sin", as the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions render it; not that they should never fall at all, or in any sense, for in many things we all offend or fall; or should ever commit any act of sin, or fall into sin, for there is no man that lives, and sins not; or that they should not fall from a degree of the lively exercise of grace, or from a degree of steadfastness in the doctrine of faith, but that they should never sin the sin against the Holy Ghost, or fall totally and finally; for though they fall, they should rise again by faith and repentance, through the grace and power of Christ, who is able to keep them from falling: and besides, while they were exercising those graces, and doing those duties, they should not fall; for these are the means of final perseverance, and therefore the rather to be regarded.

Resumption of the exhortation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὸ μᾶλλον</span>] <span class="greekheb">διό</span> is usually taken as referring to the truth expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ....">2 Peter 1:8-9</a>, and <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον</span> interpreted as equal to “all the more.” The meaning is then: that this truth should still more incite to zeal (thus Brückner, Wiesinger, Schott, etc.). Dietlein, on the other hand, takes <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον</span> as “ushering in an antithesis,” equal to “rather;” thus also Hofmann. The former supplies the thought: “instead of following a virtueless endeavour after a so-called <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span>,” for which, however, in the context there is no warrant. The latter more correctly applies it to what immediately precedes, in this sense, “the readers should do the opposite of that which Peter calls a forgetting that they have received the pardon of sin.”[39] That the particle <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον</span> frequently expresses an antithesis cannot be denied; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1 Corinthians 5:2</a> : but as little can it be questioned that it may serve to express intensification; cf. Meyer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>. In this way both interpretations are possible. Still that which is usually given appears to be preferable, inasmuch as it seems more natural to apply the very significant thought of this verse to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ....">2 Peter 1:8-9</a>, than only to the subordinate idea immediately preceding.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span>] makes the exhortation more urgent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σπουδάσατε</span> … <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖσθαι</span>] The exhortation here points back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2 Peter 1:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">σπουδὴν π</span>. <span class="greekheb">παρεισενέγκ</span>. The relations of <span class="greekheb">κλῆσις</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐκλογή</span> are thus stated by Gerhard: <span class="ital">vocatio</span>, qua in tempore ad regnum gratiae vocati estis; <span class="ital">electio</span>, qua ab aeterno ad regnum gloriae electi estis; in like manner Wiesinger, Fronmüller, etc.; cf. Lünemann also on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>. But <span class="greekheb">ἐκλογή</span> can also denote the election effected by the <span class="greekheb">κλῆσις</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the separation of those who are called from the world, and the translation of them into the kingdom of God. And this latter view is supported not only by the position in which the two ideas stand to each other, but by the connection of thought (Grotius, Brückner, Schott, Hofmann[40]); for the summons <span class="greekheb">βεβαίαν ποιεῖσθαι</span> can apply only to something which has been realiter accomplished in man, not to the decree of God in itself unchangeable and eternal. For this reason Calvin feels himself compelled unwarrantably to paraphrase <span class="greekheb">σπουδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">βεβ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖσθαι</span> by: studete ut re ipsa testatum fiat, vos non frustra vocatos esse, imo electos.[41]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For <span class="greekheb">βεβαίαν</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a>. The making sure takes place then, when the Christians, by a conduct such as is directed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2 Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Peter 1:8</a>, do their part to remain the called and elected people; the opposite of this is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm" title="But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.">2 Peter 1:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reading: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα διὰ τῶν καλῶν ὑμῶν ἔργων βεβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. reproduces the thought in substance correctly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ταῦτα γὰρ ποιοῦντες</span>] <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> refers not to the foregoing virtues, as Hofmann thinks, but to that which immediately precedes; “the plural shows that the apostle considered this making sure a very many-sided act” (Dietlein).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ μὴ πταίσητέ ποτε</span>] <span class="greekheb">πταίειν</span> means in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">Jam 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm" title="For in many things we offend all.

It is unjustifiable to combine the two ideas (de Wette: “to fall and so to fail of salvation”). The double negation <span class="greekheb">οὐ μή</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">ποτέ</span> placed at the end, strengthen the statement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[39] Hofmann interprets <span class="greekheb">διό</span> in harmony with his conception of ver. 2 Peter 2 : “for this reason, because he only, who is possessed of the aforenamed graces, is capable of putting his knowledge into practice.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[40] Grotius: date operam, ut et vocatio quae vobis contigit per evangelium et electio eam secuta, qua facti estis Dei populus, ratae sint.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[41] Besser too is wrong: “the apostle exhorts in these words, that what is stable <span class="ital">with God</span>, be also stable <span class="ital">with us</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm" title="Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:">2 Peter 1:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">σπουδάσατε</span>.

But it seems better to refer <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;</span> to the whole passage (verses 3-9), and to understand <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in its more usual intensive sense, "all the more," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:10</a>, etc. Because God has bestowed such gifts on men, because the use of those gifts leads on to the full knowledge of Christ, therefore all the more give diligence. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "give diligence," recalls the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "all diligence," of verse 5. The aorist seems, as it were, to sum up the continued diligence of daily life into one vivid description. This is the only place in which St. Peter uses the vocative "brethren;" he has "beloved" in the First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1, 8</a>. Both words imply affectionate exhortation. Two ancient manuscripts, the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic, insert here, "Through your good works (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">To make your calling and election sure.</span> Alford calls attention to the middle voice of the verb, "Not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which lay beyond their power, but <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, on their side, for their part. But the verb must not be explained away into a pure subjectivity, 'to make sure to yourselves;' it carries the reflexive force, but only in so far as the act is and must be done for and <span class="accented">quoad</span> a man's own self, the absolute and final determination resting with Another." The calling and election are the act of God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>). All the baptized, all who bear the name of Christ, are called into the Church, but few comparatively are chosen, elect (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>). We look, as it were, from far below up to the mysteries of God's sovereign government; we cannot read the list of blessed names written in the Lamb's book of life; we cannot lift ourselves to a point high enough to comprehend the secrets of God's dealing with mankind, and to reconcile the Divine foreknowledge and omnipotence with the free agency of man. But we feel the energy of that free agency within us; we know that Holy Scripture bids us to work out our salvation, and tells us of some who receive the grace of God in vain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>), or frustrate the grace of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>); and we feel that when  the apostle tells us to make our calling and election sure, he means that we must try to realize that calling and election, to bring its solemn responsibilities and its blessed hopes to bear upon our daily life, to live as men who have been called into God's Church, who are elect unto eternal life, and so (if we may dare to say it) to ratify God's election by our poor acceptance. He calls us into covenant with himself; we answer, as the children of Israel said at Mount Sinai, "All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>). Our obedience makes the covenant sure to us; holiness of life is the proof of God's election, for it implies the indwelling presence of "that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance." <span class="cmt_word">For if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.</span> "If ye do these things;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "If ye make your calling and election sure." "The plural shows that the apostle considered this making sure a very many-sided act" (Dietlein, in Huther). Others refer the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "these things," to the graces just enumerated. <span class="accented">Ye shall never fall</span>; literally, <span class="accented">ye shall never stumble</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "to strike one's foot against some obstacle," and so to stumble. St. James says, "In many things we offend (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). St. Peter here means to stumble so as to fall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>); while Christians "do these things," while they make their calling and election sure by holiness of life, they cannot stumble; it is in unguarded moments that they fall into temptation. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The rather (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The adverb belongs rather with the verb give diligence.
