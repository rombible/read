His thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor His ways as our ways; what seems delay to us is none to Him.<p><span class= "bld">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing.</span>—Although these scoffers are willingly ignorant of what refutes their error, do not you be ignorant of what will lead you to the truth.<p><span class= "bld">One day is with the Lord as a thousand years.</span>—This half of the saying is quite original, and has no equivalent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm" title="For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.">Psalm 90:4</a>. The second half is only partially parallel to “a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday, when it is past.” Consequently, we cannot be sure that the Apostle had this passage from the Psalms in his mind, though it is probable enough that he had. That God Can punish in one day the sins of a thousand years is a thought which is neither in the text nor in the context. What is insisted on is simply this—that distinctions of long and short time are nothing in the sight of God; delay is a purely human conception. Justin Martyr, about A.D. 145 (<span class= "ital">Trypho, </span>lxxxi.), gives “the day of the Lord is as a thousand years” as a quotation, and in this form it is closer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8</a> than to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm" title="For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.">Psalm 90:4</a>. As another possible reference to our Epistle follows in the next chapter, it may be regarded as not improbable that Justin knew the Epistle. (See above, second Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>.) But the saying may have been a favourite one, especially with those who held Millenarian views. In the <span class= "ital">Epistle of Barnabas</span> (xv. 4) we read,” For a day means with Him a thousand years, and He Himself witnesseth, saying, Behold, to-day shall be as a thousand years,” where for “to-day” the <span class= "ital">Codex Sinaiticus</span> reads “the day of the Lord.” Irenæus has “The day of the Lord is as a thousand years” twice—(V. xxiii. 2; xxviii. 3); Hippolytus has it once (<span class= "ital">Comm. on Daniel, </span>Lagarde, p. 153); Methodius once (in Photius’ <span class= "ital">Bibliotheca, </span>cod. 235). In no case, however, is the context at all similar to the verses before us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_peter/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2 Peter 3:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Be not ye ignorant </span>— Whatever they are; <span class="ital">of this one thing </span>— Which casts much light on the point in hand; <span class="ital">that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day </span>— This is an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm" title="For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.">Psalm 90:4</a>, where Moses had said, <span class="ital">A thousand years in thy sight are as one day, </span>which words St. Peter applies with regard to the period intervening between the time when he wrote, and the last day; denoting thereby, 1st, God’s eternity, whereby he exceeds all measure of time in his essence and in his operation: 2d, His knowledge, to which all things past, or to come, are present every moment: 3d, His power, which needs no long delay in order to bring his work to perfection: and, 4th, His long-suffering, which excludes all impatience of expectation and desire of making haste. But it must be observed, that neither the apostle nor the psalmist meant that God does not perceive any difference between the duration of a day and that of a thousand years; but that these differences do not affect either his designs, or actions, or felicity, as they do those of finite creatures. So that what he brings to pass on the day he declares his purpose, is not more certain than what he will bring to pass a thousand years after such declaration. In like manner, what is to be brought to pass a long time after his declaration, is not less certain than if it had been done when declared. See Abernethy’s <span class="ital">Sermon’s, </span>vol. 1. p. 218. The apostle’s meaning is in substance, that in one day, yea, in one moment, he could do the work of a thousand years; therefore he is <span class="ital">not slow, </span>he is always equally able, equally ready to fulfil his promise; <span class="ital">and a thousand years, </span>yea, the longest time, is no more delay to the eternal God <span class="ital">than one day </span>is to us: therefore he is longsuffering; he gives us space for repentance without any inconvenience to himself. In a word, with God time passes neither slower nor swifter than is suitable to him and his economy. Nor can there be any reason why it should be necessary for him either to delay or hasten the end of all things. How can we comprehend this? If we could have comprehended it, St. Peter needed not to have added, <span class="ital">with the Lord.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:5-10 Had these scoffers considered the dreadful vengeance with which God swept away a whole world of ungodly men at once, surely they would not have scoffed at his threatening an equally terrible judgment. The heavens and the earth which now are, by the same word, it is declared, will be destroyed by fire. This is as sure to come, as the truth and the power of God can make it. Christians are here taught and established in the truth of the coming of the Lord. Though, in the account of men, there is a vast difference between one day and a thousand years, yet, in the account of God, there is no difference. All things past, present, and future, are ever before him: the delay of a thousand years cannot be so much to him, as putting off any thing for a day or for an hour is to us. If men have no knowledge or belief of the eternal God, they will be very apt to think him such as themselves. How hard is it to form any thoughts of eternity! What men count slackness, is long-suffering, and that to us-ward; it is giving more time to hisown people, to advance in knowledge and holiness, and in the exercise of faith and patience, to abound in good works, doing and suffering what they are called to, that they may bring glory to God. Settle therefore in your hearts that you shall certainly be called to give an account of all things done in the body, whether good or evil. And let a humble and diligent walking before God, and a frequent judging of yourselves, show a firm belief of the future judgment, though many live as if they were never to give any account at all. This day will come, when men are secure, and have no expectation of the day of the Lord. The stately palaces, and all the desirable things wherein wordly-minded men seek and place their happiness, shall be burned up; all sorts of creatures God has made, and all the works of men, must pass through the fire, which shall be a consuming fire to all that sin has brought into the world, though a refining fire to the works of God's hand. What will become of us, if we set our affections on this earth, and make it our portion, seeing all these things shall be burned up? Therefore make sure of happiness beyond this visible world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years - This <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8-9</a> is the second consideration by which the apostle meets the objection of scoffers against the doctrine of the second coming of the Saviour. The objection was, that much time, and perhaps the time which had been supposed to be set for his coming, had passed away, and still all things remained as they were. The reply of the apostle is, that no argument could be drawn from this, for that which may seem to be a long time to us is a brief period with God. In the infinity of his own duration there is abundant time to accomplish his designs, and it can make no difference with him whether they are accomplished in one day or extended to one thousand years. Man has but a short time to live, and if he does not accomplish his purposes in a very brief period, he never will. But it is not so with God. He always lives; and we cannot therefore infer, because the execution of His purposes seems to be delayed, that they are abandoned. With Him who always lives it will be as easy to accomplish them at a far distant period as now. If it is His pleasure to accomplish them in a single day, He can do it; if He chooses that the execution shall be deferred to one thousand years, or that one thousand years shall be consumed in executing them, He has power to carry them onward through what seems, to us, to be so vast a duration. The wicked, therefore, cannot infer that they will escape because their punishment is delayed; nor should the righteous fear that the divine promises will fail because ages pass away before they are accomplished. The expression here used, that "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, etc.," is common in the Rabbinical writings. See Wetstein in loc. A similar thought occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>; "For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. be not ignorant&#8212;as those scoffers are (2Pe 3:5). Besides the refutation of them (2Pe 3:5-7) drawn from the history of the deluge, here he adds another (addressed more to believers than to the mockers): God's delay in fulfilling His promise is not, like men's delays, owing to inability or fickleness in keeping His word, but through "long-suffering."<p>this one thing&#8212;as the consideration of chief importance (Lu 10:42).<p>one day &#8230; thousand years&#8212;(Ps 90:4): Moses there says, Thy eternity, knowing no distinction between a thousand years and a day, is the refuge of us creatures of a day. Peter views God's eternity in relation to the last day: that day seems to us, short-lived beings, long in coming, but with the Lord the interval is irrespective of the idea of long or short. His eternity exceeds all measures of time: to His divine knowledge all future things are present: His power requires not long delays for the performance of His work: His long-suffering excludes all impatient expectation and eager haste, such as we men feel. He is equally blessed in one day and in a thousand years. He can do the work of a thousand years in one day: so in 2Pe 3:9 it is said, "He is not slack," that is, "slow": He has always the power to fulfil His "promise."<p>thousand years as one day&#8212;No delay which occurs is long to God: as to a man of countless riches, a thousand guineas are as a single penny. God's œonologe (eternal-ages measurer) differs wholly from man's horologe (hour-glass). His gnomon (dial-pointer) shows all the hours at once in the greatest activity and in perfect repose. To Him the hours pass away, neither more slowly, nor more quickly, than befits His economy. There is nothing to make Him need either to hasten or delay the end. The words, "with the Lord" (Ps 90:4, "In Thy sight"), silence all man's objections on the ground of his incapability of understanding this [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Be not ignorant of this one thing; </span> i.e. be sure of it: the same word is here used as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2 Peter 3:5</a></span>; and so he cautions them against the ignorance of scoffers, and to prevent it, would have them certainly know <span class="ital">this one thing, </span> which is extant in the Scripture, which foretells Christ’s coming. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That one day is with the Lord; </span> the Lord Jesus Christ, of whose coming he speaks. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As a thousand years; </span> by a synecdoche, <span class="ital">a thousand years</span> is put for any, even the longest revolution of time; and the sense is, that though there be great difference of time, long and short, with us, who are subject to time, and are measured by it; yet with Him who is eternal, without succession, to whom nothing is past, nothing future, but all things present, there is no difference of time, none long, none short, but a thousand years, nay, all the time that hath run out since the creation of the world, is but as a day; and we are not to judge of the Lord’s delay in coming by our own sense, but by God’s eternity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_peter/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing,.... Here the apostle addresses the saints he writes unto, and for whom he had a tender affection and regard, and for whose welfare he was concerned, lest they should be stumbled at the length of time since the promise of the coming of Christ was given, and which these scoffers object; and therefore he would have them know, observe, and consider this one thing, which might be of great use to them to make their minds easy, and keep up their faith and expectation of the coming of Christ: <p>that one day is, with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day; referring either to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>; or to a common saying among the Jews, founded on the same passage,    , "the day of the holy blessed God is a thousand years" (z); suggesting, that though between thirty and forty years had elapsed since the promise was given out that Christ would come again, and should even a thousand, or two thousand years more, run off, before the coming of Christ, yet this should be no objection to the accomplishment of the promise; for though such a number of years is very considerable among men, ye not "with God", as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions read, with whom a thousand years, and even eternity itself, is but as a day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>. Unless this phrase should be thought to refer, as it is by some, to the day of judgment, and be expressive of the duration of that: it is certain that the Jews interpreted days of millenniums, and reckoned millenniums by days, and used this phrase in confirmation of it. Thus they say (a), <p>"in the time to come, which is in the last days, on the sixth day, which is the sixth millennium, when the Messiah comes, for the day of the holy blessed God is a thousand years.'' <p>And a little after, <p>""the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, a woman shall compass a man". This is in the time of the Messiah which is in the sixth day.'' <p>And elsewhere (b), <p>"the sixth degree is called the sixth day, the day of the holy blessed God is a thousand years. And in that day the King Messiah shall come, and it shall be called the feast of gathering, for the holy blessed God will gather in it the captivity of his people.'' <p>So they call the sabbath, or seventh day, the seventh millennium, and interpret (c). <p>""the song for the sabbath day", <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-1.htm">Psalm 92:1</a> title, for the seventh millennium, for one day of the holy blessed God is a thousand years.'' <p>To which agrees the tradition of Elias, which runs thus (d); <p>"it is the tradition of the house of Elias, that the world shall be six thousand years, two thousand years void (of the law), two thousand years the law, and two thousand years the days of the Messiah;'' <p>for they suppose that the six days of the creation were expressive of the six thousand years in which the world will stand; and that the seventh day prefigures the last millennium, in which will be the day of judgment, and the world to come; for <p>"the six days of the creation (they say (e)) is a sign or intimation of these things: on the sixth day man was created; and on the seventh his work was finished; so the kings of the nations of the world (continue) five millenniums, answering to the five days, in which were created the fowls, and the creeping things of the waters, and other things; and the enjoyment of their kingdom is a little in the sixth, answerable to the creation of the beasts, and living creatures created at this time in the beginning of it; and the kingdom of the house of David is in the sixth millennium, answerable to the creation of man, who knew his Creator, and ruled over them all; and in the end of that millennium will be the day of judgment, answerable to man, who was judged in the end of it; and the seventh is the sabbath, and it is the beginning of the world to come.'' <p>(z) Bereshit Rabba, sect. 8. fol. 7. 3.

The words lay stress on the difference between the divine and the human reckoning of time. It does not designate God as being absolutely without limitations of time (cui nihil est praeteritum, nihil futurum, sed omnia praesentia; Aretius), for it is not the nature of God that is here in question, but God’s reckoning of time which He created along with the world, and the words only bring out that it is different from that of man.[95] For this purpose the words of the Psalms were not sufficient: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΊΛΙΑ ἜΤΗ ἘΝ ὈΦΘΑΛΜΟῖς ΣΟΥ Ὡς Ἡ ἩΜΈΡΑ Ἡ ἘΧΘΈς</span></span></span>; and therefore on the basis of them the author constructs a verse consisting of two members.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡᾺ ΚΥΡΊΟΥ</span></span></span>] “<span class="ital">with God,” i.e.</span> in God’s way of looking at things.

He is long-suffering to usward, not willing that some should perish, but that all should come to repentance. We know not when His long-suffering will be exhausted.

The delay of a millennium may be but as a day in the evolution of the great purposes of God. The words have the additional interest of having impressed themselves as a “faithful saying” or axiom of religious thought on the minds of the apostolic age, and are quoted as such in the Epistle that bears the name of Barnabas (chap. 15).

The sum of Peter’s words is, the <span class="ital">age-measurer</span> (so to speak) of God differs from the <span class="ital">hour-reckoner</span> of mortals. His gnomon[20] shows at once all hours in the greatest activity and in the greatest repose. To Him the times pass away neither more slowly nor more quickly than is befitting to Him and to His economy. There is no reason why He should consider it needful either to delay or to hasten the end. How shall we understand this? If we were able to understand it, there would be no occasion for Moses and Peter to add, <span class="ital">with the Lord</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[20] Gnomon properly denotes the pin of a sun-dial.—T.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">let not this one thing escape you</span>, as especially important. <span class="cmt_word">That one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span> "With the Lord" means in his sight, in his estimate of things (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>, "A thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday"). Bengel finely says, "Dei aeoniologium (sic appellare liceat) differt ab horologic mortalium. Illius gnomon omnes homis simul indicat in summa actione et in summa quiete. Ei nec tardius nec celerius labuntur tempera quam ipsi et oeconomiae ejus aptum sit. Nulls causa est cur finem rerum aut protelare aut accelerare necessum habeat. Qui hoc comprehendemus? Si comprehendere possemus, non opus foret a Mose et Petro addi, apud Dominum." God is eternal: his thought is not, like ours, subject to the law of time; and even we can understand that one day, as the day of the Saviour's death, may have far more of intense action compressed into it, and far more influence upon the spiritual destiny of mankind, than any period of a thousand years. This passage seems to be quoted by Justin Martyr, the 'Epistle of Barnabas,' Irenaeus, and Hippolytus; but they may be referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, though the quotations resemble the words of St. Peter more closely than those of the psalm. </body></html>
