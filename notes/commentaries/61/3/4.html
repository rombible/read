Four answers have been given to this question: (1) The ancestors of the human race; (2) the patriarchs and prophets; (3) the first generation of Christians; (4) each generation of men in relation to those following. Probably nothing more definite than our remote ancestors is intended. The expression “fell asleep” is used of St. Stephen’s death in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.">Acts 7:60</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-52.htm" title="And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,">Matthew 27:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-39.htm" title="The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.">1Corinthians 7:39</a>, where the word is not literally translated; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1Corinthians 15:18</a>, &c). The thoroughly Christian term “cemetery” (=sleeping-place), in the sense of a place of repose for the <span class= "ital">dead, </span>comes from the same Greek root.<p>There is a passage quoted by Clement of Rome (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> A.D. 100) which seems at first sight to contain a reference to this verse: “Far be from us this Scripture where He saith, Wretched are the double-minded, who doubt in heart and say, <span class= "ital">These things we heard in the times of our fathers also, but behold, we have grown old, and none of them has happened to us</span>” (<span class= "ital">Epistle to the Corinthians, </span>xxiii.). But the remainder of this “Scripture,” as quoted by Clement, is so utterly unlike the verse before us, that one suspects some other source. And this suspicion is confirmed when we find the same passage quoted in the so-called <span class= "ital">Second Epistle of Clement</span> (xi.) as “the prophetic word.” (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a> and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-9.htm" title="The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:">2Peter 2:9</a>). The differences between the two quotations are such that the pseudo-Clement appears to be quoting independently, and not merely borrowing from the true Clement. In neither case does close inspection encourage us to believe that our present verse is the source of the quotation. But the quotation by the true Clement is important as a complete refutation of the objection that “the fathers” means the first Christians, and consequently no such scoffing argument as this would be possible in the lifetime of St. Peter This very argument was not only in existence, but was condemned in a document which Clement before the close of the first century could quote as “Scripture.” Comp. <span class= "ital">Epistle of Poly carp, </span>chap. vii.: “Whosoever perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts, and says there is neither resurrection nor judgment, he is the firstborn of Satan.”<p><span class= "bld">All things continue as they were.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">as they are.</span> The error has probably arisen from a desire to get rid of the slight difficulty of <span class= "ital">two</span> dates being given: (1) from the death of “the fathers,” and (2) from the beginning of the creation. The suggestion that “the fathers” are the first progenitors of the human race is another attempt to get rid of the difficulty by making the two dates virtually one and the same. But the second date is an after-thought, frequent in Thucydides, intensifying and strengthening the first. <span class= "ital">Since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they are</span>—nay, more, <span class= "ital">since the beginning of the creation.</span><p>This sceptical argument is used with increased force as each generation passes away.

We see no sign of any such thing. The promise of Christ’s coming we have <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm" title="And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.">Matthew 15:27</a>, <span class="ital">The Son of man shall come in his glory, </span>&c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>, <span class="ital">I will come and receive you to myself, </span>&c., and in many other passages of the gospel; a promise which was renewed by the angels at our Lord’s ascension, and is spoken of in many passages of the epistles, especially in those of St. Paul. By representing Christ’s promised coming as a delusion, the scoffers set themselves and others free from all fear of a future judgment, and bereft the righteous of their hope of reward. <span class="ital">For since the fathers fell asleep </span>— Since our ancestors died; <span class="ital">all things </span>— Heaven, earth, air, water; <span class="ital">continue as they were from the beginning of the creation </span>— Without any such material change as might make us believe they will ever have an end. So say these scoffers. <span class="ital">For this they willingly are ignorant of </span>— As if he had said, It is from their ignorance, their gross, affected ignorance, that they argue after this manner. He says <span class="ital">willingly ignorant, </span>to signify that they had sufficient means of knowing better, but that they did not care to know or consider any thing respecting it. <span class="ital">That by the word of God </span>— His almighty word, which bounds the duration of all things, so that it cannot be either longer or shorter; <span class="ital">the heavens </span>— As by the heavens here the apostle means the atmosphere which surrounds this earth, the plural is put for the singular by a change of the number very common in the Scriptures; <span class="ital">were of old </span>— Anciently before the flood; <span class="ital">and the earth standing </span>— Or <span class="ital">subsisting, </span>(as <span class="greekheb">συνεστωσα </span>more properly signifies,) <span class="ital">out of the water </span>— Which had before covered it, namely, emerging from it by the divine command, (the earth being formed out of the chaos, which had been previously brought into existence for that purpose,) and the liquid element retiring to the channels prepared for it; <span class="ital">and in the water </span>— By which God appointed that it should be surrounded, nourished, and supported, water being the life of the vegetable creation; <span class="ital">whereby </span>— <span class="greekheb">Δι</span>’ <span class="greekheb">ων</span>, <span class="ital">by which things, </span>thus constituted; <span class="ital">the world that then was </span>— The whole antediluvian race, with all the brute animals, except such as were with Noah in the ark; <span class="ital">being overflowed with water, perished </span>— Perhaps <span class="greekheb">δι</span>’ <span class="greekheb">ων</span>, <span class="ital">by which things, </span>refers to the heavens mentioned above, and may relate to <span class="ital">the windows of heaven being opened, </span>as the expression is <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm" title="In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.">Genesis 7:11</a>, and pouring forth upon the earth a destructive deluge of water. The apostle means that these scoffers did not consider God’s power manifested in making the world, which must enable him also to destroy it if he pleased, and that they had little reason for saying that all things continued as they were from the creation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 The purified minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may be active and lively in the work of holiness. There will be scoffers in the last days, under the gospel, men who make light of sin, and mock at salvation by Jesus Christ. One very principal article of our faith refers to what only has a promise to rest upon, and scoffers will attack it till our Lord is come. They will not believe that he will come. Because they see no changes, therefore they fear not God, Ps 55:19. What he never has done, they fancy he never can do, or never will do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? - That is, either, Where is the "fulfillment" of that promise; or, Where are the "indications" or "signs" that he will come? They evidently meant to imply that the promise had utterly failed; that there was not the slightest evidence that it would be accomplished; that they who had believed this were entirely deluded. It is possible that some of the early Christians, even in the time of the apostles, had undertaken to fix the time when these events would occur, as many have done since; and that as that time had passed by, they inferred that the prediction had utterly failed. But whether this were so or not, it was easy to allege that the predictions respecting the second coming of the "Saviour" seemed to imply that the end of the world was near, and that there were no indications that they would be fulfilled. The laws of nature were uniform, as they had always been, and the alleged promises had failed.<p>For since the fathers fell asleep - Since they "died" - death being often, in the Scriptures, as elsewhere, represented as sleep. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a> note. This reference to the "fathers," by such scoffers, was probably designed to be ironical and contemptuous. Perhaps the meaning may be thus expressed: "Those old men, the prophets, indeed foretold this event. They were much concerned and troubled about it; and their predictions alarmed others, and filled their bosoms with dread. They looked out for the signs of the end of the world, and expected that that day was drawing near. But those good men have died. They lived to old age, and then died as others; and since they have departed, the affairs of the world have gone on very much as they did before. The earth is suffered to have rest, and the laws of nature operate in the same way that they always did." It seems not improbable that the immediate reference in the word "fathers" is not to the prophets of former times, but to aged and pious men of the times of the apostles, who had dwelt much on this subject, and who had made it a subject of conversation and of preaching. Those old men, said the seeing objector, have died like others; and, notwithstanding their confident predictions, things now move on as they did from the beginning.<p>All things continue as they were, from the beginning of the creation - That is, the laws of nature are fixed and settled. The argument here - for it was doubtless designed to be an argument - is based on the stability of the laws of nature, and the uniformity of the course of events. Thus far, all these predictions had failed. Things continued to go on as they had always done. The sun rose and set; the tides ebbed and flowed; the seasons followed each other in the usual order; one generation succeeded another, as had always been the case; and there was every indication that those laws would continue to operate as they had always done. This argument for the stability of the earth, and against the prospect of the fulfillment of the predictions of the Bible, would have more force with many minds now than it had then, for 1,800 years (circa 1880's) more have rolled away, and the laws of nature remain the same. Meantime, the expectations of those who have believed that the world was coming to an end have been disappointed; the time set for this by many interpreters of Scripture has passed by; men have looked out in vain for the coming of the Saviour, and sublunary affairs move on as they always have done. Still there are no indications of the coming of the Saviour; and perhaps it would be said that the farther men search, by the aid of science, into the laws of nature, the more they become impressed with their stability, and the more firmly they are convinced of the improbability that the world will be destroyed in the manner in which it is predicted in the Scriptures that it will be. The specious and plausible objection arising from this source, the apostle proposes to meet in the following verses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. (Compare Ps 10:11; 73:11.) Presumptuous skepticism and lawless lust, setting nature and its so-called laws above the God of nature and revelation, and arguing from the past continuity of nature's phenomena that there can be no future interruption to them, was the sin of the antediluvians, and shall be that of the scoffers in the last days.<p>Where&#8212;implying that it ought to have taken place before this, if ever it was to take place, but that it never will.<p>the promise&#8212;which you, believers, are so continually looking for the fulfilment of (2Pe 3:13).

From the time of the promise of Christ's coming as Saviour and King being given to the fathers, down to the present time, all things continue, and have continued, as they now are, from "the beginning of creation." The "scoffers" here are not necessarily atheists, nor do they maintain that the world existed from eternity. They are willing to recognize a God, but not the God of revelation.

Gerhard assumes that the scoffers did not mention the name of Christ per <span class="greekheb">ἐξουθενισμόν</span>; thus also Wiesinger, Hofmann. According to the connection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-2.htm" title="That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:">2 Peter 3:2</a>), the <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελία</span> meant is that of the O. T. (cf. chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2 Peter 1:19</a> ff.[87]). In what follows we have the thesis of the scoffers in opposition to the <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελία</span>, and the basis of it. The thesis is: <span class="greekheb">πάντα οὕτως διαμένει ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς κτίσεως</span>; its basis is indicated by the words: <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς</span> (<span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμέρας</span>) <span class="greekheb">οἱ πατέρες ἐκοιμήθησαν</span>. On the assumption that the <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς οἱ πατ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκοιμ</span>., as used by the scoffers, means the period marking off the commencement of the <span class="greekheb">διαμένει</span>, and that <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κτ</span>. serves only as a more precise definition of it (Brückner, Schott), then by <span class="greekheb">οἱ πατέρες</span> must be understood “the ancestors, the first generations of the human race.” But on this view <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is an entirely superfluous determination (Wiesinger), nor would there thus be any indication of the ground on which the scoffers based their thesis; if, however, this be contained in <span class="greekheb">ὀφʼ ἧς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., the reference in <span class="greekheb">οἱ πατέρες</span> can be only either to the fathers of the Jewish people, to whom the <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελία</span> was given, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a> (Wiesinger), or those of the generation to which the scoffers belong (de Wette, Thiersch, Fronmüller, Hofmann). Now, since the falling asleep of the fathers of Israel, before its fulfilment, could not well be brought as a proof that the promise was of none effect, inasmuch as it referred to a time beyond that in which they lived (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1 Peter 1:10</a> ff.), preference must be given to the second view. Wiesinger, indeed, says that the time of the composition of the epistle does not agree with this; but as the tarrying of the <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span> had already been the occasion of wonder in the church, and Christianity, when this letter was composed, had now been in existence for at least thirty-five years, it is quite possible that even at <span class="ital">that time</span> those who held Libertine views could have supported their denial of the Parousia by the fact that the expectation cherished by the early Christians had remained unrealized, thus calling forth the prophecy here made. At any rate, it is a point not to be overlooked, that the words here used are represented as to be spoken at a time then still in the future. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2 Peter 3:8</a>, which otherwise would stand totally unconnected with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2 Peter 3:4</a>, also favours this view.[88] The connection of the two members of the verse is certainly a loose one, since on none of the different interpretations does <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. stand in close connection with <span class="greekheb">διαμένει</span>. The thought which has been somewhat inadequately expressed is: Since the fathers fell asleep, nothing has changed,—the promise has not been fulfilled,—a proof that everything remains as it has been since the creation. With <span class="greekheb">ἐκοιμήθησαν</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-39.htm" title="The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>, and other passages.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> does not require any supplement properly so called: “the scoffers point as it were with the finger to the (sacred) <span class="ital">status quo</span> of the world” (Steinfass).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διαμένει</span> does not mean “has remained,” nor is it “will remain,” but the present expresses the continuous, uniform duration; <span class="greekheb">δια</span> strengthens the idea <span class="greekheb">μένειν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς κτίσεως</span>: “since creation took its beginning.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[87] This Hofmann disputes, saying: “by the promise is not to be understood the Old Testament promise, nor by the future the future of Christ, since those who speak thus are members of the Christian church; but with respect to the Old Testament prophecy, they speak of Jehovah’s coming, and, with respect to Christ’s prophecy, of His own coming, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπαγγελία τῆς παρουσίας τοῦ κυρίου</span> might comprehend the one as well as the other;” the context, however, is in favour of the interpretation which Hofmann disputes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[88] Dietlein’s interpretation is altogether wrong. According to it, <span class="greekheb">οἱ πατέρες</span> means: “One generation after another always standing in the relation of fathers to the race succeeding it.” Peculiar, but certainly quite unjustifiable, is the opinion of Steinfass, that the scoffers, with reference to the promise contained in the Book of Enoch, understood <span class="greekheb">οἱ πατέρες</span> to mean “the prophetical, or more definitely, the eschatological patriarchs, beginning with Enoch and extending down to Daniel.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_peter/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2 Peter 3:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ποῦ ἐστὶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The coming or our Lord in the near future was evidently an integral part of the apostolic teaching, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2 Peter 1:16</a>. “There is no sure evidence that Jesus sought to undermine the assumption of His followers, that the and glory would be manifested in their day; and even this we may fairly qualify with the remembrance that a main motive of the principal eschatological discourse, reported by the Synoptists, is to warn the disciples against premature expectations” (J.H. Muirhead, <span class="ital">Eschatology of Jesus</span>, pp. 126, 127). <span class="greekheb">τῆς παρουσίας</span>: See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2 Peter 1:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς γὰρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. “The fathers,” must mean those of the preceding generation, in whose life-time the <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span> was expected. <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> = <span class="ital">in statu quo.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς κτίσεως</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “contrary to all previous human experience”. The Teaching of our Lord Himself in one aspect would imply that the actual <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span>, would be attended with no outward previous disturbance of life to act as a warning. Men would be engaged in their ordinary occupations and pleasures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only....">Matthew 24:36-42</a>). The development and ripening of the moral and spiritual issues of men’s lives are often not outwardly apparent (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Paget’s “<span class="ital">Studies in the Christian Character</span>,”—“<span class="ital">The Hidden Issues</span>,” pp. 89 ff).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_peter/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">Where is the promise of his coming?</span>] The question indicates the comparatively late date of the Epistle. St James had spoken (probably a. d. 50) of the Judge as standing at the door; St Paul had written twice as if he expected to be living on the earth when the Judge should come (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>), and yet He came not. Men began to think that the Coming was a delusion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for since the fathers fell asleep</span>] Ordinarily, the “fathers,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 9:5</a>, would carry our thoughts back to the great progenitors of Israel as a people. Here, however, the stress laid by the mockers on the death of the fathers as the starting-point of the frustrated expectation, seems to give the word another application, and we may see in the “fathers” the first generation of the disciples of Christ, those who had “fallen asleep” without seeing the Advent they had looked for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>); those who had reached the “end of their conversation” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm" title="Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.">Hebrews 13:7</a>). The scoffers appealed to the continuity of the natural order of things. Seed-time and harvest, summer and winter, followed as they had done from the beginning of the creation. In the last phrase we may trace an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-6.htm" title="But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.">Mark 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-19.htm" title="For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time, neither shall be.">Mark 13:19</a>. “You have told us,” they seem to have said, “of an affliction such as there has not been from the beginning of the creation, and lo! we find the world still goes on as of old, with no great catastrophe.” The answer to the sneer St Peter gives himself, but it may be noted that the question of the scoffers at least implies the early date of the writings in which the expectation of the Coming is prominent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the use of the verb to “fall asleep” for dying, we are reminded of our Lord’s words “Our friend Lazarus sleepeth” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>); of St Paul’s “many sleep” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>). So in Greek sculpture Death and Sleep appear as twin genii, and in Greek and Roman epitaphs nothing is more common than the record that the deceased “sleeps” below. Too often there is the addition, as of those who were without hope, “sleeps an eternal sleep.” In Christian language the idea of sleep is perpetuated in the term “cemetery” (<span class="greekheb">κοιμητήριον</span> = sleeping-place) as applied to the burial-place of the dead, but it is blended with that of an “awaking out of sleep” at the last day, and even with the thought, at first seemingly incompatible with it, that the soul is quickened into higher energies of life on its entrance into the unseen world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2 Peter 3:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ποῦ ἔστιν</span>, <span class="ital">where is?</span>) They think, either that it ought already to have taken place, or that it never will take place. This is also their meaning when they say, <span class="ital">all things continue as they were</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπαγγελία</span>, <span class="ital">the promise</span>) Mockers thus term it, not in respect of themselves, but in mimicry,[17] because the righteous earnestly desire the fulfilment of the <span class="ital">promise</span>.—<span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">of Him</span>) Of the coming Lord, whom they disdain to mention by name.—<span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς</span>) (<span class="greekheb">ἡμέρας</span>), <span class="ital">from the day in which</span>.—<span class="greekheb">οἱ πατέρες</span>, <span class="ital">the fathers</span>) who rested their hopes on the promise.—<span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>, <span class="ital">all things</span>) the heaven, the water, the earth.—<span class="greekheb">οὕτω</span>, <span class="ital">thus</span>) An adverb of pregnant meaning; that is, thus continue, as they do continue.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς κτίσεως</span>, <span class="ital">from the beginning of the creation</span>) These mockers at any rate confess, that the world did not exist from eternity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[17] See Append. on MIMESIS.—E.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>, "Where is the God of judgment?"). The Lord had prophesied of his coming; St. Paul had spoken more than once as if that coming were very near at hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). Yet he came not. Already men were beginning to mock, and to question whether the long-delayed promise  would ever be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">For since the fathers fell asleep;</span> better, <span class="accented">from the day that.</span> By "the fathers" must be meant here the fathers of the Christian Church. St. Peter was writing more than thirty years after the Ascension. The first generation of Christians was rapidly passing away. Stephen "fell asleep" first, then James the son of Zebedee, the other James the Lord's brother, and many others who had looked, it may be, to see the coming of the Lord among those "which are alive and remain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>). But they had died, and he came not; and from the day of their death things went on as they were. Should men look for him still, the mockers asked, when the fathers looked in vain? The mockers adopted, in mockery, doubtless, the Christian phrase for death. The Lord first had said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ;" then the holy Stephen "fell asleep;" and so "they which are asleep" became the recognized name for the dead in Christ. Death is like sleep; the holy dead rest from their labours. They "sleep not idly," for they are at home with the Lord, and they are blessed; but yet the quiet rest of Paradise, though "far better" than this earthly life, is sleep compared with the perfect consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, which the redeemed of the Lord shall enjoy at last in his eternal glory. <span class="cmt_word">All things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation;</span> literally, <span class="accented">all things continue thus</span>, as they are, and as they have been from the beginning. There has been no sudden catastrophe; the world has gone on as it was; the laws of nature are still working with their changeless uniformity" (see a remarkable parallel in Clement, I, 23, which is important also as an independent proof that this argument of the scoffers is as old as the end of the first century). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>From the beginning of the creation (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;' &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Not a common phrase.

Some have supposed that the peculiarly Christian sense of the word is emphasized ironically by these mockers. It is used, however, in classical Greek to denote death. The difference between the pagan and the Christian usage lies in the fact that, in the latter, it was defined by the hope of the resurrection, and therefore was used literally of a sleep, which, though long, was to have an awaking.
