(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-17.htm" title="But, beloved, remember you the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;">Jude 1:17</a>.)

In this verse the Apostle commends the warnings of the Old Testament and the New Testament, as to the coming of Christ, to Christians throughout all ages.<p><span class= "bld">The commandment of us the apostles of the Lord.</span>—“Of us” is, beyond all doubt, a false reading; it should be “of you,” or “your.” The Greek is somewhat awkward, owing to the number of genitives, but the order of the words is conclusive as to the meaning—<span class= "ital">the commandment of your Apostles</span> (or rather) <span class= "ital">of the Lord and Saviour.</span> The commandment is at once a commandment of the Apostles and of the Lord. “The Apostles of the Lord” must not be taken together, as in our version. The expression “your Apostles” may be taken as a mark of genuineness rather than of the contrary. It is at least not improbable that a true Apostle, having once stated his credentials (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>), would sink his own personality in the group of his colleagues from a feeling of humility and of delicacy towards those whom he was addressing, especially when they owed their Christianity mainly to other Apostles than himself. It is not improbable that a writer personating an Apostle would have insisted on his assumed personality and personal authority here.<p>What commandment is meant? Surely not the whole Christian law; but either the command to beware of false teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-15.htm" title="Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.">Matthew 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-5.htm" title="For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.">Matthew 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-11.htm" title="And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.">Matthew 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm" title="For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.">Mark 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-17.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them.">Romans 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm" title="Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God on the children of disobedience.">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-3.htm" title="For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;">2Timothy 4:3</a>), or, more probably, what is the main subject of this Epistle, to be ready for Christ’s coming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.">Matthew 24:36-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-35.htm" title="Watch you therefore: for you know not when the master of the house comes, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:">Mark 13:35-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-40.htm" title="Be you therefore ready also: for the Son of man comes at an hour when you think not.">Luke 12:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2-4</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 The purified minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may be active and lively in the work of holiness. There will be scoffers in the last days, under the gospel, men who make light of sin, and mock at salvation by Jesus Christ. One very principal article of our faith refers to what only has a promise to rest upon, and scoffers will attack it till our Lord is come. They will not believe that he will come. Because they see no changes, therefore they fear not God, Ps 55:19. What he never has done, they fancy he never can do, or never will do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That ye may be mindful of the words - Of the doctrines, the truths; the prophetic statements. Jude Jde 1:18 says that it had been foretold by the apostles, that in the last days there would be scoffers. Peter refers to the instructions of the apostles and prophets in general, though evidently designing that his remarks should bear particularly on the fact that there would be scoffers.<p>Which were spoken before by the holy prophets - The predictions of the prophets before the advent of the Saviour, respecting his character and work. Peter had before appealed to them <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19-21</a>, as furnishing important evidence in regard to the truth of the Christian religion, and valuable instruction in reference to its nature. See the notes at that passage. Many of the most important doctrines respecting the kingdom of the Messiah are stated as clearly in the Old Testament as in the New Testament (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>), and the prophecies therefore deserve to be studied as an important part of divine revelation. It should be added here, however, that when Peter wrote there was this special reason why he referred to the prophets, that the canon of the New Testament was not then completed, and he could not make his appeal to that. To some parts of the writings of Paul he could and did appeal <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15-16</a>, but probably a very small part of what is now the New Testament was known to those to whom this epistle was addressed.<p>And of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour - As being equally entitled with the prophets to state and enforce the doctrines and duties of religion. It may be observed, that no man would have used this language who did not regard himself and his fellow apostles as inspired, and as on a level with the prophets. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. prophets&#8212;of the Old Testament.<p>of us&#8212;The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read, "And of the commandment of the Lord and Saviour (declared) by YOUR apostles" (so "apostle of the Gentiles," Ro 11:13)&#8212;the apostles who live among you in the present time, in contrast to the Old Testament "prophets."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The words which were spoken before by the holy prophets; </span> the <span class="ital">word of prophecy, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2 Peter 1:19</a></span>: he joins the prophets and apostles together, as concurring in their doctrine, and so useth it as an argument to persuade them to constancy in the faith of the gospel, that what the apostles preached to them was confirmed by what the prophets under the Old Testament had taught before, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-22.htm" title="Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:">Acts 26:22</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And of the commandment of us; </span> by this he means the whole doctrine of the gospel preached by him and the other apostles: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-21.htm" title="For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.">2 Peter 2:21</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1Jo 3:23</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The apostles of the Lord and Saviour; </span> who was the author of this commandment, and the principal in giving it, and from whom the apostles received it, who were but ministers and instruments in delivering it to others. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_peter/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That ye may be mindful,.... This is an explanation of the above mentioned end of his writing this and the other epistle; which was, that those saints might be mindful of two things more especially: <p>of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets; that is, the prophets of the Old Testament, who were holy men of God, and therefore their words are to be regarded, and retained in memory; the Gospel itself was spoken by them, and so was Christ, and the things relating to his person and offices, and to his incarnation, sufferings, and death, and the glory that should follow; and indeed the apostles said no other than what they did, only more clearly and expressly; and particularly many things, were said by them concerning the second coming of Christ to judge the world, and destroy it, and to prepare new heavens and a new earth for his people, which is what the apostle has chiefly in view; see Jde 1:14; <p>and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour; that is, Jesus Christ, as Jde 1:17 expresses it, and the Ethiopic version adds here; and which likewise, and also the Syriac version, and some ancient copies, read, "our Lord and Saviour", and omit the us before the apostles; by whom are meant the twelve apostles of Christ, of which Peter was one, and therefore says, "us the apostles"; though the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions, and the Complutensian edition, read "your apostles", and so the Alexandrian copy; but the former is the received reading: now "the commandment" of these intends either the Gospel in general, so called because it was the commandment of our Lord to his apostles to preach it; and therefore the word "commandment", in the original, stands between "us the apostles", and "the Lord and Saviour", as being the commandment of the one to the other; unless it can be thought any regard is had to the new commandment of love, or that of faith, inculcated both by Christ and his apostles; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>; or rather, particularly the instructions, directions, and predictions of the apostles concerning the second coming of Christ, and what should go before it, as appears from the following words, and the parallel place in Jde 1:17, the words of the prophets and apostles being here put together, show the agreement there is between them, and what regard is to be had to each of them, and to anything and every thing in which they agree. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_peter/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_peter/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-2.htm" title="That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:">2 Peter 3:2</a>.

Others, again, hold that <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> is dependent on <span class="greekheb">ἀποστόλων</span>; thus de Wette: “the commandment of our apostles of the Lord, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of the apostles who have preached to us, and are sent from the Lord.” But against this interpretation is the circumstance, that whilst he elsewhere in the epistle designates himself as an apostle, the author of the epistle would thus make a distinction between himself and the apostles.[85] On the true reading: <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, the gen. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κυρίου</span> does not, as was for the most part formerly assumed, depend on <span class="greekheb">ἀποστόλων</span>, but on <span class="greekheb">ἐντολῆς</span> (Brückner, Wiesinger, Schott, Steinfass); either in the sense: “the commandment … of the Lord of the apostles, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the commandment of the Lord, which the apostles have proclaimed;” or: “<span class="greekheb">τοῦ κυρίου</span> is added by way of supplement to <span class="greekheb">ἐντολ</span>.,” and the expression is to be left as it stands originally: “<span class="ital">your command of the apostles, of the Lord</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">which the Lord has given</span>” (Brückner; thus also Wiesinger, Schott); the latter is to be preferred. No doubt the parallel passage in Jude runs: <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ τῶν ἀποστόλων τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν</span>; but the whole epistle, and especially this passage of it, shows that the author of our epistle, even if he had Jude’s composition before him, in no way bound himself slavishly to individual expressions in it. According to Wiesinger, Schott, Steinfass, by the <span class="greekheb">ἀπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. Paul and his fellow-labourers are meant; this, too, is more probable than that the apostle included himself among them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> is here, as little as in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-21.htm" title="For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.">2 Peter 2:21</a>, to be understood the gospel or the Christian religion (or, as Dietlein thinks: “the announcement, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the historical proclamation, of those predictions of the prophets, partly fulfilled, partly yet unfulfilled, which was entrusted to the apostles”); but <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> means here, as it always does, the commandment; according to de Wette: “the commandment to guard against the false teachers,” after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a> ff. But it is more appropriate, and more in harmony with the connection of thought, to understand by it the command to lead a Christian life, in expectation of the second coming of Christ (Wiesinger, Schott, Brückner); cf. chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-22.htm" title="But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.">2 Peter 2:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2 Peter 1:5</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2 Peter 3:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[84] Of course <span class="greekheb">τὰ προειρημένα ῥήματα</span> does not mean “what has been said before,” but “the words aforetime spoken,” and Hofmann did not require to insist upon it; the more so that the contrary is not asserted in the commentaries against which his argument is directed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[85] De Wette thinks, indeed, that here the non-apostolic writer has involuntarily betrayed himself; but, as Stier justly observes, it can indeed hardly be supposed that the writer should have “so grossly failed to keep up the part” which he had distinctly assumed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_peter/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-2.htm" title="That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:">2 Peter 3:2</a>.

Great stress is laid on the word of prophecy in both Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>). And of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles.</span> All the best manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> here. It is a remarkable expression; but Christ's apostles can be rightly called the apostles of those to whom they are sent, as being their teachers, sent to them for their benefit; just as the angels of God are called also the angels of Christ's little ones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a>). Compare also "the angels of the seven Churches" in the Revelation. St. Peter shows an intimate knowledge of several of St. Paul's Epistles, and of that of St. James; he is writing to the Churches addressed in his First Epistle, most of which were founded by St. Paul or his companions. We must therefore understand this passage, as well as verse 15 of this chapter, as a distinct recognition of the apostleship of St. Paul. The translation of the Authorized Version, "the apostles of the Lord and Saviour," involves a violent disturbance of the order; it seems best to make both genitives depend on "commandment:" "your apostles' commandment of the Lord;" the first genitive being that of announcement, the second of origin. The commandment was announced by the apostles, but it was the Lord's commandment. (For the double genitive, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>. For the whole verse, see the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-17.htm">Jude 1:17</a>.) </body></html>
