The words are an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm" title="But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.">Matthew 24:43</a>, a saying which St. Peter certainly heard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>), or possibly of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>, which may easily be included in the Epistles referred to below in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2Peter 3:16</a>. The words “in the night” are here wanting in authority.<p><span class= "bld">The heavens shall pass away.</span>—Again an apparent reminiscence of the discourse in Matthew 24 (where comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.">Matthew 24:35</a>)—the third such reminiscence in this chapter (see preceding Note, and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm" title="But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved to fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.">2Peter 3:7</a>). This repeated reproduction of words and ideas from one of the most impressive of Christ’s discourses, which only St. Peter and three others seem to have heard, may fairly be added to the evidence in favour of the authenticity of the Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">With a great noise.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">with a rushing noise.</span> The expression occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but some such idea as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm" title="And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.">Revelation 6:14</a>, is probably indicated—not the roar of flames or the crash of ruins, but the parting and rolling up of the heavens. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The elements shall melt with fervent heat.</span>—The meaning of “elements” here is much disputed. (See Notes on the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>.) The difficulty of supposing fire to be destroyed by fire seems to exclude the four elements being intended; moreover, the earth is mentioned separately. Hence, some take “the elements” to mean water and air, the two remaining elements; but this is not very satisfactory. More probably, the various forms of matter in the universe are intended, without any thought of indicating what they are precisely. But seeing that Justin Martyr calls the sun, moon, and stars “heavenly elements” (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> II. v., <span class= "ital">Trypho, </span>xxiii.), and that in predictions of the last day frequent mention is made of “signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-24.htm" title="But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,">Mark 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm" title="And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;">Luke 21:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm" title="Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-31.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.">Joel 2:31</a>, &c), it is possible that the heavenly bodies are meant here, all the more so, as the mention of these “elements” immediately follows that of the heavens. Bengel (perhaps with more poetry than correctness) ingeniously connects this explanation with the radical signification of the word, viz., “letters of the alphabet,” “for stars in the heaven are as letters on a scroll.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm" title="And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.">Revelation 6:14</a>.) “Shall melt” should rather be, as in the next two verses, <span class= "ital">shall be dissolved.</span> Wiclif has “dissolved,” Rheims “resolved.” This dissolution is the opposite of the consistency spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2Peter 3:5</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2Peter 3:12</a> “melt” is correct, and suits the heavenly bodies better than the four elements. (Comp. <span class= "ital">The Second Epistle of Clement, </span>xvi. 3.)<p><span class= "bld">The earth also and the works that are therein.</span>—Equivalent to “the earth and the fulness thereof,” “works” being used in a comprehensive sense for products both of nature and art. The moral work of each individual is not meant; consequently, a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1Corinthians 3:13</a> is misleading. The two passages have little in common, and nothing is gained by bringing in the difficulties of the other passage here. In this passage the Apostle is stating plainly and in detail what some of the Prophets of the Old Testament had set forth in general and sometimes obscure language—that a judgment by fire is in store for the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/66-15.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-24.htm" title="And they shall go forth, and look on the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.">Isaiah 66:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm" title="For, behold, the day comes, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yes, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes shall burn them up, said the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.">Malachi 4:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Shall be burned up.</span>—The question of readings here is one of known difficulty. One important MS. has “shall vanish away” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-14.htm" title="Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.">James 4:14</a>); two first-rate MSS. and other authorities have “shall be found.” The later Syriac has “shall not be found,” which is pretty nearly equivalent to “shall vanish away,” and is sometimes given as exactly equivalent to it. “Shall be found,” the reading most strongly attested, is summarily rejected by some editors as yielding no sense. The theory that it has grown out of the Latin for “shall be burned up”—<span class= "ital">eurethesetai</span> out of <span class= "ital">exurentur</span>—does not seem very probable. Nor is it true that it yields no sense By placing a colon at “also,” and making what follows a question, we obtain—<span class= "ital">The elements shall be dissolved, the earth also: and shall the works that are therein be found?</span> Happily, nothing of importance turns on the reading; all the variations amount practically to the same thing—that the elements, the earth, and all that is in it, shall be destroyed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_peter/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2 Peter 3:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">But </span>— Notwithstanding the long-suffering of God; <span class="ital">the day of the Lord </span>— The day of the consummation of all things, and of final judgment; <span class="ital">will come, </span>and that <span class="ital">as a thief in the night </span>— Because thieves commonly break into houses in the nighttime, and occasion great fear to those who are within, any sudden, unexpected event, especially such as occasioned terror, was compared, by the Hebrews, to the coming of a thief in the night. The suddenness, therefore, and unexpectedness of the coming of the day of the Lord, and the terror which it will occasion to the wicked, are the circumstances in which it will resemble the coming of a thief, and not that it will happen in the night-time. <span class="ital">In the which the heavens </span>— That is, the aerial heavens, the atmosphere which surrounds this earth, and which the apostle calls <span class="ital">the heavens, </span>because Moses had called it so; <span class="ital">shall pass away </span>— The passing away of the heavens and the earth does not mean, it seems, that they will be removed to another part of space, or that they will be annihilated; but that, being burned, their form and constitution will be changed much more, probably, than the constitution or form of the old world was by the flood; destruction by fire being more complete and dreadful than destruction by water; <span class="ital">with a great noise </span>— Surprisingly expressed by the very sound of the original word, <span class="greekheb">ροιζηδον</span>. “That the thundering noise occasioned by the burning of the whole heavens, or atmosphere, will be terrible beyond description, may be conjectured by considering what a noise is made by those small portions of the air which are burned when it thunders, or which are set in commotion in a storm.” But how much greater will be the noise arising from the general conflagration of the whole earth, with all that it contains. <span class="ital">And the elements shall melt with fervent heat </span>— <span class="greekheb">Καυσουμενα λυθησονται</span>, <span class="ital">burning shall be dissolved. </span>The word <span class="greekheb">στοιχεια</span>, rendered <span class="ital">elements, </span>signifies the first principles, or constituent parts of any thing. Hence it denotes the principles of science, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>,) as well as the principles of bodies. Estius understands by the word the elements of which this terraqueous globe is composed; but as the melting of these is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2 Peter 3:12</a>, Macknight is of opinion “that, in this verse, the apostle is speaking of the electrical matter, the sulphureous vapours, the clouds, and whatever else floats in the air, all which, burning furiously, will be disunited and separated.” <span class="ital">The earth also, and the works that are therein </span>— Whether of nature or of art; <span class="ital">shall be burned up </span>— And has not God already abundantly provided for this? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1st, By the stores of subterranean fire, which are so frequently bursting out at Ætna, Vesuvius, Hecla, and many other burning mountains; 2d, by the <span class="ital">ethereal </span>(vulgarly called <span class="ital">electrical</span>) fire, diffused through the whole globe; which, if the secret chain that now binds it up were loosed, would immediately dissolve the whole frame of nature; 3d, By comets, one of which, if it touch the earth in its course toward the sun, must needs strike it into that abyss of fire.

The heavens and the earth which now are, by the same word, it is declared, will be destroyed by fire. This is as sure to come, as the truth and the power of God can make it. Christians are here taught and established in the truth of the coming of the Lord. Though, in the account of men, there is a vast difference between one day and a thousand years, yet, in the account of God, there is no difference. All things past, present, and future, are ever before him: the delay of a thousand years cannot be so much to him, as putting off any thing for a day or for an hour is to us. If men have no knowledge or belief of the eternal God, they will be very apt to think him such as themselves. How hard is it to form any thoughts of eternity! What men count slackness, is long-suffering, and that to us-ward; it is giving more time to hisown people, to advance in knowledge and holiness, and in the exercise of faith and patience, to abound in good works, doing and suffering what they are called to, that they may bring glory to God. Settle therefore in your hearts that you shall certainly be called to give an account of all things done in the body, whether good or evil. And let a humble and diligent walking before God, and a frequent judging of yourselves, show a firm belief of the future judgment, though many live as if they were never to give any account at all. This day will come, when men are secure, and have no expectation of the day of the Lord. The stately palaces, and all the desirable things wherein wordly-minded men seek and place their happiness, shall be burned up; all sorts of creatures God has made, and all the works of men, must pass through the fire, which shall be a consuming fire to all that sin has brought into the world, though a refining fire to the works of God's hand. What will become of us, if we set our affections on this earth, and make it our portion, seeing all these things shall be burned up? Therefore make sure of happiness beyond this visible world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the day of the Lord - The day of the Lord Jesus. That is, the day in which he will be manifested. It is called his day, because he will then be the grand and prominent object as the Judge of all.

It cannot mean that the holy home where God dwells will pass away; nor do we need to suppose that this declaration extends to the starry worlds and systems as disclosed by modern astronomy. The word is doubtless used in a popular sense - that is, as things appear to us; and the fair interpretation of the passage would demand only such a change as would occur by the destruction of this world by fire. If a conflagration should take place, embracing the earth and its surrounding atmosphere, all the phenomena would occur which are here described; and, if this would be so, then this is all that can be proved to be meant by the passage. Such a destruction of the elements could not occur without "a great noise."<p>And the elements shall melt with fervent heat - Greek: "the elements being burned, or burning, (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  kausoumena,) shall be dissolved." The idea is, that the cause of their being "dissolved" shall be fire; or that there will be a conflagration extending to what are here called the "elements," that shall produce the effects here described by the word "dissolved." There has been much difference of opinion in regard to the meaning of the word here rendered "elements," (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;  stoicheia.) The word occurs in the New Testament only in the following places: <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a>, in which it is rendered "elements;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>, in which it is rendered "rudiments;" and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, where it is rendered "principles." For the general meaning of the word, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. The word denotes the "rudiments" of anything; the minute parts or portions of which anything is composed, or which constitutes the simple portions out of which anything grows, or of which it is compounded.<p>Here it would properly denote the component parts of the material world; or those which enter into its composition, and of which it is made up. It is not to be supposed that the apostle used the term with the same exact signification with which a chemist would use it now, but in accordance with the popular use of the term in his day. In all ages, and in all languages, some such word, with more or less scientific accuracy, has been employed to denote the primary materials out of which others were formed, just as, in most languages, there have been characters or letters to denote the elementary sounds of which language is composed. In general, the ancients supposed that the elements out of which all things were formed were four in number - air, earth, fire, and water. Modern science has overturned this theory completely, and has shown that these, so far from being simple elements, are themselves compounds; but the tendency of modern science is still to show that the elements of all things are in fact few in number.<p>The word, as used here by Peter, would refer to the elements of things as then understood in a popular sense; it would now not be an improper word to be applied to the few elements of which all things are composed, as disclosed by modern chemistry. In either case, the use of the word would be correct. Whether applied to the one or the other, science has shown that all are capable of combustion. Water, in its component parts, is inflammable in a high degree; and even the diamond has been shown to be combustible. The idea contained in the word "dissolved," is, properly, only the change which heat produces. Heat changes the forms of things; dissolves them into their elements; dissipates those which were solid by driving them off into gases, and produces new compounds, but it annihilates nothing. It could not be demonstrated from this phrase that the world would be annihilated by fire; it could be proved only that it will undergo important changes. So far as the action of fire is concerned, the form of the earth may pass away, and its aspect be changed; but unless the direct power which created it interposes to annihilate it, the matter which now composes it will still be in existence.<p>The earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned up - That is, whether they are the works of God or man - the whole vegetable and animal creation, and all the towers, the towns, the palaces, the productions of genius, the paintings, the statuary, the books, which man has made:<p>"The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,<p>The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<p>And all that it inherits, shall dissolve,<p>And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,<p>Leave not one wreck behind."<p>The word rendered "burned up," like the word just before used and rendered "fervent heat" - a word of the same origin, but here intensive - means that they will undergo such a change as fire will produce; not, necessarily, that the matter composing them will be annihilated. If the matter composing the earth is ever to be destroyed entirely, it must be by the immediate power of God, because only He who created can destroy. There is not the least evidence that a particle of matter originally made has been annihilated since the world began; and there are no fires so intense, no chemical powers so mighty, as to cause a particle of matter to cease wholly to exist. So far as the power of man is concerned, and so far as one portion of matter can prey on another, matter is as imperishable as mind, and neither can be destroyed unless God destroys it. Whether it is His purpose to annihilate any portion of the matter which He has made, does not appear from His Word; but it is clear that He intends that the universe shall undergo important changes. As to the possibility or probability of such a destruction by fire as is predicted here, no one can have any doubt who is acquainted with the disclosures of modern science in regard to the internal structure of the earth.<p>Even the ancient philosophers, from some cause, supposed that the earth would still be destroyed by fire (see my notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>), and modern science has made it probable that the interior of the earth is a melted and intensely-heated mass of burning materials; that the habitable world is only a comparatively thin crust (shell) over those internal fires; that earthquakes are caused by the vapors engendered by that heated mass when water comes in contact with it; and that volcanoes are only openings and vent-holes through which those internal flames make their way to the surface. Whether these fires will everywhere make their way to the surface, and produce an universal conflagration, perhaps could not be determined by science, but no one can doubt that the simple command of God would be all that is necessary to pour those burning floods over the earth, just as He once caused the waters to roll over every mountain and through every valley.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

That is, the Lord will come in that day, which he has fixed, according to his promise, than which nothing is more certain; and he will come as a thief in the night: he will come "in the night", which may be literally understood; for as his first coming was in the night; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8</a>; so perhaps his second coming may be in the night season; or figuratively, when it will be a time of great darkness; when there will be little faith in the earth, and both the wise and foolish virgins will be slumbering and sleeping; when it will be a season of great security, as it was in the days of Noah, and at the time of the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, leave out the phrase, "in the night": and the Alexandrian copy uses the emphatic article, "in the night": and he will come, "as a thief", in the dark, indiscernibly; it will not be known what hour he will come; he will come suddenly, at an unawares, when he is not expected, to the great surprise of men, and especially of the scoffers; when the following awful things will be done: <p>in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise; not the third heaven, the seat of angels and glorified saints, and even of God himself; but the starry and airy heavens, which shall pass away, not as to their matter and substance, but as to some of their accidents and qualities, and the present use of them; and that with a great noise, like that of a violent storm, or tempest; though the Ethiopic version renders it, "without a noise"; and which is more agreeable to his coming as a thief, which is not with noise, but in as still a manner as possible; and some learned men observe, that the word signifies swiftly, as well as with a noise; and, accordingly, the Syriac version renders it "suddenly"; and the Arabic version "presently", immediately; that is, as soon as Christ shall come, immediately, at once, from his face shall the earth and heavens flee away, as John in a vision saw, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>; <p>and the elements shall melt with fervent heat: not what are commonly called the four elements, earth, air, tire, and water, the first principles of all things: the ancient philosophers distinguished between principles and elements; principles, they say (h), are neither generated, nor corrupted;       "but the elements will be corrupted, or destroyed by the conflagration"; which exactly agrees with what the apostle here says: by the elements seem to be meant the host of heaven, being distinguished from the heavens, as the works of the earth are distinguished from the earth in the next clause; and design the firmament, or expanse, with the sun, moon, and stars in it, which will be purged and purified by this liquefaction by fire; <p>the earth also will be purged and purified from everything that is noxious, hurtful, unnecessary, and disagreeable; though the matter and substance of it will continue: <p>and the works that are therein shall be burnt up; all the works of nature, wicked men, cattle, trees, &amp;c. and all the works of men, cities, towns, houses, furniture, utensils, instruments of arts of all sorts, will be burnt by a material fire, breaking out of the earth and descending from heaven, for which the present heavens and earth are reserved: this general conflagration was not only known to the Jews, but to the Heathens, to the poets, and Platonist and Stoic philosophers, who frequently (i) speak of it in plain terms. Some are of opinion that these words refer to the destruction of Jerusalem; and so the passing away of the heavens may design the removal of their church state and ordinances, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26</a>, and the melting of the elements the ceasing of the ceremonial law, called the elements of the world, <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>, and the burning of the earth the destruction of the land of Judea, expressed in such a manner in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>, and particularly of the temple, and the curious works in that, which were all burnt up and destroyed by fire, though Titus endeavoured to prevent it, but could not (k): which sense may be included, inasmuch as there was a promise of Christ's coming to destroy the Jewish nation, and was expected; and which destruction was a prelude of the destruction of the world, and is sometimes expressed in such like language as that is; but then this must not take place, to the exclusion of the other sense: and whereas this sense makes the words to he taken partly in a figurative, and partly in a literal way; and seeing the heavens and the earth are in the context only literally taken, the former sense is to be preferred; and to which best agrees the following use to be made of these things. <p>(h) Diog.

This view is justified by the circumstance that in the preceding <span class="greekheb">οἱ οὐρανοὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">παρελεύσονται</span> no mention has as yet been made of the destruction of heaven and earth by fire. At variance with this view, Hofmann understands the expression <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα</span> here as a designation of the stars, arbitrarily asserting that <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα</span> “cannot be only original component parts, but must also be prominent points which dominate that by which they are surrounded,”—appealing to Justin (<span class="ital">Apolog.</span> ii. c. 5, and <span class="ital">Dial. c. Tr.</span> c. 23), who speaks of the stars as <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα οὐράνια</span>. To this view it may be objected, that the author could not picture to himself a burning of the stars, which appeared to him as fiery bodies; neither do any of the corresponding passages of Scripture allude to this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verb <span class="greekheb">καυσοῦσθαι</span> only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2 Peter 3:12</a> : “<span class="ital">to burn</span>;” in the classics: “to suffer from heat;” the participle expresses the reason of the <span class="greekheb">λυθήσονται</span>: “will be dissolved by the burning.” <span class="greekheb">λύειν</span>, in the sense of: to destroy, to bring to nothing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm" title="He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning.

T.: <span class="greekheb">ἡ γῆ καὶ τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῆς</span>, that is to say, the creations of God which belong to the earth, as they are related in the history of creation, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-6.htm" title="And swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:">Revelation 10:6</a>. Hofmann wrongly urges against this view, that on it <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ</span> would be sufficient; for even though this be true, it does not follow that the addition of the word <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span> would prove that it is “the works of men” that are here meant. With reference to the reading <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθήσεται</span>, instead of the <span class="ital">Rec.</span> <span class="greekheb">κατακαήσεται</span> (see critical remarks), Hofmann regards it as original, and considers the words <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ</span> … <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθήσεται</span> as an interrogative clause subjoined to the preceding affirmative clause. Of course an interrogative clause may be subjoined to an affirmative; but when Hofmann, in support of his interpretation, appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>, he fails to observe that the relation between the statement and the question there is entirely different from that which is supposed to exist here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_peter/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2 Peter 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμέρα Κυρίου</span>.

Comp. a like picture of the end of the world’s history in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.">Revelation 21:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the elements shall melt with fervent heat</span>] The word “elements” may possibly stand for what were so called in some of the physical theories of the time, the fire, air, earth, water, out of which all existing phenomena were believed to be evolved (comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/19-18.htm" title="For the elements were changed in themselves by a kind of harmony, like as in a psaltery notes change the name of the tune, and yet are always sounds; which may well be perceived by the sight of the things that have been done.">Wis 19:18</a>). The word was, however, used a little later on for what we call the “heavenly bodies,” sun, moon, and stars (Justin Mart. <span class="ital">Apol</span>. ii. 4. 4), and that meaning, seeing that the “elements” are distinguished from the “earth,” and that one of the four elements is to be the instrument of destruction, is probably the meaning here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the earth also and the works that are therein</span>] The use of the word “works” suggests the thought that the Apostle had chiefly in view all that man had wrought out on the surface of the globe; his cities, palaces, monuments, or the like. The comprehensive term may, however, include “works” as the “deeds” of men, of which St Paul says that they shall all be tried by fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2 Peter 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἥξει</span>) <span class="ital">will be present</span>.—<span class="greekheb">οἱ οὐρανοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">the heavens</span>) which the mockers say shall continue as they are, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2 Peter 3:4</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ῥοιζηδὸν</span>, <span class="ital">with a great noise</span>) The word <span class="greekheb">ῥοῖζος</span> has letters resembling the sound of an arrow in its flight, the trickling of water, etc.—<span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖά</span>, <span class="ital">the elements</span>) that is, <span class="ital">the works which are in the heavens</span>, as the following words show. The sun, the moon, and the stars, are often called <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα</span>, by Theophilus of Antioch, p. 22, 148, 228, and by others, whom Wolf has brought together in his edition, and whom Suicer has noticed, and Menage on Diogenes Laertius, vi. 102, they are called <span class="ital">elementa</span> by Jerome. As at the creation, so at the destruction of the world, the sun, the moon, and the stars, are accustomed especially to be mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>; and they are certainly contained in some part of Peter’s representation, and especially in the word <span class="ital">elements</span>, rather than <span class="ital">fire, air, water</span>, and <span class="ital">earth</span>. For Peter makes mention of <span class="ital">the earth</span> separately, and under this he includes <span class="ital">water</span>, or even <span class="ital">air</span> (of which, however, the Scripture rarely makes mention, when speaking of the nature of things); <span class="ital">fire</span> will be that, by which the elements shall melt away. The same word is used, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-17.htm" title="For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of the elements:">Wis 7:17</a>.

"The day of the Lord" meets us often in the prophets; it is usually associated with the thought of judgment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>). In the New Testament it signifies the second advent of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a thief in the night.</span> The best manuscripts omit here "in the night." St. Peter is evidently echoing the Lord's words in that great prophetic discourse on the Mount of Olives, which must have made such a deep impression upon the apostles. This illustration of the sudden coming of the thief is repeated not only by St. Peter here, but also by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>), and twice by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a> and Revelation 16:15). <span class="cmt_word">In the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise.</span> The Greek for "with a great noise (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and is one of those remarkable poetic forms which are not unfrequent in this Epistle: the noun <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used of the whizzing of arrows, of the rush of wings, of the sound of mighty winds or roaring waters. It may be understood here of the crash of a falling world or of the roar of the destroying flames. The word rendered "pass away" is that used by our Lord in the prophecy just referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>; also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.</span> It is uncertain whether by "the elements" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) St. Peter means the four elements (in the old and popular use of the word), or the great constituent parts of the universe, the heavenly bodies. Against the first view is the assertion that one of those elements is to be the agent of destruction. But the word rendered "melt" means "shall be dissolved" or "loosed;" and it may be, as Bishop Wordsworth says, that "St. Peter's meaning seems to be that the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, elements or rudiments, of which the universe is composed and compacted, will be loosed; that is, the framework of the world will be disorganized; and this is the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> in the LXX. (Wisd. 7:17 Wisd. 19:17) and in Hippolytus, 'Philos.,' pages 219, 318. The dissolution is contrasted with the consistency described by the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in verse 5. The heavens are reserved for fire, and will pass away with a rushing noise, and, being set on fire, will be dissolved; the elements will be on fire and melt, and he reduced to a state of confusion; the earth and the works therein will be burnt up. There does not seem, therefore, to be any cause for abandoning the common meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, the elemental principles of which the universe is made." On the other hand, the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> is certainly used of the heavenly bodies by Justin Martyr ('Apolog.,' 2. c. 5, and 'Dial. cum Tryphon,' c. 23); and the heavenly bodies are constantly mentioned in the descriptions of the awful convulsions of the great day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-24.htm">Mark 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, etc.). The objection that the word does not bear this meaning elsewhere in Holy Scripture is of little weight, as this is the only place in which it has a physical sense. The literal translation of the clause is, "The elements, being scorched, shall be dissolved." The word for "being scorched" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs in the New Testament only here and in verse 12; it is used by the Greek physicians of the burning heat of fever. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "shall be dissolved or loosened." <span class="cmt_word">The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</span> By "the works that are therein" St. Peter seems to mean all the works both of God and of man, "opera naturae et artis" (Bengel). There is a very remarkable reading here (supported by the Sinaitic and Vatican and another uncial manuscript), <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall be discovered," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall be burned up." If we understand "the works that are therein" of man's works and actions, this reading will give a good sense (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, "Every man's work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is"). Or the clause may be regarded as interrogative, "Shall the earth and the works that are therein be found?" But the reading, "shall be burned up" is well supported, and suits the context best. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The day of the Lord<p>Compare the same phrase in Peter's sermon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>.

It is a word in which the sound suggests the sense (rhoizedon); and the kindred noun, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, is used in classical Greek of the whistling of an arrow; the sound of a shepherd's pipe; the rush of wings; the plash of water; the hissing of a serpent; and the sound of filing.<p>The elements (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;)<p>Derived from &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a row, and meaning originally one of a row or series; hence a component or element. The name for the letters of the alphabet, as being set in rows. Applied to the four elements - fire, air, earth, water; and in later times to the planets and signs of the zodiac. It is used in all ethical sense in other passages; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>, "elements or rudiments of the world." Also of elementary teaching, such as the law, which was fitted for an earlier stage in the world's history; and of the first principles of religious knowledge among men. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, of formal ordinances. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>. The kindred verb &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to walk, carries the idea of keeping in line, according to the radical sense. Thus, walk according to rule (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>); walkest orderly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>).

Here the word is of course used in a physical sense, meaning the parts of which this system of things is composed. Some take it as meaning the heavenly bodies, but the term is too late and technical in that sense. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>, the powers of the heaven.<p>Shall melt (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>More literally, as Rev., shall be dissolved.<p>With fervent heat (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)<p>Lit., being scorched up. </body></html>
