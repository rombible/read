Here the apostle has laid open the true source of infidelity, and of men’s scoffing at religion. “They may pretend to religion,” as Dr. Benson says, “but they are governed by sense and appetite, and they take refuge in infidelity, and scoff at religion, to make themselves easy in their vices.” “When the apostle wrote this passage, there were Epicureans and others among the Gentiles, and Sadducees among the Jews, who ridiculed the promises of the gospel concerning the resurrection of the dead, the general judgment, the destruction of the earth, and a future state of rewards and punishments. Wherefore, seeing the scoffers, of whom St. Peter here speaks, had not yet appeared, but were to come in the last period of the duration of the world, it is probable that they were to arise in the church itself. Accordingly they are reproved, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2 Peter 3:5</a>,) for being wilfully ignorant of the Mosaic history of the creation and of the deluge; and Jude says, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-18.htm" title="Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof....">Judges 1:18-19</a>,) the scoffers separated themselves from other Christians, and had not the Spirit, though they pretended to be inspired. The evil of scoffing at the doctrines and promises of the gospel may be learned from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm" title="Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.">Psalm 1:1</a>, where scoffing at religion is represented as the highest stage of impiety.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 The purified minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may be active and lively in the work of holiness. There will be scoffers in the last days, under the gospel, men who make light of sin, and mock at salvation by Jesus Christ. One very principal article of our faith refers to what only has a promise to rest upon, and scoffers will attack it till our Lord is come. They will not believe that he will come. Because they see no changes, therefore they fear not God, Ps 55:19. What he never has done, they fancy he never can do, or never will do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing this first - As among the first and most important things to be attended to - as one of the predictions which demand your special regard. Jude Jde 1:18 says that the fact that there would be "mockers in the last time," had been particularly foretold by thom. It is probable that Peter refers to the same thing, and we may suppose that this was so well understood by all the apostles that they made it a common subject of preaching.<p>That there shall come in the last days - In the last dispensation; in the period during which the affairs of the world shall be wound up. The apostle does not say that that was the last time in the sense that the world was about to come to an end; nor is it implied that the period called "the last day" might not be a very long period, longer in fact than either of the previous periods of the world. He says that during that period it had been predicted there would arise those whom he here calls "scoffers." On the meaning of the phrase "in the last days," as used in the Scriptures, see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> note.<p>Scoffers - In Jude Jde 1:18 the same Greek word is rendered "mockers." The word means those who deride, reproach, ridicule. There is usually in the word the idea of contempt or malignity toward an object. Here the sense seems to be that they would treat with derision or contempt the predictions respecting the advent of the Saviour, and the end of the world. It would appear probable that there was a particular or definite class of men referred to; a class who would hold special opinions, and who would urge plausible objections against the fulfillment of the predictions respecting the end of the world, and the second coming of the Saviour - for those are the points to which Peter particularly refers. It scarcely required inspiration to foresee that there would be "scoffers" in the general sense of the term - for they have so abounded in every age, that no one would hazard much in saying that they would be found at any particular time; but the eye of the apostle is evidently on a particular class of people, the special form of whose reproaches would be the ridicule of the doctrines that the Lord Jesus would return; that there would be a day of judgment; that the world would be consumed by fire, etc. Tillotson explains this of the Carpocratians, a large sect of the Gnostics, who denied the resurrection of the dead, and the future judgment.<p>Walking after their own lusts - Living in the free indulgence of their sensual appetites.

In the first place, principally, and chiefly, and which might easily be known and observed from the writings of the apostles and prophets; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; <p>that there shall come in the last days scoffers, or "mockers"; such as would make a mock at sin, make light of it, plead for it, openly commit it, and glory in it; and scoff at all religion, as the prejudice of education, as an engine of state, a piece of civil policy to keep subjects in awe, as cant, enthusiasm, and madness, as a gloomy melancholy thing, depriving men of true pleasure; and throw out their flouts and jeers at those that are the most religious, for the just, upright man, is commonly by such laughed to scorn, and those that depart from evil make themselves a prey; and particularly at the ministers of the word, for a man that has scarcely so much common sense as to preserve him from the character of an idiot, thinks himself a wit of the age, if he can at any rate break a jest upon a Gospel minister: nor do the Scriptures of truth escape the banter and burlesque of these scoffers; the doctrines of it being foolishness to them, and the commands and ordinances in it being grievous and intolerable to them; yea, to such lengths do those proceed, as to scoff at God himself; at his persons, purposes, providences, and promises; at Jehovah the Father, as the God of nature and providence, and especially as the God and Father of Christ, and of all grace in him; at Jehovah the Son, at his person, as being the Son of God, and truly God, at his office, as Mediator, and at his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, which they trample under foot; and at Jehovah the Spirit, whom they do despite unto, as the spirit of grace, deriding his operations in regeneration and sanctification, as dream and delusion; and, most of all, things to come are the object of their scorn and derision; as the second coming of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, a future judgment, the torments of hell, and the joys of heaven; all which they represent as the trifles and juggles of designing men: such as these, according to the prophets and apostles, were to come in "the last days"; either in the days of the Messiah, in the Gospel dispensation, the times between the first and second coming of Christ; for it is a rule with the Jews (s), that wherever the last days are mentioned, the days of the Messiah are intended; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>; when the prophets foretold such scoffers should come; or in the last days of the Jewish state, both civil and religious, called "the ends of the world", <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; a little before the destruction of Jerusalem, when iniquity greatly abounded, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-11.htm">Matthew 24:11</a>; or "in the last of the days"; as the words may be rendered; and so answer to , in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, and may regard the latter part of the last times; the times of the apostles were the last days, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; they began then, and will continue to Christ's second coming; when some time before that, it will be a remarkable age for scoffers and scorners; and we have lived to see an innumerable company of them, and these predictions fulfilled; from whence it may be concluded, that the coming of Christ is at hand: these scoffers are further described as <p>walking after their own lusts; either after the carnal reasonings of their minds, admitting of nothing but what they can comprehend by reason, making that the rule, test, and standard of all their principles, and so cast away the law of the Lord, and despise the word of the Holy One of Israel; or rather, after their sinful and fleshly lusts, making them their guides and governors, and giving up themselves entirely to them, to obey and fulfil them; the phrase denotes a continued series of sinning, a progress in it, a desire after it, and pleasure in it, and an obstinate persisting in it; scoffers at religion and revelation are generally libertines; and such as sit in the seat of the scornful, are in the counsel of the ungodly, and way of sinners, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. <p>(s) Kimchi in Isa. ii. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_peter/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</span><p>(2) He vouches the second coming of Christ against the Epicureans by name.<p>(a) Monstrous men, who will seem wise by their contempt of God, and wicked boldness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_peter/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm" title="Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,">2 Peter 3:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο πρῶτον γινώσκοντες</span>] cf. chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-20.htm" title="Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.">2 Peter 1:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γινώσκοντες</span>] refers in loose construction (instead of an accus.) to the subject contained in <span class="greekheb">μνησθῆναι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐλεύσονται κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-18.htm" title="Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.">Judges 1:18</a>.[86]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἘΜΠΑΙΓΜΟΝῇ</span></span></span>] gives sharp prominence to the conduct of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΜΠΑῖΚΤΑΙ</span></span></span>.

St. Peter has the words, "knowing this first," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a>, where he is speaking of the interpretation of prophecy; he repeats them now when referring to the scoffers who mocked at the long delay of the Lord's coming foretold by the prophets. (For "the last days," see note on 1 Peter 1:20.) The Revised Version has, "Mockers shall come with mockery." This represents the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>, found in nearly all the best manuscripts, which give emphasis to the expression after the Hebrew manner. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, scoffers, only in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-18.htm">Jude 1:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Walking after their own lusts.</span> Self-indulgence often leads to skepticism. This verse is quoted in a homily ascribed to Hippolytus. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Scoffers walking (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>This is the reading followed by A. V. But the later texts have added &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;, in mockery, occurring only here, though a kindred word for mockings (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;) is found <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36</a>. This addition gives a play upon the words; and so Rev., "Mockers shall come with mockery, walking," etc. </body></html>
