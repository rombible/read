In the other two so-called Pastoral Epistles addressed to Timothy, St. Paul simply styles himself “an Apostle of Jesus Christ.” Possibly, the longer and more formal title is here adopted because his relations were hardly ever of so intimate a character with Titus as with Timothy; the latter would seem to have held the position of St. Paul’s <span class= "ital">adopted son.</span> (See Note below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm" title="To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.">Titus 1:4</a>, “To Titus.”)<p><span class= "bld">According to the faith of God’s elect.</span>—The English version here entirely fails to give the meaning of the Greek preposition. The rendering should be, “for (the furtherance of) the faith,” or, in other words, “the object of my (Paul’s) apostleship was, that through my instrumentality the chosen of God should believe.” The whole question respecting these “elect,” or “chosen of God,” is surrounded with deep mystery; three or four guiding thoughts may, however, be safely laid down. (1) In the visible world such an <span class= "ital">apparently</span> arbitrary election to special privileges, fortune, happiness. utterly irrespective, in the first instance, of individual merit, does exist. This is clear to all of us. (2) In grace we are distinctly told repeatedly that a similar election exists, and our own observation certainly coincides here with revelation. (3) Such election in no case seemingly affects our position here as free agents; surrounded with the most precious privileges, gifted with much knowledge, it is possible, as we, alas, too often see, deliberately to refuse the good and to choose the evil. (4) All such allusions to the “elect” as, for instance, the one here before us, are intended, not as a stumbling-block for the believer, but as a comfort for the faithful, struggling man of God, for it tells him how the Eternal “before the ages” had chosen him to be His servant.<p><span class= "bld">And the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness.</span>—More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">and the full knowledge of the truth which is designed for godliness, </span>or, <span class= "ital">which leadeth to godliness.</span> Here the further purpose of St. Paul’s apostleship is specified. St. Paul was appointed an Apostle that through him the elect of God might believe and heed “the truth”—that truth, the knowledge of which produces as its fruit in the individual a holy, useful life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/titus/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Paul, a servant of </span>the one living and true <span class="ital">God </span>— In some of his other epistles, Paul calls himself <span class="ital">a servant of Jesus Christ; </span>but this is the only one in which he calls himself <span class="ital">a servant of God: </span>an appellation which some think he took because the Judaizing teachers in Crete affirmed that he had apostatized from God, by receiving into his church the uncircumcised Gentiles, and thereby freeing them from obedience to the law of Moses, as a term of salvation. <span class="ital">And an apostle of Jesus Christ </span>— By this title he distinguishes himself from other pious and holy men, who were all servants of God; and asserts his apostleship, not to raise himself in the estimation of Titus, but to make the false teachers in Crete, and all in every age who should read this letter, sensible that every thing he ordered Titus to inculcate was of divine authority. <span class="ital">According to the faith of God’s elect </span>— That is, God’s true people; the propagation of which faith was the proper business of an apostle. <span class="ital">And the acknowledging of the truth </span>— That is, the doctrine of the gospel here termed the truth, to distinguish it from the errors of heathenism, and the shadows of the Mosaic law; and because it teaches the true, and the only true way of salvation for Jews and Gentiles; <span class="ital">which is after godliness — </span>Which in every point agrees with and supports the true, vital, spiritual worship and service of God; and indeed has no other end or scope.

All gospel truth is according to godliness, teaching the fear of God. The intent of the gospel is to raise up hope as well as faith; to take off the mind and heart from the world, and to raise them to heaven and the things above. How excellent then is the gospel, which was the matter of Divine promise so early, and what thanks are due for our privileges! Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and whoso is appointed and called, must preach the word. Grace is the free favour of God, and acceptance with him. Mercy, the fruits of the favour, in the pardon of sin, and freedom from all miseries both here and hereafter. And peace is the effect and fruit of mercy. Peace with God through Christ who is our Peace, and with the creatures and ourselves. Grace is the fountain of all blessings.

R. Faussett   <p>INTRODUCTION<p>Genuineness.&#8212;Clement of Rome quotes it [Epistle to the Corinthians, 2]; Iren&aelig;us [Against Heresies, 3.3.4] refers to it as Paul's; Theophilus of Antioch [To Autolychus, 3.14], quotes it as Scripture. Compare Clement of Alexandria [Miscellanies, 1, p. 299]; Tertullian [The Prescription against Heretics, 6].<p>Time and Place of Writing.&#8212;This Epistle seems to have been written from Corinth [Birks], subsequently to his first imprisonment, when Paul was on his way to Nicopolis (Tit 3:12) in Epirus, where he purposed passing the winter, shortly before his martyrdom, A.D. 67. Birks thinks, from the similarity of the Epistle to Titus and First Timothy, that both were written from the same place, Corinth, and at dates not widely apart; First Timothy shortly after coming to Corinth, before he had planned a journey to Epirus, the Epistle to Titus afterwards. The journey to Crete and Ephesus for the bearers of his letters would be easy from Corinth, and he could himself thence easily pass into Epirus. He had shortly before visited Crete, wherein a Church existed (though without due organization), the first foundation of which he may have partly laid at his former visit (Ac 27:7, &c.), when on his way to his first imprisonment at Rome. That he returned to the East after his first imprisonment appears most probable from Php 2:24; Phm 22. However, there may have been seeds of Christianity sown in Crete, even before his first visit, by the Cretans who heard Peter's preaching on Pentecost (Ac 2:11).<p>Occasion of Writing.&#8212;Corrupt elements soon showed themselves in the Cretan Church, similar to those noticed in the Epistles to Timothy, as existing in the Ephesian Church, Judaism, false pretensions to science, and practical ungodliness. Paul, on his late visit, had left Titus in Crete to establish Church government, and ordain presbyters (deacons are not mentioned). Titus had been several times employed by Paul on a mission to the Corinthian Churches, and had probably thence visited Crete, which was within easy reach of Corinth. Hence the suitableness of his selection by the apostle for the superintendence of the Cretan Church. Paul now follows up with instructions by letter those he had already given to Titus in person on the qualifications of elders, and the graces becoming the old, the young, and females, and warns him against the unprofitable speculations so rife in Crete. The national character of the Cretans was low in the extreme, as Epimenides, quoted in Tit 1:12, paints it. Livy [History, 44.45], stigmatizes their avarice; Polybius [Histories, 6.46.9], their ferocity and fraud; and [Histories, 6.47.5], their mendacity, so much so, that "to Cretanize" is another name for to lie: they were included in the proverbial three infamous initials "K" or "C," "Cappadocia, Crete, Cilicia."<p>Notices of Titus.&#8212;It is strange that he is never mentioned by this name in Acts, and there seems none of those mentioned in that book who exactly answers to him. He was a Greek, and therefore a Gentile (Ga 2:1, 3), and converted by Paul (Tit 1:4). He accompanied the apostle on the deputation sent from the Church of Antioch to Jerusalem, to consult the apostles respecting the circumcision of Gentile converts (Ac 15:2); and, agreeably to the decree of the council there, was not circumcised. He was in company with Paul at Ephesus, whence he was sent to Corinth to commence the collection for the Jerusalem saints, and to ascertain the effect of the First Epistle on the Corinthians (2Co 7:6-9; 8:6; 12:18), and there showed an unmercenary spirit. He next proceeded to Macedon, where he joined Paul, who had been already eagerly expecting him at Troas (2Co 2:12, 13, "Titus my brother," 2Co 7:6). He was then employed by the apostle in preparing the collection for the poor saints in Judea, and became the bearer of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians (2Co 8:16, 17, 23). Paul in it calls him "my partner and fellow helper concerning you." His being located in Crete (Tit 1:5) was subsequent to Paul's first imprisonment, and shortly before the second, about A.D. 67, ten years subsequent to the last notice of him in Second Corinthians (2Co 12:18), A.D. 57. He probably met Paul, as the apostle desired, at Nicopolis; for his subsequent journey into Dalmatia, thence (or else from Rome, whither he may have accompanied Paul) would be more likely, than from the distant Crete (2Ti 4:10, written subsequently to the Epistle to Titus). In the unsettled state of things then, Titus' episcopal commission in Crete was to be but temporary, Paul requiring the presence of Titus with himself, whenever Artemas or Tychicus should arrive in Crete and set him free from his duties there.<p>Tradition represents him to have died peaceably in Crete, as archbishop of Gortyna, at an advanced age.   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>Tit 1:1-16.

In Ro 1:1 it is "servant of Jesus Christ" (Ga 1:10; Php 1:1; compare Ac 16:17; Re 1:1; 15:3). In Ro 1:1, there follows, "called to be an apostle," which corresponds to the general designation of the office first, "servant of God," here, followed by the special description, "apostle of Jesus Christ." The full expression of his apostolic office answers, in both Epistles, to the design, and is a comprehensive index to the contents. The peculiar form here would never have proceeded from a forger.<p>according to the faith&#8212;rather, "for," "with a view to subserve the faith"; this is the object of my apostleship (compare Tit 1:4, 9; Ro 1:5).<p>the elect&#8212;for whose sake we ought to endure all things (2Ti 2:10). This election has its ground, not in anything belonging to those thus distinguished, but in the purpose and will of God from everlasting (2Ti 1:9; Ro 8:30-33; compare Lu 18:7; Eph 1:4; Col 3:12). Ac 13:48 shows that all faith on the part of the elect, rests on the divine foreordination: they do not become elect by their faith, but receive faith, and so become believers, because they are elect.<p>and the acknowledging of the truth&#8212;"and (for promoting) the full knowledge of the truth," that is, the Christian truth (Eph 1:13).<p>after godliness&#8212;that is, which belongs to piety: opposed to the knowledge which has not for its object the truth, but error, doctrinal and practical (Tit 1:11, 16; 1Ti 6:3); or even which has for its object mere earthly truth, not growth in the divine life. "Godliness," or "piety," is a term peculiar to the Pastoral Epistles: a fact explained by the apostle having in them to combat doctrine tending to "ungodliness" (2Ti 2:16; compare Tit 2:11, 12).<span class="bld">Tit 1:1-4</span> The salutation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tit 1:5</span> For what end Titus was left in Crete.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tit 1:6-9</span> How they should be qualified who are ordained<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>to the ministry.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tit 1:10,11</span> The mouths of evil teachers must be stopped.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tit 1:12-16</span> The bad character of the Cretians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Paul, a servant of God; </span> that is, in the work of the ministry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And an apostle of Jesus Christ; </span> who glory in this as my greatest honour and dignity, that I was one immediately sent by Jesus Christ to preach the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to the faith of God's elect; </span> kata pistin according to what the elect, or chosen of God from the beginning of the world, have believed; so as it is no new doctrine which I bring: or else kata here should be translated for, denoting the final cause, as some judge it signifieth, <span class="bld">2Ti 1:1</span>, and in <span class="bld">Tit 1:9</span> of this chapter; then the sense is, that he was sent to be an instrument to beget faith in such as God had chosen unto life. <span class="bld">Act 26:18</span>, for those only <span class="ital">ordained to eternal life</span> believe, <span class="bld">Act 13:48</span>, and Paul was sent to be a helper of their faith.

So James styles himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a> and others of the apostles, as Peter and Jude, call themselves the servants of Jesus Christ; and as does the Apostle Paul also; and both seem to be esteemed by them as high characters and titles of honour, by which they chose to be described and known. Paul, before his conversion, was a servant of sin, of divers lusts and pleasures, and which he owns in this epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3</a> but being called by grace, he became free from the vassalage of sin, and became a servant of God, and of righteousness; and henceforward, from a principle of grace, and being constrained by love, served the Lord, and yielded obedience to his commands and ordinances, with all readiness and cheerfulness: though this character belongs to him in a higher sense than it does to believers in common; and respects his ministerial service, or his serving God in the Gospel of his Son; in which he, and others, were eminently the servants of the most high God, whose business greatly lay in showing unto men the way of salvation. <p>And an apostle of Jesus Christ: constituted, qualified, and sent by him to preach his Gospel; and who had his mission, commission, and doctrine from him; and was an ambassador of his, who represented him, and preached him; and had a power of working miracles to confirm his mission and ministry; and so had all the signs and proofs of an apostle in him; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>. <p>And according to the faith of God's elect: which may either denote the agreement there was between the ministry of the apostle, and the faith of the choice and eminent saints of God, under the former dispensation; he saying no other things than what Moses, and the prophets did; and laying no other foundation of salvation than they did, and which is therefore called the foundation of the apostles and prophets; and directing souls to the righteousness, sacrifice, and blood of Christ, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, to which the faith of Old Testament saints looked, and by whose grace they were justified, pardoned, and saved, as we are: or else the way and manner in which he became an apostle; it was "by, in, or through the faith of God's elect", as the Syriac version renders it; he was chosen of God, and brought as such to believe in Christ, and then called to be an apostle: or rather this may regard the end of his apostleship, and be rendered, "unto the faith of God's elect"; that is, either he was appointed an apostle, to preach the doctrine of faith, which once he destroyed, and which is but one, and is common to all the elect, and what is commonly received, and embraced by the elect of God, in all ages; or to be a means and instrument of bringing the elect of God to that faith in Christ, which is peculiar to them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>. There are some persons who are styled the elect of God; these are not all men, some are vessels of wrath fitted to destruction, ungodly men, foreordained to condemnation and given up to believe a lie, that they might be damned; nor the Jews only, nor all of them, for though, as a nation, they were chosen, above all others, to many outward privileges, yet they were not chosen to special grace, and eternal glory; only a remnant, according to the election of grace: but these are some of both, Jews and Gentiles; some of every kindred, tongue, people, and nation; these were chosen in Christ from eternity, and are the peculiar objects of the affection and care of God, whom he calls, justifies, and glorifies: and there is a special "faith" that belongs to these; which is a spiritual looking to Christ, a going to him, a laying hold and leaning on him, and trusting in him for salvation; and this faith is peculiar to the elect of God; all men have it not, and those that have it, have it through the free gift of God; nor is it given to any but to the chosen ones. The reason why the Jews did not believe in Christ, was, because they were not of this number, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-26.htm">John 10:26</a>. And this faith is secured and, made sure to them by their election; they are chosen to it, and through it to salvation; they believe in consequence, and by virtue of it; and certainly obtain it in all ages, as well as righteousness, life, and salvation; and it is that by which they are known to be the elect of God: and the apostle mentions it in this form, and manner, to distinguish it from other faith; the faith of devils, and of reprobates, and the historical and temporal faith of hypocrites, and nominal professors. <p>And the acknowledging of the truth; by which is meant the Gospel, often called the truth, and the word of truth; in distinction from that which was shadowy, the ceremonies of the law; and in opposition to that which is false, it being from the God of truth, concerning Christ, who is the truth; and containing nothing but truth, and what is led into by the Spirit of truth. Now to preach, spread, and defend this, was the apostle constituted in his office as such; and which he did preach with all clearness and faithfulness, to bring souls to a spiritual and experimental knowledge of it, and so to an acknowledgment, a public owning and professing of it: <p>which is after godliness; the Gospel is a doctrine according to godliness; the truths of it have an influence, both on internal and external godliness; they direct to, and promote the worship and fear of God, and a religious, righteous, sober, and godly life and conversation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/titus/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Paul, <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> a <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> elect, <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</span><p>(1) He vouches his apostleship (not for Titus, but for the Cretian's sake) both by the testimony of his outward calling, and by his consent in which he agrees with all the elect from the beginning of the world.<p>(a) A minister, as Christ himself, in his office of minister and head of the Prophets, is called a servant; Isa 43:10.<p>(b) Of those whom God has chosen.<p>(2) The faith in which all the elect agree, is the true and sincere knowledge of God for this purpose, that worshipping God correctly, they may at length obtain everlasting life according to the promise of God, who is true, which promise was exhibited in Christ in due time according to his eternal purpose.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/titus/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>.

This, however, can be nothing else than that which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a> is expressed by <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> (<span class="greekheb">εἰς ὑπακοὴν πίστεως ἐν πᾶσι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔθνεσιν</span>).

This general relation is limited too precisely by the common exposition: “for <span class="ital">producing</span> faith,” etc. Hofmann thinks the apostle uses <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ ΠΙΣΤ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΚΛ</span></span></span>. to describe faith as that which is presupposed in his apostleship, as that without which he would not be an apostle; but, on the one hand, we should in that case have had <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΟΥ</span></span></span>; and, on the other hand, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ</span></span></span>, does not express a presupposition or condition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΛΕΚΤΟῚ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> is taken by de Wette in a proleptic sense, to mean those who, by the free counsel of God, are predestinated to faith; and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ ΠΊΣΤΙΝ ἘΚΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, according to him, declares the faith of these elect to be the aim of the apostolic office. Wiesinger, on the contrary, thinks the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΛΕΚΤΟῚ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> quite abstract, leaving it uncertain “whether the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΛῆΣΙς</span></span></span> has already taken place in their case or not;” but he agrees with de Wette in taking the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΛΕΚΤΟΊ</span></span></span> to be the object of the apostolic labours, so that the meaning is: in order to produce or further faith in the elect. But in the N. T. the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΛΕΚΤΟῚ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> is always used of those who have already become believers, never of those who have not yet received the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΛῆΣΙς</span></span></span>. Since it cannot be said that the purpose of the apostolic office is to produce faith in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΛΕΚΤΟΊ</span></span></span> (Plitt: “that the elect may believe”), who as such already possess faith, nor that it is to further their faith, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΊΣΤΙς ἘΚΛΕΚΤῶΝ</span></span></span> must be taken as <span class="ital">one</span> thought, the genitive serving to define more precisely the faith to which Paul’s apostolic office is dedicated. We have therefore here a contrast between the <span class="ital">true</span> faith and the false <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, of which the heretics boasted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἘΠΊΓΝΩΣΙΝ ἈΛΗΘΕΊΑς Τῆς ΚΑΤʼ ΕὐΣΈΒΕΙΑΝ</span></span></span>] In genuine faith the knowledge of the truth is a substantial element; and Paul here lays stress on this element to point the contrast with the heretics. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΊΓΝΩΣΙς</span></span></span> is the subjective aspect, as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑ</span></span></span> is the objective.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΚΑΤʼ ΕὐΣΈΒΕΙΑΝ</span></span></span> serves to define <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑ</span></span></span> more precisely, as Chrysostom says: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΣΤῚ ΓᾺΡ ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑ ΠΡΑΓΜΆΤΩΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΛʼ Οὐ ΚΑΤʼ ΕὐΣΈΒΕΙΑΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΟἿΟΝ ΤῸ ΕἸΔΈΝΑΙ ΤᾺ ΓΕΩΡΓΙΚᾺ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΤῸ ΕἸΔΈΝΑΙ ΤΈΧΝΑς</span>,<span class="greekheb"></span></span> <span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΗΘῶς ἘΣΤῚΝ ΕἸΔΈΝΑΙ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΛʼ ΑὝΤΗ ΚΑΤʼ ΕὐΣΈΒΕΙΑΝ Ἡ ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑ</span></span></span>. De Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Plitt interpret <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΚΑΤʼ ΕὐΣΈΒΕΙΑΝ</span></span></span>: “leading to holiness,” thus, indeed, naming a right element in truth, but one rather indicated than expressed by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΆ</span></span></span>; it is merely said that here a truth is under discussion which is in nature akin to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὐΣΈΒΕΙΑ</span></span></span>. Hofmann translates it “piously,” asserting that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤʼ ΕὐΣΈΒΕΙΑΝ</span></span></span> without the article stands for an adjective; but had Paul used the clause as an adjective, he would certainly have written: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΚΑΤʼ ΕὐΣΈΒΕΙΑΝ ἈΛΗΘΕΊΑς</span></span></span> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm" title="(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)">Romans 9:11</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΚΑΤʼ ἘΚΛΟΓῊΝ ΠΡΌΘΕΣΙς</span></span></span>).

Here in the Salutation itself we have ‘God’s slave,’ ‘God’s elect,’ ‘God who cannot lie,’ ‘God our Saviour.’ Paul is the minister of the One Personal Eternal God; it is ‘faith in <span class="ital">Him</span>,’ full knowledge of <span class="ital">Him</span> that is wanted where, as Lewin remarks was the case in Crete, ‘Judaism and then Gnosticism, its offspring, had corrupted the Word, and the Gospel had become so disfigured by strange phantasies that its features could scarcely be recognised.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and an apostle of Jesus Christ</span>] The ‘and’ is in Vulgate ‘autem’ not ‘et’ or ‘sed,’ the exact force being almost ‘and so as a consequence.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Jesus Christ’ is here the right order, as Tischendorf 8th ed. admits, though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;">1 Timothy 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,">2 Timothy 1:1</a> ‘Christ Jesus’ should be read. See notes there. It is natural enough that the new order of the words should sometimes be displaced by the older and more familiar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to the faith</span>] Vulg. ‘secundum’; and the R.V. keeps <span class="bld">according to</span> rightly enough in spite of all modern commentators who wish for the meaning ‘with a view to’ as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm" title="I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.">Php 3:14</a>, ‘I press on <span class="ital">toward</span> the goal,’ and think that ‘according to’ must imply that the faith and knowledge is the rule or <span class="ital">norma</span> of the Apostle’s office. But surely the word is not so narrow. Its common use, e.g. in ‘The Gospel <span class="ital">according to</span> St Matthew,’ gives a wider sense, ‘in the sphere of,’ ‘on the side of truth where St Matthew stands and sees and teaches.’ And this sense is of course directly derived from the proper meaning of the preposition ‘along,’ ‘throughout.’ So here, the faith and full knowledge of the Cretan Christians is the sphere within which he is to execute this commission from Jesus Christ as an apostle <span class="ital">to them</span>. His apostleship might have other spheres for other times and other Churches.

"The faith of God's elect," etc., seems to imply that there was in some who were not elect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19, 20</a>) a corruption of the faith, a departure from it - a faith that was no faith, and something calling itself <span class="accented">truth</span> which was not "according to godliness," and so to point to rising heresies. The authors of these heresies were chiefly Jews (ver. 10), of whom there was a considerable colony in Crete (Conybeare and Howson, vol. it. p. 475; and Lewin, vol. 2. p. 337).
