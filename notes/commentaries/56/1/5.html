Crete—over whose Christian population Titus had been placed by St. Paul—was a well-known large and populous island in the Mediterranean. It lies geographically further south than any of the European islands, and, roughly speaking, almost at an equal distance from each of the three Old World continents—Europe, Asia, Africa. We identify it with the Caphtor of the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm" title="And the Avims which dwelled in Hazerim, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelled in their stead.)">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-4.htm" title="Because of the day that comes to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remains: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.">Jeremiah 47:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm" title="Are you not as children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? said the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?">Amos 9:7</a>). In modern times it is known by us as Candia. Very early it was the scene of an advanced civilisation. In the <span class= "ital">Odyssey</span> it is mentioned as possessing ninety cities; in the <span class= "ital">Iliad</span> as many as one hundred. Metellus added it, B.C. 69, to the Roman dominion. In the days of Augustus it was united into one province with Cyrene. It abounded with Jews of wealth and influence; this we learn from the testimony of Philo and of Josephus. It probably received the gospel from some of those of “Crete” who we are expressly told were present when the Spirit was poured on the Apostles on the first Pentecost after the Resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-11.htm" title="Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.">Acts 2:11</a>). The apparently flourishing state of Christianity on the island at this time was in great measure, no doubt, owing to the residence and labours among them of the Apostle St. Paul, whose work appears to have been mainly directed to preaching the gospel and to increasing the number of the converts, which, from the wording of <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5</a>, was evidently very great, elders (presbyters) being required in every city.<p>The task of organising the Church had been left for a season. We are ignorant of the circumstance which summoned the old Apostle from the scene of what seems to have been most successful labours. He left behind him one of the ablest of his disciples, Titus—a tried and well-known Christian leader of the second half of the first century—to organise the church life and to regulate the teaching of the powerful and numerous Christian community of Crete.<p>The Epistle addressed to Titus contains the formal credentials of his high office, stamping all his acts with the great name and authority of St. Paul; hence the careful and elaborate phraseology of the first four verses. Though addressed to one, they would have to be referred to and read often among the elders (<span class= "ital">presbyters</span>) and deacons in the various churches. St. Paul wrote the Letter, we are told, when on his way to Nicopolis to winter; we believe, soon after his arrival there he was arrested and sent to Rome to die. The date of this Letter, then, would be A.D. 65 or 66, and was probably written from some place in Asia Minor—perhaps Ephesus.<p><span class= "bld">That thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting.</span>—These words explain the “cause” of Titus’ appointment in Crete. The “things that are wanting” were what St. Paul meant, no doubt, to have done himself, but was prevented by being hurried away—for <span class= "ital">him</span> the end was nigh at hand. These “things” were want of church officials, lack of church government, want of cohesion between the churches of the island—in a word, there was plenty of Christian life, but no Christian organisation as yet in Crete. It was rather a number of Christian brotherhoods than one.<p><span class= "bld">And ordain elders in every city.</span>—The number of presbyters in each town or city is not specified, but is left to Titus’ judgment. We know that in some churches there were certainly several of these presbyters (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm" title="And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>). The words “in every city” point to the wide extension of Christianity at that early period in Crete.<p><span class= "bld">As I had appointed thee.</span>—Or better, <span class= "ital">as I gave thee directions.</span> These presbyters were to be most carefully selected, according to the special instructions Titus must remember St. Paul giving him in this important matter on some previous occasion. The more urgent of these qualifications for the presbyteral rank the Apostle now repeats for Titus’ guidance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/titus/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">For this cause left I thee in Crete </span>— Crete is one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean, being in length, from east to west, about 250 miles, in breadth about 50, and in circuit about 600; and anciently it must have been very populous, being famous for its 100 cities. It is now called Candia, from its chief city, which bears that name. In the year 1204 the Venetians took Canea, the second greatest city in Crete, and with it the whole island. That city they held till the year 1645, when the Turks conquered it, and almost entirely expelled the Venetians from Crete; and they have kept possession of it ever since. After the gospel was planted in Crete by the apostle and his assistant Titus, it took such deep root, and spread itself so widely through the island, that it has subsisted there ever since; and is at present the religion of the natives, who are in general of the Greek Church. These, on payment of a stated tribute to the Turks, are allowed the exercise of their religion without molestation. <span class="ital">That thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting </span>— That is, that thou shouldest perfect what was left unfinished at my departure, or mightest settle the affairs which I had not time to settle myself; <span class="ital">and ordain elders </span>— Pastors or teachers, the same with bishops, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm" title="For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;">Titus 1:7</a>; <span class="ital">in every city </span>— Where there are churches; <span class="ital">as I had appointed </span>— Or commanded thee.

Being such bishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God's stewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is great reason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, is plainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ, and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel. And here are described the spirit and practice becoming such as should be examples of good works.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/titus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this cause left I thee in Crete - Compare the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>. On the situation of Crete, see the Introduction, Section 2.<p>That thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting - Margin, "left undone." The Greek is: "the things that are left;" that is, those which were left unfinished; referring, doubtless, to arrangements which had been commenced, but which for some cause had been left incomplete. Whether this had occurred because he had been driven away by persecution, or called away by important duties demanding his attention elsewhere, cannot now be determined. The word rendered "set in order", &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;  epidiortho&#772;se&#772;, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, "to make straight upon, and then to put further to rights, to arrange further." Robinson, Lexicon - There were things left unfinished which he was to complete. One of these things, and perhaps the principal, was to appoint elders in the various cities where the gospel had been preached.<p>And ordain - The word "ordain" has now acquired a technical signification which it cannot be shown that it has in the New Testament. It means, in common usage, to "invest with a ministerial function or sacerdotal power; to introduce, and establish, and settle in the pastoral office with the customary forms and solemnities" (Webster); and it may be added, with the idea always connected with it, of the imposition of hands. But the word used here does not necessarily convey this meaning, or imply that Titus was to go through what would now be called an ordination service. It means to set, place, or constitute; then, to set over anything, as a steward or other officer (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>), though without reference to any particular mode of investment with an office; see the word, "ordain," explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>. Titus was to appoint or set them over the churches, though with what ceremony is now unknown. There is no reason to suppose that he did this except as the result of the choice of the people; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>.<p>Elders - Greek: Presbyters; see the word explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>. These "elders," or "Presbyters," were also called "bishops" (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>), for Paul immediately, in describing their qualifications, calls them bishops: - "ordain elders in every city - if any be blameless - for a bishop must be blameless," etc. If the elders and bishops in the times of the apostles were of different ranks, this direction would be wholly unmeaningful. It would be the same as if the following direction were given to one who was authorized to appoint officers over an army: "Appoint captains over each company, who shall be of good character, and acquainted with military tactics, for a Brigadier General must be of good character, and acquainted with the rules of war." - That the same rank is denoted also by the terms Presbyter and Bishop here, is further apparent because the qualifications which Paul states as requisite for the "bishop" are not those which pertain to a prelate or a diocesan bishop, but to one who was a pastor of a church, or an evangelist. It is clear, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>, that those whom Titus was to appoint were "bishops," and yet it is absurd to suppose that the apostle meant prelatical bishops, for no one can believe that such bishops were to be appointed in "every city" of the island. According to all modern notions of Episcopacy, one such bishop would have been enough for such an island as Crete, and indeed it has been not infrequently maintained that Titus himself was in fact the Bishop of that Diocese. But if these were not prelates who were to be ordained by Titus, then it is clear that the term "bishop" in the New Testament is given to the Presbyters or elders; that is, to all ministers of the gospel. That usage should never have been departed from.<p>In every city - Crete was anciently celebrated for the number of its cities. In one passage Homer ascribes to the island 100 cities (Iliad ii. 649), in another, 90 cities (Odyssey xix. 174). It may be presumed that many of these cities were towns of not very considerable size, and yet it would seem probable that each one was large enough to have a church, and to maintain the gospel. Paul, doubtless, expected that Titus would travel over the whole island, and endeavor to introduce the gospel in every important place.<p>As I had appointed thee - As I commanded thee, or gave thee direction - &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  dietaxame&#772;n - This is a different word from the one used in the former part of the verse - and rendered "ordain" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;  kathiste&#772;mi. It does not mean that Titus was to ordain elders in the same manner as Paul had ordained him, but that he was to set them over the cities as he had directed him to do. He had, doubtless, given him oral instructions, when he left him, as to the way in which it was to be done. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/titus/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. I left thee&#8212;"I left thee behind" [Alford] when I left the island: not implying permanence of commission (compare 1Ti 1:3).<p>in Crete&#8212;now Candia.<p>set in order&#8212;rather as Greek, "that thou mightest follow up (the work begun by me), setting right the things that are wanting," which I was unable to complete by reason of the shortness of my stay in Crete. Christianity, doubtless, had long existed in Crete: there were some Cretans among those who heard Peter's preaching on Pentecost (Ac 2:11). The number of Jews in Crete was large (Tit 1:10), and it is likely that those scattered in the persecution of Stephen (Ac 11:19) preached to them, as they did to the Jews of Cyprus, &c. Paul also was there on his voyage to Rome (Ac 27:7-12). By all these instrumentalities the Gospel was sure to reach Crete. But until Paul's later visit, after his first imprisonment at Rome, the Cretan Christians were without Church organization. This Paul began, and had commissioned (before leaving Crete) Titus to go on with, and now reminds him of that commission.<p>ordain&#8212;rather, "appoint," "constitute."<p>in every city&#8212;"from city to city."<p>as I &#8230; appointed thee&#8212;that is, as I directed thee; prescribing as well the act of constituting elders, as also the manner of doing so, which latter includes the qualifications required in a presbyter presently stated. Those called "elders" here are called "bishops" in Tit 1:7. Elder is the term of dignity in relation to the college of presbyters; bishop points to the duties of his office in relation to the flock. From the unsound state of the Cretan Christians described here, we see the danger of the want of Church government. The appointment of presbyters was designed to check idle talk and speculation, by setting forth the "faithful word."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/titus/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In Crete; </span> in Candia, as it is now called: see the Argument to this Epistle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Set in order the things that are wanting; </span> set to rights things which I left undone, being hastened away to other places. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</span> in this island we are told there were a hundred cities, in how many of them the gospel had taken place we are not told.

Not in his voyage to Rome, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-7.htm">Acts 27:7</a> but rather when he came from Macedonia into Greece, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2</a>. Crete is an island in the Mediterranean sea, now called Candy; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-11.htm">Acts 2:11</a>. Here Paul preached the Gospel to the conversion of many; but not having time to finish what he begun, left Titus here for that purpose: <p>that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting; that is, form the young converts into Gospel order, into a regular Gospel church state; settle a proper discipline among them; instruct them more largely into the doctrines of the Gospel; and correct their manners, and direct them in everything, both with respect to faith and practice: <p>and ordain elders in every city: for this island, though it was not above fifty miles in breadth, and two hundred and seventy in length, yet had an hundred cities in it (d); and it seems as if the Gospel had been preached in most, if not all of them, and churches were formed: however, in as many of them as there were churches, the apostle would have Titus see to it, and take care that they had proper officers fixed in them, particularly elders, pastors, or overseers, to preach the Gospel, and administer the ordinances to them, to watch over them in the Lord, and put the laws of Christ's house in execution, and keep up a strict discipline in it, according to the will of God. What Titus was to do in this affair, was to put the churches upon looking out, and choosing from among themselves proper persons for such service, and to direct, assist, and preside at the elections and ordinations of them: for we are not to suppose, that the ordination of elders was the sole act of Titus, or alone resided in him; but in like manner as Paul and Barnabas ordained elders in every church, by the suffrages of the people, signified by the stretching out of their hands; in which they directed, presided, and also assisted in prayer, with fasting, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a><p>as I had appointed thee; when he left him at Crete; when he gave him orders and instructions, both with respect to the persons, and their qualifications, whom he would have ordained, and with respect to the manner in which it should be done: the former of these he repeats in the following verses. From all which it clearly appears, that there were churches in Crete, and pastors placed over those churches; very probably the Cretes, who were at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-11.htm">Acts 2:11</a>, and heard Peter's sermon, and were converted by him, some of them returning to their own country, might first bring the Gospel to this island, and lay the foundation of a Gospel church state here. It seems by what is said in this text, that the Apostle Paul was in this island himself, and preached the Gospel, and after him Titus, whom he left behind; and if any credit is to be given to the subscription of this epistle, he was the first bishop of the church in it: and it is certain, that in the "second" century there were churches in this island, particularly at Gortyna, and other places, to whom Dionysius (e), bishop of Corinth, wrote letters, in which he greatly extols Philip their bishop; and in another letter of his to the Gnossians, or to the church at Gnossus, another city in Crete, he makes mention of Pinytus as their bishop, and whom he commends for his orthodox faith, great knowledge of divine things, and care of his flock; and both these lived in the times of the Emperors Antoninus Verus and Commodus (f); which churches, no doubt, continued in the "third" century, since in the "fourth" we read of bishops sent from Crete to the synod at Sardica: and in the "fifth" century, a bishop of Gortyna in Crete is reckoned among the bishops in the council of Chalcedon: and in the "sixth" century, Theodorus, bishop of the same place, subscribed in the fifth synod at Constantinople: and in the "seventh" century, Paul archbishop of Crete, Basil bishop of Gortyna, with several other bishops of churches in the island, were present at the sixth synod at Constantinople: and in the "eighth" century, as appears from the acts of the Nicene synod, Helias was bishop of Crete, Anastasius bishop of Gnossus, a city in it, and Melito, Leontins, and Galatas, bishops of other places in the same island: and in the "ninth" century, a bishop of Gortyna, in defence of the cause of Christ, became a martyr (g); so far churches, and bishops, bearing the Christian name, are to be traced in this island. <p>(d) Plin. l. 4. c. 12.

The meaning of ‘ordain’ in English of A.V. date is seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-32.htm" title="And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar.

It may have been by some of those "Cretes" who were at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost, and heard the apostles speak in their tongue "the wonderful works of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-11.htm">Acts 2:11</a>), or by other Christian Jews visiting the Jewish community in Crete (note to ver. 1). If St. Paul was returning from Spain, and travelling by ship eastward, Crete would be on his way. The importance of the island, with which he made some acquaintance on his voyage from Caesarea to Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-7.htm">Acts 27:7, 8</a>), and the large Jewish colony there, may naturally have inclined him to visit it. How long he remained there we do not know, but he did not stay long enough to organize the Church there completely. There were still things "wanting" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), as it follows. This mention of Crete is an important chronological mark. The order of St. Paul's progress, as gathered from the three pastoral Epistles, is very distinct - Crete, Miletus, Troas, Macedonia, Corinth, Nicopolis, Rome. He dropped Titus at Crete, and left Timothy behind at Ephesus. The Epistle to Titus, therefore, is the first of the three pastoral Epistles, and this is borne out by another circumstance. When he wrote to Titus he had not made up his mind whether he should send Artemas or Tychicus to take his place in Crete when he rejoined the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>). But when he wrote 2 Timothy he had sent Tychicus to Ephesus to replace Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>), and Titus had already joined him, and been sent on by him to Dalmatia, presumably from Nicopolis. <span class="cmt_word">Set in order</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX. nor in classical Greek, except as a technical word in the art of rhetoric. But <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is very common in classical Greek (<span class="accented">see</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). The force of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> in the compound here is "further," or "in addition." St. Paul had set the Church in order up to a certain point. But there were still certain things wanting, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-22.htm">Luke 18:22</a>); and these Titus was to supply and give the finishing touch to. <span class="cmt_word">Appoint</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>). This is a better rendering than the A.V. "ordain," because it is a general word for "to appoint, make." Probably the A.V. "ordain" was not intended to be taken in a strictly technical sense, but is used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-3.htm">Hebrews 8:3</a>. The technical word was usually "to order." "The Ordering of Deacons," or "of Priests," is the title of the service in the Book of Common Prayer. "Meet to be ordered," "shall surcease from ordering," occur repeatedly in the rubrics, <span class="cmt_word">Elders</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> presbyters, or priests (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">In every city</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); city by city. The phrase has a peculiar significance in Crete, which used to be famous for its hundred cities. It shows, too, that Christianity was widely spread among the cities of the island. The germ of the episcopal office, one bishop and many presbyters, is here very conspicuous. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/titus/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In Crete<p>Crete is one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean. By the mythological writers it was called Aeria, Doliche, Idaea, Telchinia. According to tradition, Minos first gave laws to the Cretans, conquered the Aegean pirates, and established a navy. After the Trojan war the principal cities of the island formed themselves into several republics, mostly independent. The chief cities were Cnossus, Cydonia, Gortyna, and Lyctus. Crete was annexed to the Romans Empire b.c. 67. About Paul's visiting the island we have no information whatever beyond the hints in this Epistle. There is no absolute proof that Paul was ever there before the voyage to Rome. Although on that voyage some time appears to have been spent at Crete, there is no notice of Paul having received any greeting from the members of the Christian churches there. According to this Epistle, Paul and Titus had worked there together. Paul went away, and left Titus to organize the churches founded by himself. He sent this letter by Zenas and Apollos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>), and announced in it the coming of Artemas or of Tychicus. On their arrival Titus was to join Paul at Nicopolis, where Paul was proposing to winter.<p>Shouldst set in order (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>N.T.o.
