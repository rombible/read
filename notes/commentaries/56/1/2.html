All gospel truth is according to godliness, teaching the fear of God. The intent of the gospel is to raise up hope as well as faith; to take off the mind and heart from the world, and to raise them to heaven and the things above. How excellent then is the gospel, which was the matter of Divine promise so early, and what thanks are due for our privileges! Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and whoso is appointed and called, must preach the word. Grace is the free favour of God, and acceptance with him. Mercy, the fruits of the favour, in the pardon of sin, and freedom from all miseries both here and hereafter. And peace is the effect and fruit of mercy. Peace with God through Christ who is our Peace, and with the creatures and ourselves. Grace is the fountain of all blessings.

This does not mean that Paul cherished the hope of eternal life, but that the "faith of the elect," which he aimed to secure, was in order that people might have the hope of eternal life. The whole system which he was appointed to preach was designed to secure to man a well-founded hope of salvation; compare the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>.<p>Which God, that cannot lie - On the phrase" cannot lie," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>. The fact that God cannot lie; that it is his nature always to speak the truth; and that no circumstances can ever occur in which He will depart from it, is the foundation of all our hopes of salvation.<p>Promised - The only hope of salvation is in the promise of God. It is only as we can have evidence that He has assured us that we may be saved, that we are authorized to cherish any hope of salvation. That promise is not made to us as individuals, or by name, but it becomes ours:<p>(1) because He has made a general promise that they who repent and believe shall be saved; and,<p>(2) because, we may have evidence that we have repented, and do believe the gospel. If this is so, we fairly come under the promise of salvation, and may apply it to ourselves.<p>Before the world began - That is, the purpose was then formed, and the promise may be considered as in fact then made; - for a purpose in the mind of God, though it is not as yet made known, is equivalent to a promise; compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/titus/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Or "for the hope of eternal life"; in order to bring souls to the hope of it. This is another end of the Gospel ministry, as to bring God's elect to faith in Christ, and to the knowledge and acknowledgement of the truth, as it is in Jesus, so to the hope of eternal glory and happiness: in a state of nature, they are without the grace of hope, or any true ground and foundation of it; and though it is the gift of God's grace, and is implanted on the soul by the Spirit of God in regeneration; yet the Gospel is the means of producing it at first, as well as afterwards encouraging and increasing it; for in it, Christ the foundation of hope is proposed, and set forth before awakened and convinced sinners: the object of this hope is "eternal life"; not anything now seen and enjoyed, for that is not hope; not anything in this present life, but something future; a life of perfect bliss and happiness with Christ to all eternity; which is a hope laid up in heaven, an inheritance reserved there; a life which is secured in the hands of Christ, which he has a power to give, and does give to all his sheep, and is the gift of God through him: and of which it is further said, <p>which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; eternal life is a "promise", and so of free grace, and not by the works of the law, which is inconsistent with a promise: it is the promise of God, who is faithful to his word, and "can not lie"; being the God of truth, that can neither deceive, nor be deceived: this does not contradict his omnipotence, but argues the perfection of his nature, which cannot admit of anything that implies weakness and mutation: and this promise was made before the world was, as early as the choice of God's elect in Christ, and the gift of grace to them in him; as early as the covenant was made with him, and he was set up as the Mediator of it; who was present to receive this promise as their head and representative for them, and to whom it was made as federally considered in him, and in whom it was secured for them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/titus/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> promised before the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> world began;</span><p>(c) Hope is the end of faith.<p>(d) Freely and only from his generosity.<p>(e) See Geneva 2Ti 1:9</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/titus/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm" title="In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;">Titus 1:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπʼ ἐλπίδι ζωῆς αἰωνίου</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐπʼ ἐλπίδι</span>, “in hope” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-18.htm" title="Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your seed be.">Romans 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Or said he it altogether for our sakes?

The force of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/26-5.htm" title="Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strait sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee....">Acts 26:5-6</a> comes out far more clearly if we keep ‘in hope’ there too, and understand St Paul to say ‘All the Jews know me; from a boy I have been a strict Pharisee; and today I am living <span class="ital">in hope</span> of the promise to our fathers as I stand here on my trial—the hope to which our twelve tribes look; and about this very hope I am called to account.’ Comparing the structure as well as the subject matter of that verse, we may well connect ‘in hope’ here with ‘Paul the Apostle’ before, and with ‘the message wherewith I was entrusted’ after. St Paul is still magnifying his office, as the emphatic <span class="ital">ego</span> shews. ‘My commission is threefold, and ranges from (1) the first spiritual life and gifts of those who have been chosen by God, through (2) the growing life of the true man of God thoroughly furnished, to (3) all the hope of glory; how your people in Crete may be justified, sanctified, glorified, is in the message wherewith I was entrusted; against this no Judaic formalism, no Gnostic spiritualism can hold: <span class="ital">I</span> have taught you (1) of the Holy Catholic Church; (2) of the Communion of saints and the Forgiveness of sins; (3) of the Resurrection of the body and the Life everlasting: and you are my true child after this common faith.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God, that cannot lie</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>; ‘God’s promise, and mine as His messenger, is very different from the Cretan teachers’ word’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a></span>).
