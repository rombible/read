In everything that was earnest and true, Titus ought to be the one showing an example to the rest; in peaceful, quiet days, as in times of danger and threatening, he must set the pattern—now of useful labour and toil—now of brave, patient endurance for the Lord’s sake.<p><span class= "bld">In doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity.</span>—The older authorities omit “sincerity.” Neither of the terms “uncorruptness” and “gravity” refers to the subject-matter of the “doctrine” or “teaching,” but to the bearing and behaviour of the “teacher.” While he occupies the place of a teacher, Titus must show in his life and conversation “uncorruptness”—<span class= "ital">apthoria, </span>the word found in the older authorities, the meaning of which differs very slightly from the word <span class= "ital">adiapthoria, </span>found in the received text. He must, in all those points of his life which are connected with his teaching, show a purity (<span class= "ital">chastity</span>) and freedom from all interested motives; he must be above seeking for popular applause; but besides this “uncorruptness,” in everything touching public instruction he must aim at a certain “gravity,” not only in his public delivery of sermons and lectures, but also in his general private intercourse with his flock. He must, in a word, never forget he is the chief teacher in the Church of Crete of his Master’s religion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/titus/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/2-7.htm" title="In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing soundness, gravity, sincerity,...">Titus 2:7-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">In all things </span>— In all these and other respects not here mentioned; <span class="ital">showing thyself a pattern of good works </span>— Of every thing amiable and excellent; of every disposition and practice which thou enjoinest to others.

That the aged men be sober; not thinking that the decays of nature will justify any excess; but seeking comfort from nearer communion with God, not from any undue indulgence. Faith works by, and must be seen in love, of God for himself, and of men for God's sake. Aged persons are apt to be peevish and fretful; therefore need to be on their guard. Though there is not express Scripture for every word, or look, yet there are general rules, according to which all must be ordered. Young women must be sober and discreet; for many expose themselves to fatal temptations by what at first might be only want of discretion. The reason is added, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. Failures in duties greatly reproach Christianity. Young men are apt to be eager and thoughtless, therefore must be earnestly called upon to be sober-minded: there are more young people ruined by pride than by any other sin. Every godly man's endeavour must be to stop the mouths of adversaries. Let thine own conscience answer for thine uprightness. What a glory is it for a Christian, when that mouth which would fain open itself against him, cannot find any evil in him to speak of!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/titus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works - Not merely teaching others, but showing them by example how they ought to live.

It means, here, the same as purity - that which is not erroneous, and which does not tend to corrupt or vitiate the morals of others, or to endanger their salvation. Everything in his teaching was to be such as to make men purer and better.<p>Gravity - See this word explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm">1 Timothy 2:2</a>, where it is rendered "honesty;" compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>, where it is rendered "gravity."

The word properly means "venerableness;" then, whatever will insure respect, in character, opinions, deportment. The sense here is, that the manner in which a preacher delivers his message, should be such as to command respect. He should evince good sense, undoubted piety, an acquaintance with his subject, simplicity, seriousness, and earnestness, in his manner.<p>Sincerity - See this word (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  aphtharsia) explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>.

It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means incorruption, incapacity of decay; and, therefore, would be here synonymous with purity. It should be said, however, that it is wanting in many msS, and is rejected in the later editions of the New Testament by Wetstein, Tittman, and Hahn. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/titus/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

It was not enough for Titus, and so neither for any other Gospel minister, to deliver out sound doctrine, and to exhort persons of different ages and sexes to the things which become it, but he should through the whole of his conversation be a pattern of every good work unto them; for they that are the shepherds of the flock, are not only to feed them with knowledge, and with understanding, but to be ensamples to them, as well as they who are under their care ought to walk, as they have them for an example; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>. <p>In doctrine, showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity; the apostle here either returns again to his advice about doctrine, that it should be delivered out pure and incorrupt, free from error and heresy, and every mixture and invention of man's; and with all gravity of speech and countenance, without levity in expression, and airiness of gesture; and that it be the sincere milk of the word that is given forth, and that with all integrity and uprightness of soul: or else this refers to the life and conversation of the teacher, as answering to his doctrine, and going along with it; and the sense is, in, or with doctrine, along with the doctrine preached, let the conversation be pure and incorrupt, free from the pollutions of the world, and from any governing vice; and let it be attended with gravity in word, gesture, look, and dress; and with all sincerity, faithfulness, and simplicity, in all our dealings, either with the saints, or with the men of the world. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/titus/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine <i>shewing</i> uncorruptness, <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> gravity, sincerity,</span><p>(3) The sixth admonition: that both the pastor's life and doctrine must be sound.<p>(b) Not such a gravity as may drive men from coming to the minister, but such as may cause them to come in a most reverent and honest way.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/titus/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/2-7.htm" title="In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing soundness, gravity, sincerity,...">Titus 2:7-8</a>.

Older as well as more recent expositors (Heydenreich, Mack, Wiesinger) refer the word here to the disposition: “purity of disposition;”[1] but it is more in accordance with the context to understand by it something immediately connected with the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΔΑΣΚΑΛΊΑ</span></span></span>, to which <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΕΜΝΌΤΗΤΑ</span></span></span> also refers. Matthies, de Wette, and others refer it (as does Luther also) to the subject-matter of the doctrine; de Wette: “incorruptness in doctrine, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> unadulterated doctrine.” But in that case it would mean the same thing as the following <span class="greekheb">λόγον ὑγιῆ</span>; there is no justification for Bengel’s interpreting <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΔΙΔΑΣΚΑΛΊᾼ</span></span></span> to mean <span class="ital">public</span> addresses, and <span class="greekheb">λόγον</span> the talk of daily intercourse. According to its original meaning, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΦΘΟΡΊΑ</span></span></span> is most suitably taken to mean chastity in doctrine, which avoids everything not in harmony with its true subject and aim, and it has a special reference to the form (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.">1 Corinthians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>).

See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm" title="The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;">Titus 2:3</a> and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-18.htm" title="That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;">1 Timothy 6:18</a>. Its exact force in St Paul’s mind seems to be an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a>, ‘let your <span class="ital">light shine</span> … that they <span class="ital">may see</span> your good works (<span class="ital">kalos</span>) and <span class="ital">glorify your Father</span>.’ The word <span class="ital">kalos</span> is ‘good to view as well as good within,’ <span class="ital">agathos</span>, ‘good in itself.’ Hence the two are joined to describe ‘a gentleman.’ The Christian religion was felt to be by this time on its trial before the world, and its works must be ‘fair and white’ in the fierce light of ill-wishing scrutiny, which ‘blackens every blot.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in doctrine</span> shewing <span class="ital">uncorruptness</span>] ‘Shewing’ is to be supplied from ‘shewing thyself’ as a second clause; again, <span class="bld">the doctrine</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm" title="For fornicators, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for enslavers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;">1 Timothy 1:10</a>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Uncorruptness’ joined with ‘gravity’ points to the absence of corruption ‘from the intrusion of a lower motive’ in the teacher; ‘with no doubtful motive and no doubtful manner.’ For this sense of ‘uncorruptness’ compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-5.htm" title="Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself.">1 Timothy 6:5</a>, ‘men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, whose motive in religion is gain.’ For ‘gravity’ as before compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm" title="For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.">1 Timothy 2:2</a>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a> the genitive is of the person to whom the example is given, in word, in conversation, etc., and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-3.htm">1 Peter 5:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Of good works</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>).
