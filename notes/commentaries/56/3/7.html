We were in a hopeless and lost state, from which God’s love for man saved us by the laver of regeneration and renovation; and this was the end for which He saved us—<span class= "ital">that we should be heirs of</span> <span class= "ital">eternal life.</span> “Being justified,” that is, freed from the future punishment and consequences of sin, and received into the favour and friendship of God, which favour and friendship had been, through sin, forfeited. “By His grace,” by the favour and kindness of God the Father are we restored to His love and friendship. “Heirs,” see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>, where this thought of our heirship of heaven is enlarged. “According to the hope of eternal life;” this life eternal is still for us in the future, though ever present in respect of hope; children of God we indeed are, and sharers in many a good gift of our Father, but eternal life, <span class= "ital">that</span> glorious inheritance, is still in the far future, and as yet can only be enjoyed by us in hope, but it is a sure hope—eternal life—the hope of which is the mainspring of all Christian work and activity—though it includes it, of course, is something far more than merely endless existence. A veil, impenetrable to mortal eye, hangs between us and the many mansions of the Father’s house. “It doth not yet appear what we shall be;” we only know that then, we, in company with an innumerable host of blessed beings, shall share in the beatific vision; we only know that then “we shall ever be with the Lord;” and that with this thought and with these words are we to comfort one another. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1Thessalonians 4:17-18</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 Spiritual privileges do not make void or weaken, but confirm civil duties. Mere good words and good meanings are not enough without good works. They were not to be quarrelsome, but to show meekness on all occasions, not toward friends only, but to all men, though with wisdom, Jas 3:13. And let this text teach us how wrong it is for a Christian to be churlish to the worst, weakest, and most abject. The servants of sin have many masters, their lusts hurry them different ways; pride commands one thing, covetousness another. Thus they are hateful, deserving to be hated. It is the misery of sinners, that they hate one another; and it is the duty and happiness of saints to love one another. And we are delivered out of our miserable condition, only by the mercy and free grace of God, the merit and sufferings of Christ, and the working of his Spirit. God the Father is God our Saviour. He is the fountain from which the Holy Spirit flows, to teach, regenerate, and save his fallen creatures; and this blessing comes to mankind through Christ. The spring and rise of it, is the kindness and love of God to man. Love and grace have, through the Spirit, great power to change and turn the heart to God. Works must be in the saved, but are not among the causes of their salvation. A new principle of grace and holiness is wrought, which sways, and governs, and makes the man a new creature. Most pretend they would have heaven at last, yet they care not for holiness now; they would have the end without the beginning. Here is the outward sign and seal thereof in baptism, called therefore the washing of regeneration. The work is inward and spiritual; this is outwardly signified and sealed in this ordinance. Slight not this outward sign and seal; yet rest not in the outward washing, but look to the answer of a good conscience, without which the outward washing will avail nothing. The worker therein is the Spirit of God; it is the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Through him we mortify sin, perform duty, walk in God's ways; all the working of the Divine life in us, and the fruits of righteousness without, are through this blessed and holy Spirit. The Spirit and his saving gifts and graces, come through Christ, as a Saviour, whose undertaking and work are to bring to grace and glory. Justification, in the gospel sense, is the free forgiveness of a sinner; accepting him as righteous through the righteousness of Christ received by faith. God, in justifying a sinner in the way of the gospel, is gracious to him, yet just to himself and his law. As forgiveness is through a perfect righteousness, and satisfaction is made to justice by Christ, it cannot be merited by the sinner himself. Eternal life is set before us in the promise; the Spirit works faith in us, and hope of that life; faith and hope bring it near, and fill with joy in expectation of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/titus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That being justified by his grace - Not by our own works, but by his favor or mercy; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>.<p>We should be made heirs - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>.<p>According to the hope of eternal life - In reference to the hope of eternal life; that is, we have that hope in virtue of our being adopted with the family of God, and being made heirs.

Bengel and Ellicott explain it, "heirs of eternal life, in the way of hope," that is, not yet in actual possession. Such a blessed hope, which once was not possessed, will lead a Christian to practice holiness and meekness toward others, the lesson especially needed by the Cretans.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/titus/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That being justified by his grace; </span> that, through the free love of God, having the guilt of our sins removed, and the righteousness of Christ reckoned to us for righteousness, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">we should be made heirs; </span> should, through adoption, be made <span class="ital">children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to the hope of eternal life:</span> some think that the words should be read thus: That we, according to hope, should be made heirs of eternal life; because otherwise, the text hath no object to relate to heirs.

This is another way and means, as well as regeneration, by which God saves his people; for he saves no unjustified ones; no unrighteous persons shall inherit the kingdom of heaven; such as are without the wedding garment, and robe of Christ's righteousness, shall be cast into outer darkness: whom God saves, he justifies by the righteousness of his Son; and whomsoever he justifies, them he saves. The justification here spoken of is a declarative one, which takes place in regeneration; and which that is in order to, as here expressed, "that being justified": regeneration does not justify any, but makes the justified to appear to be such; justification is an act of God's gracious will conceived in his mind from eternity, by which he wills not to impute sin to his people, but to Christ their surety; and that they should be accounted righteous through the righteousness of his Son; in which act of his will the whole essence of justification in his sight lies: this was pronounced on Christ, as their head and representative at his resurrection, when he, as such, was justified, acquitted, and discharged, and they in him; and this is declared in the conscience of a sinner, by the Spirit of God, at his regeneration, when he passes from death to life; and this declaration is here intended, and which is the same with justification by faith; and is here said to be by the grace of God, as justification in every view is, and stands opposed to works of righteousness done by men, by which no man can be justified in the sight of God; in what sense justification is by the free grace of God; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>. <p>We should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life; or "according to hope we should be made heirs of eternal life". Eternal life is an inheritance, and so is not acquired by labour and industry, nor purchased, but is a free gift; it is a bequest of God the Father to his children, of his own free good will and pleasure; and it belongs only to children; they only are heirs, and they become such by adopting grace; neither regeneration, nor justification, make them the children of God, and heirs of the grace of life, but make them appear to be so: God, by his gracious act of adoption puts them among the children, and gives them the goodly heritage; and this adoption lies in eternal predestination in Christ, in whom the inheritance is obtained on that account, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>. Regeneration shows them to be the adopted ones, and gives them the nature of children, and a meetness for the inheritance; and justification gives them a right unto it, upon the foot of justice, and opens a way for their enjoyment of it, consistent with the justice and holiness of God; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, wherefore such as are washed with the washing of regeneration, and are renewed in the spirit of their minds, and justified by the grace of God; these are manifestly heirs of eternal life, of salvation, of a kingdom and glory, of all things, even of God himself, who is their portion, and exceeding great reward; and such in regeneration are begotten to a lively hope of it, and by this they are saved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>. And thus the apostle makes regeneration by the free mercy of God, and justification by his grace, and special adoption, and heirship, with a good hope through grace, the way and means in which God saves his people, who were like others by nature, and brings them to the enjoyment of eternal happiness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/titus/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/titus/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm" title="That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.">Titus 3:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα</span> declares the purpose, not the consequence. It is doubtful whether it belongs to <span class="greekheb">ἐξέχεεν</span> (Heydenreich, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Plitt, Hofmann) or to <span class="greekheb">ἔσωσεν</span> as defined by <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ λουτροῦ</span> … <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν</span> (Bengel, de Wette, and others). The thought is substantially the same with both constructions, since the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> is necessarily brought about by the outpouring of the Spirit. Still the structure of the sentence is in favour of the reference to <span class="greekheb">ἐξέχεεν</span>. Wiesinger rightly considers the other view “to be unnecessarily harsh, ignoring the explanatory relation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/3-6.htm" title="Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior;...">Titus 3:6-7</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>, and depriving <span class="greekheb">ἐξέχεεν</span> of its necessary definition.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δικαιωθέντες</span>] not “found righteous” (Matthies), still less “sanctified,” but “justified,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> “acquitted of the guilt, and with it, of the punishment.” Hofmann rightly says that this justification means the same thing as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>; that it does not mean the change of our conduct towards God, but of our relations to Him.1[18]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῇ ἘΚΕΊΝΟΥ ΧΆΡΙΤΙ</span></span></span>] does not belong to what follows, but to what precedes.

Chrysostom has two interpretations: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤʼ ἘΛΠΊΔΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΤΟΥΤΈΣΤΙ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΘῺς ἨΛΠΊΣΑΜΕΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΟὝΤΩς ἈΠΟΛΑΎΣΟΜΕΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἢ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὍΤΙ ἬΔΗ ΚΑῚ ΚΛΗΡΟΝΌΜΟΙ ἘΣΤΈ</span></span></span>. According to the former view, the words would have to be translated: “in order that we, in proportion to our hope (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> as we hope), may become heirs of eternal life;” according to the latter, it would be: “that we, according to hope, might become heirs of eternal life.” The latter view is the correct one. The apostle is speaking not of the future, but of the present condition of believers. They <span class="ital">are</span> heirs of eternal life; but they are so in hope, not yet in actual possession; for <span class="greekheb">ζωὴ αἰώνιος</span> in its full meaning is something future, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-22.htm" title="But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life....">Romans 6:22-23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤʼ ἘΛΠΊΔΑ</span></span></span> stands here as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῇ ἘΛΠΊΔΙ</span></span></span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?">Romans 8:24</a>; see Meyer on the passage.[19]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[18] 1 The apostle says nothing here regarding the relation of justification to the <span class="greekheb">ἀνακαίνωσις</span> wrought by the Holy Spirit. It is wrong at any rate to regard the latter as the ground of the former, so that God justifies man because he is renewed. Nor, on the other hand, can the renewing be regarded as a later consequence of the justification, in the sense that God imparts to man the Holy Spirit after man has been justified. The two things are very closely connected. Justification is to be regarded as the ground of renewing, while renewing is the actual completion of justification. God justifies man so as to renew him, to make him His child born of the Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[19] This passage, vv. 4–7, is substantially different from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/2-11.htm" title="For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,...">Titus 2:11-14</a>. While in the latter the chief point is the paedagogic aim of the work of redemption, and the apostle accordingly is thinking how Christians are pledged to a holy life, in the former the chief point is the undeserved love of God made manifest in the work of redemption. Hence in this passage also much emphasis is laid on the idea of regeneration, which is granted to the Christian by the gift of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/titus/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm" title="That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.">Titus 3:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: It is not quite certain, whether this expresses the object of <span class="greekheb">ἐξέχεεν</span> or of <span class="greekheb">ἔσωσεν</span>. The former connexion brings out best the climax of the passage. <span class="greekheb">κληρονόμοι</span> marks the highest point to which man can attain in this life. See reff.

The term would not need any elucidation to one of St. Paul’s company. It is also an argument against connecting <span class="greekheb">κληρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ζωῆς αἰωνίου</span> (R.V.m) that <span class="greekheb">ἔλπις ζωῆς αἰωνίου</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm" title="In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;">Titus 1:2</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm" title="And if you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.">Galatians 3:29</a>, <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐπαγγελίαν κληρ</span>., is parallel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/titus/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">being justified … be made heirs</span>] The word ‘justifying’ and ‘justification’ occur 25 times in the great group of Epistles, written 10 years before this to the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, whose subject is ‘Christ the Redeemer,’ ‘Christ for us.’ It has not been used in the next great group written five years before this, to the Ephesians, Colossians and Philippians, whose subject is ‘Christ the Life,’ ‘Christ in us,’ ‘Christ our Sanctification.’ ‘Righteousness,’ however, that right relation between God and man, the restoration to which <span class="ital">is</span> justification, occurs seven times against 50 times in the former group. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a> (already quoted as parallel in form and sense to our present passage), ‘the cleansing’ <span class="ital">is</span> the justifying, and the ‘sanctifying’ follows, as here ‘being heirs’ follows. This verse then, in its two clauses, repeats, with reference to God the Son, what in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a> was said with reference to God the Father as to the twofold saving mercy; just as in the former ‘Gospel’ passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/2-11.htm" title="For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,...">Titus 2:11-14</a>, ‘renunciation’ and ‘obedience’ are both spoken of, first as the work of God the Father’s grace (11, 12), and then as the result of God the Son’s gift of Himself (14). The justification by God the Father’s grace—the regeneration—effected potentially once for all by Christ through His death, resurrection and outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and appropriated individually by Faith (expressed or implied) in Baptism, is to be followed by a ‘life of heirship’ or ‘sanctification’; so the Latin translation of Theod.

(2) The R.V. margin gives ‘heirs, according to hope, of eternal life.’ in this case ‘eternal life’ must most fittingly be interpreted as usually in St John, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm" title="For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.">1 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-19.htm" title="Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.">1 Timothy 6:19</a>, ‘the spiritual life that is and is to come;’ ‘according to hope,’ will be as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4</a>, ‘called in one hope of your calling,’ and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;">1 Timothy 1:1</a>, ‘Christ Jesus our hope,’ where this life’s state of salvation must be included in the object of hope; and ‘justification’ and ‘sanctification’ will be the only two objects named of the Spirit’s outpouring. But the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm" title="In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;">Titus 1:2</a>, as there interpreted, favours (1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/titus/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm" title="That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.">Titus 3:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) This depends on <span class="ital">He saved</span>.—<span class="greekheb">δικαιωθέντες</span>, <span class="ital">being justified</span>) For formerly we were without <span class="ital">righteousness</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκείνου</span>, <span class="ital">His</span>) God’s, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/3-4.htm" title="But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,...">Titus 3:4-5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος</span>, <span class="ital">He, or that person</span>, points often to something remote. That which is more remote (as expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος</span>) is estimated from the position of the words, not exactly from the thought itself. The <span class="ital">grace of God</span> is an ordinary phrase; and it is of that grace that the <span class="ital">kindness and love to men</span> have appeared, to which all things are here attributed. God is supremely good, we are exceedingly evil.—<span class="greekheb">χάριτι</span>, <span class="ital">by grace</span>) An antithesis to <span class="ital">works</span>.—<span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐλπίδα</span>, <span class="ital">according to the hope</span>) which we did not formerly possess.

The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>, "<span class="accented">In</span> hope of eternal life," is a very strong reason for taking the same construction here. The answer in the Church Catechism, "<span class="accented">Wherein</span> I was made a member of Christ, a child of God, and an <span class="accented">inheritor</span> of the kingdom of heaven," follows very closely St. Paul's teaching in the text (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29, 4</a>:7). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/titus/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Being justified (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>In Pastorals only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a> (note).
