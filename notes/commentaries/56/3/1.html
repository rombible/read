But, with the exception of a slight digression in the case of a slave to a Pagan master, his words had been written with a reference generally to Christian life among <span class= "ital">Christians.</span> But there was then a great life outside the little Christian world; how were the people of Christ to regulate their behaviour in their dealings with the vast Pagan world outside? St. Paul goes to the root of the matter at once when he says, “Put them in mind,” &c. Very needful in Crete was such a reminder respecting obedience. The island had, when St. Paul wrote to Titus, been some century and a quarter under Roman rule. Their previous government had been democratic; and historians, like Polybius, who have written of Crete, have dwelt particularly on the turbulent and factious spirit which animated their people; added to which, the many Jews who we know formed a very large part of the Christian Church there, always impatient of a foreign yoke, would in such an atmosphere of excitement be especially eager to assert their right to be free from the hated rule of Rome.<p>The Greek words translated “principalities and powers” are better rendered here by “rulers and authorities,” as the word “principalities” is used occasionally in the English version for an “order of angels.” The terms include all constituted governors and officials, Roman and otherwise, in the island.<p><span class= "bld">To obey magistrates.</span>—Taken absolutely, <span class= "ital">to obey the temporal power.</span> Our Lord’s words were the model for all teaching in this division of Christian ethics One great teacher after the other, in the same spirit, in varied language, urges upon the people of Christ a reverence and submission to all legally constituted authority in the state. This devoted Christian loyalty, no bitter opposition in after years to their tenets could chill, no cruel persecution of individuals lessen. Augustine, writes Professor Reynolds, could boast that when Julian asked Christians to sacrifice and offer incense to the gods they, at all hazards, sternly refused; but when he summoned them to fight for the empire they rushed to the front. “They distinguished between their Eternal Lord and their earthly ruler, and yet they yielded obedience to their earthly ruler for the sake of their Eternal Lord.” Least of any should we expect St. Paul to write such words, so loyal and faithful to Rome. He had found, indeed, little cause in his chequered, troubled life to be grateful personally to the Empire; with ears too ready had Rome ever listened to the cruel “informations” laid against him by his implacable Jewish enemies; she had imprisoned him, fettered him, hindered his work, and threatened his life; and when he was writing these deathless words of his, urging upon his devoted flock a loyalty changeless and true, for him the supreme vengeance of Rome was close at hand.<p><span class= "bld">To be ready to every good work.</span>—Ready cheerfully to aid all lawful authority, municipal and otherwise, in their public works undertaken for city or state. The flock of Titus must remember that the true Christian ought to be known as a good citizen and a devoted patriot.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/titus/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/3-1.htm" title="Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,...">Titus 3:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Put them. </span>— All the Cretian Christians; <span class="ital">in mind to be subject</span> — Passively, not resisting; <span class="ital">to principalities </span>— Supreme rulers; <span class="ital">and powers</span> — Subordinate governors; and <span class="ital">to obey magistrates </span>— Actively, as far as conscience permits. It is probable that the reason whey the apostle enjoined this so particularly was, because the Judaizing teachers in Crete affirmed, that no obedience was due from the worshippers of the true God to magistrates who were idolaters, and because by that doctrine they were beginning to make not only the Jewish, but the Gentile believers, bad subjects, and liable to be punished as evil-doers. <span class="ital">To be ready to every good work </span>— In every relation which they sustain; <span class="ital">to speak evil of no man </span>— Neither of magistrates, nor of any others. “The word <span class="greekheb">βλασφημειν</span>, besides <span class="ital">evil-speaking, </span>denotes all those vices of the tongue which proceed either from hatred or from contempt of others, and which tend to hurt their reputation, such as railing, reviling, mocking speeches, whisperings, &c.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">To be no brawlers </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">αμαχους ειναι</span>, <span class="ital">not to be contentious: </span>or quarrelsome, to assault none; <span class="ital">but gentle </span>— <span class="greekheb">Επεικεις</span>, <span class="ital">yielding, </span>when assaulted, and often giving up their own right rather than contend; <span class="ital">showing</span> — In their tempers, words, and actions; <span class="ital">all meekness </span>— A mild, inoffensive, and kind behaviour; <span class="ital">unto all men </span>— Even enemies, and such as we ourselves once were. <span class="ital">For we ourselves also </span>— Or, <span class="ital">even we ourselves, </span>though now new creatures in Christ Jesus; <span class="ital">were sometimes, </span><span class="greekheb">ποτε</span>, <span class="ital">formerly, foolish </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ανοητοι</span>, <span class="ital">ignorant, </span>of God and divine things; unreasonable, particularly in rejecting the Lord Jesus, though demonstrated to be the true Messiah by the most incontrovertible evidences; and imprudent, or destitute of true wisdom, (as the word also implies,) being enemies to ourselves, in that we were <span class="ital">disobedient </span>to the divine commands, though <span class="ital">holy, just, and good; </span>and refused to hearken to the glad tidings of salvation announced in the gospel of his grace. The cause of this unreasonable and foolish conduct was, that we were <span class="ital">deceived </span>by the grand enemy of our souls, the subtle serpent that lies in wait to deceive; deluded by the allurements of this insnaring world, and <span class="ital">erred, </span>or <span class="ital">wandered, </span>(as the word <span class="greekheb">πλανωμενοι </span>means,) from the right way of truth and righteousness into by-paths of error and sin, promising ourselves liberty; but <span class="ital">serving </span>— <span class="greekheb">Δουλευοντες</span>, <span class="ital">enslaved to, divers lusts </span>— <span class="greekheb">Επιθυμιαις</span>, <span class="ital">desires, </span>irregular and inordinate; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-12.htm" title="Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;">Titus 2:12</a>;) <span class="ital">and pleasures </span>— Which perished in the using, but nevertheless were alluring us forward to everlasting miseries. Such was the state of our understanding, will, and affections. But what were our tempers? Such was our conduct toward God and ourselves; but what was it toward our fellow-creatures? The apostle tells us: <span class="ital">living in malice </span>— Instead of exercising benevolence and love toward all men; <span class="ital">and envy </span>— Grieving at the good enjoyed by others, instead of rejoicing therein, as it was our duty to have done; <span class="ital">hateful </span>— Ourselves, while under the tyranny of such detestable passions, worthy to be abhorred by God and man; <span class="ital">and hating one another </span>— On account of little clashings and oppositions in our temporal interests, while we forgot the great ties and bonds which ought to have endeared us to each other. Dr. Whitby, arguing from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm" title="Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.">Php 3:6</a>, pleads that the above description could not be applicable to Paul himself, even while he was in his unconverted state; and with him Dr. Macknight agrees; forgetting, it seems, the malicious and vengeful passions which evidently dwelt in him while he was <span class="ital">Saul the persecutor, breathing out threatenings and slaughter </span>against the best people upon earth, the disciples of the Lord Jesus; <span class="ital">binding and delivering into prisons both men and women, and being exceedingly mad against them, punishing them oft in every synagogue, pursuing them into strange cities, and persecuting them even unto death, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-1.htm" title="And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,">Acts 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm" title="And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.">Acts 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-11.htm" title="And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to strange cities.">Acts 26:11</a>. On account of which conduct, when the eyes of his understanding were opened by the wonderful miracle of grace which the Lord Jesus wrought for him, he always reckoned himself <span class="ital">the chief of sinners. </span>But besides the persecuting spirit which he manifested toward the Christians, when he had a just view of his temper and behaviour in other respects, and became acquainted with the purity of God’s holy law, he was so convinced of the depravity of his nature, and of the imperfection of his best obedience, that, notwithstanding all he says in the passages above quoted by Whitby, he could undoubtedly, as Dr. Doddridge justly observes, “apply what he here wrote to much of his own character while an enemy to Christianity.” The reader will easily see that the duty inculcated in this passage is highly reasonable, and of peculiar importance, namely, that we should be ready to show that mercy to others which God hath shown to us; and that, from a recollection of the errors and sins which we were chargeable with in our unconverted state, we should exercise compassion toward those who are still ignorant and out of the way, but who may hereafter be brought to the saving knowledge of the truth, and be created anew in Christ Jesus, as we have been.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 Spiritual privileges do not make void or weaken, but confirm civil duties. Mere good words and good meanings are not enough without good works. They were not to be quarrelsome, but to show meekness on all occasions, not toward friends only, but to all men, though with wisdom, Jas 3:13. And let this text teach us how wrong it is for a Christian to be churlish to the worst, weakest, and most abject. The servants of sin have many masters, their lusts hurry them different ways; pride commands one thing, covetousness another. Thus they are hateful, deserving to be hated. It is the misery of sinners, that they hate one another; and it is the duty and happiness of saints to love one another. And we are delivered out of our miserable condition, only by the mercy and free grace of God, the merit and sufferings of Christ, and the working of his Spirit. God the Father is God our Saviour. He is the fountain from which the Holy Spirit flows, to teach, regenerate, and save his fallen creatures; and this blessing comes to mankind through Christ. The spring and rise of it, is the kindness and love of God to man. Love and grace have, through the Spirit, great power to change and turn the heart to God. Works must be in the saved, but are not among the causes of their salvation. A new principle of grace and holiness is wrought, which sways, and governs, and makes the man a new creature. Most pretend they would have heaven at last, yet they care not for holiness now; they would have the end without the beginning. Here is the outward sign and seal thereof in baptism, called therefore the washing of regeneration. The work is inward and spiritual; this is outwardly signified and sealed in this ordinance. Slight not this outward sign and seal; yet rest not in the outward washing, but look to the answer of a good conscience, without which the outward washing will avail nothing. The worker therein is the Spirit of God; it is the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Through him we mortify sin, perform duty, walk in God's ways; all the working of the Divine life in us, and the fruits of righteousness without, are through this blessed and holy Spirit. The Spirit and his saving gifts and graces, come through Christ, as a Saviour, whose undertaking and work are to bring to grace and glory. Justification, in the gospel sense, is the free forgiveness of a sinner; accepting him as righteous through the righteousness of Christ received by faith. God, in justifying a sinner in the way of the gospel, is gracious to him, yet just to himself and his law. As forgiveness is through a perfect righteousness, and satisfaction is made to justice by Christ, it cannot be merited by the sinner himself. Eternal life is set before us in the promise; the Spirit works faith in us, and hope of that life; faith and hope bring it near, and fill with joy in expectation of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/titus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Put them in mind to be subject ... - See the duty here enjoined, explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, following.<p>Principalities and powers - See these words explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>.

Put them in mind&#8212;as they are in danger of forgetting their duty, though knowing it. The opposition of Christianity to heathenism, and the natural disposition to rebellion of the Jews under the Roman empire (of whom many lived in Crete), might lead many to forget practically what was a recognized Christian principle in theory, submission to the powers that be.

Compare Ro 13:3, as showing that obedience to the magistracy would tend to good works, since the magistrate's aim generally is to favor the good and punish the bad.

Not angels, good or bad, which are sometimes so called, but men in high places; the higher powers ordained of God, as the apostle elsewhere calls them; and which the Apostle Peter distinguishes into the king as supreme, and into governors under him: the Roman emperor and senate, the consuls, and proconsuls, deputies and governors of provinces and islands, are here meant; particularly such who were appointed over the island of Crete. Now the reasons why the apostle exhorts Titus to put in remembrance those that were under his care, to yield a cheerful subjection to their superiors, were, because the Jews, from whom the Christians were not distinguished by the Romans, were reckoned a turbulent and seditious people; which character they obtained, partly through the principles of the Scribes and Pharisees, which they at least privately entertained, as not to give tribute to Caesar, or be under any Heathen yoke; and partly through the insurrections that had been made by Judas of Galilee, and Theudas, and others; and besides, there were many Jews in the island of Crete, and the Cretians themselves were prone to mutiny and rebellion: to which may be added, that the false teachers, and judaizing preachers, that had got among them, despised dominion, and were not afraid to speak evil of dignities, according to the characters which both Peter and Jude give of them, and taught the saints to abuse their Christian liberty, and use it for a cloak of maliciousness, to the great scandal of the Christian religion. <p>To obey magistrates; inferior ones; in all things that are according to the laws of God, and right reason, that do not contradict what God has commanded, or break in upon the rights and dictates of conscience; in all things of a civil nature, and which are for the good of society, and do not affect religion, and the worship of God: hence it follows, <p>to be ready to every good work; which may be taken in a limited and restrained sense, and design every good work enjoined by the civil magistrate; and all right and lawful obedience that belongs to him, as giving to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, tribute, custom, fear, and honour to whom they are due; and which should be done readily and cheerfully: or it may be understood more comprehensively of good works in general, which wicked men are reprobate to, and unfit for; and which they that are sanctified are meet for, and ready to; though this may not only intend their capacity, fitness, and qualifications, for the performance of good works, but their alacrity, promptitude, and forwardness unto them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/titus/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Put <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</span><p>(1) He declares particularly and separately that which he said before generally, noting out certain main and principal duties which men owe to men, and especially subjects to their magistrates.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/titus/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/3-1.htm" title="Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,...">Titus 3:1-2</a>.

It cannot, however, be shown that the one denotes the higher, the other the lower authorities (Heydenreich). It is at least doubtful whether this inculcation of obedience to the authorities had its justification in the rebellious character of the Cretans nationally (Matthies and others). Similar precepts also occur in other epistles of the N. T.; and here the exhortation harmonizes with the injunctions given in chap. 2. The Christians needed the exhortation all the more that the authorities were heathen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πειθαρχεῖν</span>] here in its original signification: “<span class="ital">obey the superior</span>.” Its meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-21.htm" title="But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the middle of them, and said, Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.">Acts 27:21</a> is more general.

The verb for ‘put in mind,’ and its substantive, occur twice in St John, once in St Luke, but in St Paul only in the Pastoral Epistles three times; in St Peter’s Epistles three times; and once in St Jude’s. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a> shews the full construction, accus. of person and of thing, ‘He shall bring all things to your remembrance.’ The A.V. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-10.htm" title="Why, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.">3 John 1:10</a>, ‘I will remember his deeds,’ is surely in the old sense of ‘remember,’ which survives in our valedictory request ‘remember me to all your circle;’ R.V. ‘bring to remembrance,’ cf. note on the similar compound <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm" title="Why I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands.">2 Timothy 1:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to be subject to principalities and powers</span>] Rather, more fully as R.V. <span class="bld">to be in subjection</span>. Elsewhere in St Paul’s Epistles the phrase ‘principalities and powers’ refers to spiritual and angelic powers, good or evil, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>. But the word in its old sense (see <span class="ital">Bible Word-Book</span>, p. 477) was used of any ‘chief place,’ as in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-27.htm" title="So Menelaus got the principality: but as for the money that he had promised unto the king, he took no good order for it, albeit Sostratis the ruler of the castle required it:">2Ma 4:27</a> of the office of high priest. And the meaning here is the same as in the two places where it occurs in the Gospels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-11.htm" title="And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and powers, take you no thought how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say:">Luke 12:11</a>, where our Lord prophesies that His disciples shall be brought before ‘the rulers and the authorities,’ and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-20.htm" title="And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.">Luke 20:20</a>, ‘so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.’ There is not sufficient warrant for the connecting ‘and’ here; render <span class="bld">to rulers to authorities</span>. Both words illustrate the idiom ‘res pro persona.’ Vulg. ‘potestates’ from whence the Italian <span class="ital">podestà</span> a magistrate. The difference between the two words is that the former expresses a governing <span class="ital">de facto</span>, whether also <span class="ital">de jure</span> or not, the latter a governing <span class="ital">de jure</span>, a duly constituted authority. ‘They who rule’ occurs with ‘the authorities’ in the <span class="ital">locus classicus</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1</a>, where, however, R.V. has retained ‘power,’ apparently because <span class="ital">from that passage</span> the phrase ‘the powers that be’ has become an English household word in the sense of ‘lawful authority.’ The other household use of ‘powers’ in the phrase ‘The Great Powers,’ seems to belong rather to the synonym <span class="ital">dynamis</span> as expressing material force. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm" title="And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.">Matthew 28:18</a> the change from ‘power’ to ‘authority’ in R.V. enhances the kingly office and prerogative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to obey magistrates</span>] The word only occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm" title="Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.">Acts 5:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-32.htm" title="And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God has given to them that obey him.">Acts 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-21.htm" title="But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the middle of them, and said, Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.">Acts 27:21</a>, where a dative follows; and so it may be here, if we join it with the preceding; but it seems more Pauline to add the verb absolutely. From note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm" title="To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.">Titus 2:5</a> we should expect it to differ from the preceding clause, in being more specific in its reference to the official system of government; render perhaps <span class="bld">to obey their rules</span>, ‘to obey state laws.’ Fairbairn refers to the earlier history of the island and a ‘known tendency on the part of the Cretans to insubordination and turmoil,’ quoting from Polybius vi. 46, ‘constantly upset by seditions and murders and tribal wars.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to be ready to every good work</span>] This takes us on a step still further; first a general submission, then a loyal acceptance and execution of public orders, then the learning and labouring truly to get one’s own living and to do one’s duty, domestic, social and civil. That ‘the good work’ has such a reference is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-3.htm" title="For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:">Romans 13:3</a>. The ‘ready’ is exactly ‘whatsover ye do, do it heartily unto the Lord,’ cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-23.htm" title=" And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;">Colossians 3:23</a>. ‘The true workman never shirks when the overseer is not by; he has not one rule for work done for himself, and another for work done for his master. There is a work that is mean and pitiful; all grudging unwilling toil, all ‘scamped’ work, fair to the eye but second rate in reality, is mean and pitiful; it is like work done by the slave at the whip’s end, or like the labour of the convict in gaol; it is forced and unwelcome and as badly done as possible.’ M.

It occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>. In all the above examples the words, it is true, apply to the angelic hosts, but the words are elsewhere applied separately to human government, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20</a>, they are applied together to the authority of the Roman governor. <span class="cmt_word">To be obedient</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-21.htm">Acts 27:21</a>.

The simple "<span class="accented">to</span> be obedient" of the Revised Version does not express the sense. <span class="cmt_word">To be ready unto every good work.</span> St. Paul is still speaking with especial reference to magistrates and the civil power. Christians were to show themselves good citizens, always ready for any duty to which they were called. Christianity was not to be an excuse for shirking duties, or refusing obedience where it was due. The only limit is expressed by the word "good." They were to give tribute to whom tribute was due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor; but, if ordered to do evil, then they must resist, and obey God rather than man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>).
