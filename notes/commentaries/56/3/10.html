The term “heresies” occurs twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.">1Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>). In neither, however, of these passages does the word signify there a fundamental or doctrinal error. This sense belongs to a usage of later times. From the meaning of the word “heresy” in these passages of St. Paul, we are able to deduce the signification of the term “heretic” here. The “heretic” of the Church in Crete appears to have been a man who, dissatisfied with the organisation and discipline introduced by Titus into the Christian community—not improbably considering himself in some way slighted—withdrew himself from the common body, and gathering round him other discontented spirits, established what might be termed a rival Church in Crete. Although at first, perhaps, no marked erroneous teaching forms part of the practice of such schismatics, still the tendency in such small rival communities is ever more and more to distinguish between <span class= "ital">their</span> teaching and that of the larger body from whom they, in the first instance, cut themselves adrift.<p><span class= "bld">After the first and second admonition reject.</span>—The Greek word rendered “reject” would be more accurately translated <span class= "ital">shun, </span>or <span class= "ital">avoid.</span> There was, no doubt, some self-willed factious party leader in Crete well known to St. Paul to whom he referred here; but partly out of a loving hope that Titus would win him to his side, partly from the knowledge that this Letter was a public instruction to many a Church besides that of Crete, the disturber remained nameless. He was <span class= "ital">to</span> be exhorted once, twice, and then if he remained contumacious he was to be left simply alone to his own devices. The community over which Titus presided in the place of Paul no longer were to know the obstinate heretic as a brother.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/titus/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;...">Titus 3:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">A man that is a heretic </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">αιρετικον</span>, <span class="ital">a party </span>or <span class="ital">schism-maker, </span>namely, in the church, among the true, genuine people of God; or one that causes divisions among those that are united in Christian fellowship; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-17.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them.">Romans 16:17</a>; <span class="ital">after the first and second admonition </span>— From thee and the elders of the church, given with proper solemnity; <span class="ital">reject </span>— Avoid, and declare him unfit to be any longer looked upon as a member of your community. “This is the only place in the whole Scripture where this word <span class="ital">heretic </span>occurs; and here it evidently means a man that obstinately persists in contending about foolish questions, and thereby occasions strifes and animosities, schisms and parties, among the faithful. This, and this alone, is a heretic in the Scripture sense. And his punishment likewise is here fixed. <span class="ital">Shun, </span>avoid, leave him to himself, have no fellowship with him. As for the Popish sense of the word, ‘A man that errs in fundamentals,’ although it crept, with many other things, early into the church, yet it has no shadow of foundation either in the Old or New Testament.” — Wesley. <span class="ital">Knowing that such </span>a one — Who is so fond of his own darling notions, that he will ruin the peace of the church: and will not submit to thy remonstrances, and those of the wiser and better part of the society; <span class="ital">is subverted </span>— Or <span class="ital">perverted, </span>as <span class="greekheb">εξεστραπται </span>maybe properly rendered; <span class="ital">and sinneth </span>— In making such obstinate efforts to diffuse his notions, and form a party to himself; <span class="ital">being condemned of himself </span>— Convinced in his own conscience that he acts wrong, as he cannot but see it to be evil to cause strife, animosity, contention, and disunion among those that fear God, and were, before he thus troubled them, united in Christian love. “In the first age, when the doctrines of the gospel were delivered by the apostles in person, under the guidance of inspiration, and when the true meaning of the doctrines was not liable to any doubt, because it was ascertained by the apostles themselves, if any teacher taught differently from them, and made a party in the church in opposition to them, he must have done these things contrary to his conscience, either from the love of money, or the lust of power, or from an immoderate propensity to sensual pleasures.” — Macknight; who observes further, “This method of treating heretics is worthy of attention; for the Spirit of God doth not order heretics to be banished, and their goods confiscated; far less doth he order them to be imprisoned, tortured, and burned, if they will not retract their errors. He doth not even give allowance to rail at or speak evil of them. Such methods of treating heretics never proceeded from the college of the apostles, but from the synagogue of Satan. To disown a wicked man as a Christian brother, and to avoid all familiar society with him, and to cast him out of the church by a public sentence of excommunication, is what the church and every society hath a right to do, agreeably to our Lord’s rule, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-17.htm" title="And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to you as an heathen man and a publican.">Matthew 18:17</a>,) and is all that should be done in such a case.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-11 When the grace of God towards mankind has been declared, the necessity of good works is pressed. Those who believe in God, must make it their care to maintain good works, to seek opportunities for doing them, being influenced by love and gratitude. Trifling, foolish questions must be avoided, and subtle distinctions and vain inquiries; nor should people be eager after novelties, but love sound doctrine which tends most to edifying. Though we may now think some sins light and little, if the Lord awaken the conscience, we shall feel even the smallest sin heavy upon our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/titus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man that is an heretic - The word "heretic" is now commonly applied to one who holds some fundamental error of doctrine, "a person who holds and teaches opinions repugnant to the established faith, or that which is made the standard of orthodoxy." Webster. The Greek word here used &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  hairetikos occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The corresponding noun (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  hairesis) occurs in the following places: <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>, where it is rendered "sect;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-14.htm">Acts 25:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, where it is rendered "heresy," and "heresies;" see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>. The true notion of the word is that of one who is a promoter of a sect or party. The man who makes divisions in a church, instead of aiming to promote unity, is the one who is intended. Such a man may form sects and parties on some points of doctrine on which be differs from others, or on some custom, religious rite, or special practice; he may make some unimportant matter a ground of distinction from his brethren, and may refuse to have fellowship with them, and endeavor to get up a new organization. Such a man, according to the Scripture usage, is a heretic, and not merely one who holds a different doctrine from that which is regarded as orthodoxy. The spirit of the doctrine here is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>, and the same class of persons is referred to. "Mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have received; and avoid them." See the notes at that passage. The word here used is defined by Robinson (Lexicon), "one who creates dissensions, introduces errors, a factious person." It is not found in classic Greek, but often in ecclesiastical writers; see Suicer's Thesaurus.<p>After the first and second admonition - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>. That is, do not do it hastily and rashly. Give him an opportunity to explain himself, and to repent and abandon his course. No man is to be cut off without giving him a proper opportunity to vindicate his conduct, and to repent if he has done wrong. If after the first and second admonition a man who is undoubtedly doing wrong, will not repent, then he is to be cut off. The apostle does not say in what way this admonition is to be given, or whether it should be public or private. The language which he uses would justify either, and the method which is to be adopted is doubtless to be determined by circumstances. The thing which is to be reached is, that his fault is to be fairly set before his mind.<p>Reject - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  paraitou. This word is rendered "excuse" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-18.htm">Luke 14:18-19</a>; "refuse," <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-11.htm">1 Timothy 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>; "avoid," <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-23.htm">2 Timothy 2:23</a>, and "entreated," <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-19.htm">Hebrews 12:19</a>. Its prevailing meaning, as used in connections like the one before us, is to reject in relation to an office; that is, to decline appointing one to an office. It probably had a primary reference to that here, and meant that a man who was given to making dissensions, or who was a factious person, should not be admitted to an office in the church. The general direction would also include this, - that he should not be admitted to the church. He is neither to be owned as a member, nor admitted to office; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-17.htm">Matthew 18:17</a>. "Let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican." In regard to this passage, then, we may observe:<p>(1) That the utmost limit which this allows is mere exclusion. It does not allow us to follow the offender with injury.<p>(2) it does not authorize us to oppose one on account of his mere private opinions. The essential idea is that of a factious, division-making man; a man who aims to form sects and parties, whether on account of opinions, or from any other cause.<p>(3) it does not make it right to deliver such a man over to the "secular arm," or to harm him in body, soul, property, or reputation. It gives no power to torture him on the rack, or with thumb-screws, or to bind him to the stake. It authorizes us not to recognize him as a Christian brother, or to admit him to an office in the church - but beyond this it gives us no right to go. He has a right to his own opinion still, as far as we are concerned, and we are not to molest him in the enjoyment of that right.<p>(4) it demands that, when a man is undoubtedly a heretic in the sense here explained, there should be the utmost kindness towards him, in order if possible to reclaim him. We should not begin by attacking and denouncing his opinions; or by formally arraigning him; or by blazoning his name as a heretic; but he is to be dealt with in all Christian kindness and brotherly fidelity. He is to be admonished more than once by those who have the right to admonish him; and then, and then only, if he does not repent, he is to be simply avoided. That is to be an end of the matter so far as we are concerned. The power of the church there ceases. It has no power to deliver him over to anyone else for persecution or punishment, or in any way to meddle with him. He may live where he pleases; pursue his own plans; entertain his own opinions or company, provided he does not interfere with us; and though we have a right to examine the opinions which he may entertain, yet our work with him is done. If these plain principles had been observed, what scenes of bloody and cruel persecution in the church would have been avoided! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/titus/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. heretic&#8212;Greek "heresy," originally meant a division resulting from individual self-will; the individual doing and teaching what he chose, independent of the teaching and practice of the Church. In course of time it came to mean definitely "heresy" in the modern sense; and in the later Epistles it has almost assumed this meaning. The heretics of Crete, when Titus was there, were in doctrine followers of their own self-willed "questions" reprobated in Tit 3:9, and immoral in practice.<p>reject&#8212;decline, avoid; not formal excommunication, but, "have nothing more to do with him," either in admonition or intercourse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/titus/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A man that is an heretic:</span> two things make up a heretic according to the common acceptation of the term now: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

An heretic, according to the notation of the word, is either one that makes choice of an opinion upon his own judgment, contrary to the generally received sense of the churches of Christ, and prefers it to theirs, and obstinately persists in it; separates from them, forms a party, and sets himself at the head of them, whom he has drawn into the same way of thinking with himself: or he is one that removes and takes away a fundamental doctrine of Christianity, which affects particularly the doctrine of the Trinity, the deity, and personality of Father, Son, and Spirit, and especially the doctrines relating to the person, office, and grace of Christ; one that brings in, or receives damnable doctrines; speaks or professes perverse things, and draws away disciples after him; or is among such disciples: for though schism and heresy do differ, and every schismatic may not be an heretic, yet every heretic is a schismatic; he makes a rent in the doctrine of Christ, and makes parties and divisions in his church; and such are not always to be contended and disputed with, but to be avoided and rejected: <p>after the first and second admonition reject; have nothing to do with him; have no society with him; admit him not to private conversation; and eject him from church communion, after he has been publicly admonished twice by the order of the church; for this is not to be understood of private admonition, by a particular person or persons; as in the case of private offences, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a> but of public admonition, in the name of the church.

The permission of a second attempt at reconciliation is probably not unconnected with our Lord’s counsel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">παραιτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">Have nothing to do with him</span>. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm" title="But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself rather to godliness.">1 Timothy 4:7</a>. The word does not necessarily imply any formal excommunication. Such procedure would be unnecessary. Excommunication has no terrors for those who deliberately separate themselves. “Monere desine. quid enim iuvat? laterem lavares” (Bengel).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/titus/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. This and the next verse seem to close the last instruction; St Paul reviews the counsel given as to doctrine and discipline; similarly at the close of 1 Tim. See summary at beginning of ch. vi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">A man</span> that is <span class="ital">a heretick</span>] This being so, it would be unnatural if the epithet here were required to have the definite narrowed meaning which we now give to the word ‘heretic’. The <span class="ital">internal</span> consideration favours a meaning which covers quarrelsome opinionative controversy and speculation, contentiousness in faith <span class="ital">and</span> morals. The <span class="ital">external</span> consideration is from St Paul’s usage of the word and its substantive. Prof. Reynolds misrepresents Bp Ellicott as saying ‘St Paul uses the word for contentious conduct, not heterodox opinions: divisions, not doctrinal error.’ His words are, ‘the word does not imply specially the open espousal of any <span class="ital">fundamental</span> error in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it....">1 Corinthians 11:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>; but more generally, “divisions in church matters,” possibly of a somewhat maturer kind.’ In that early day the ‘self chosen divergence,’ which is the essence of the word, included <span class="ital">both</span> religious belief and practice. Theod. Mops. Lat. Comm. defines ‘<span class="ital">haereticum</span>—illum qui ea quae contraria sunt pietatis praeelegit.’ And Augustine’s definition was exact, ‘haeresis schisma inveteratum.’ it was not till later that Jerome’s distinction held good, ‘haeresis perversum dogma habet; schisma propter Episcopalem dissensionem ab ecclesia separatur.’ This distinction as to <span class="ital">doctrine</span> and <span class="ital">discipline</span> found illustration in the Council of Nicæa, Arius being condemned as a heretic for maintaining that Christ was a Divine being but created, Meletius as a schismatic for ordaining bishops without the authority of his metropolitan or consent of his fellow bishops in the province of Egypt. Here the R.V. by its rendering <span class="bld">heretical</span> and its marginal ‘factious’ adopts this more general meaning for the word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after the first and second admonition, reject</span>] <span class="bld">A first and second admonition</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm" title="And, you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.">Ephesians 6:4</a>, ‘nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.’ ‘Discipline’ or ‘chastening’ (see the verb ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm" title="For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,">Titus 2:11</a>) is <span class="ital">per poenas</span>, ‘admonition’ is <span class="ital">verbis</span>, encouraging or reproving words according to the occasion. Here the reference must be to <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm" title="This witness is true. Why rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;">Titus 1:13</a>, the reproof of confutation and condemnation. ‘Reject’ should be rather <span class="bld">refuse</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm" title="But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself rather to godliness.">1 Timothy 4:7</a> where see note; and (of the widows) <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-11.htm" title="But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;">1 Timothy 5:11</a>; refuse, that is, to argue with, or to countenance. St Paul’s use is against the interpretation which has classical support, ‘exclude’ from Church membership, as in Lucian of divorcing a wife. But his use is <span class="ital">for</span> a stronger meaning than ‘avoid.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/titus/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Αἱρετικὸν</span>, <span class="ital">a heretic</span>) one following, according to his own will, the things which are found fault with at <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-9.htm" title="But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.">Titus 3:9</a>.—<span class="greekheb">παραιτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">reject</span>) cease to admonish him, for of what advantage is it?

The <span class="accented">heretic</span> is one who forsakes the truth held by the Church, and <span class="accented">chooses</span> some doctrine of his own devising (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). The tendency of such departures from the doctrine of the Church to assume more and more of a deadly character, and to depart wider and wider from the truth, gave to the name of heretic a darker shade of condemnation in the mouth of Church writers as time advanced. But even in apostolic times some denied the resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>); others denied the Lord that bought them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>); and there were some who were of the synagogue of Satan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a>); so that already an heretical man, drawing away disciples after him, was a great blot in the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Admonition</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">After a first and second admonition refuse</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-11.htm">1 Timothy 5:11</a>.
