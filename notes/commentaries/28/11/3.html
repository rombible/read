All who are grown up, ought often to reflect upon the goodness of God to them in their childhood. He took care of them, took pains with them, not only as a father, or a tutor, but as a mother, or nurse. When they were in the wilderness, God showed them the way in which they should go, and bore them up, taking them by the arms. He taught them the way of his commandments by the ceremonial law given by Moses. He took them by the arms, to guide them, that they might not stray, and to hold them up, that they might not stumble and fall. God's spiritual Israel are all thus supported. It is God's work to draw poor souls to himself; and none can come to him except he draw them. With bands of love; this word signifies stronger cords than the former. He eased them of the burdens they had long groaned under. Israel is very ungrateful to God. God's counsels would have saved them, but their own counsels ruined them. They backslide; there is no hold of them, no stedfastness in them. They backslide from me, from God, the chief good. They are bent to backslide; they are ready to sin; they are forward to close with every temptation. Their hearts are fully set in them to do evil. Those only are truly happy, whom the Lord teaches by his Spirit, upholds by his power, and causes to walk in his ways. By his grace he takes away the love and dominion of sin, and creates a desire for the blessed feast of the gospel, that they may feed thereon, and live for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I taught Ephraim also to go - Literally, "and I set Ephraim on his feet;" i. e., while they were rebelling, I was helping and supporting them, as a nurse doth her child, teaching it to go with little steps, step by step, "accustoming it to go by little and little without weariness;" and not only so, but "taking them by their arms;" or it may be equally translated, "He took them in His arms," i. e., God not only gently "taught" them "to walk," but when they were wearied, "He took them up in His arms," as a nurse doth a child when tired with its little attempts to walk. Such was the love and tender care of God, guiding and upholding Israel in His ways which He taught him, guarding him from weariness, or, if wearied, taking him in the arms of His mercy and refreshing him. So Moses says, "In the wilderness thou hast seen, how that the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>; and he expostulates with God, "Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that Thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth his sucking child, unto the land which Thou swarest unto their father's?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>. : "Briefly yet magnificently doth this place hint at the wondrous patience of God, whereof Paul too speaks, "for forty years suffered He their manner's in the wilderness" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-18.htm">Acts 13:18</a>.<p>For as a nursing father beareth patiently with a child, who hath not yet come to years of discretion, and, although at times he be moved to strike it in return, yet mostly he sootheth its childish follies with blandishments, and, ungrateful though it be, carries it in his arms, so the Lord God, whose are these words, patiently bore with the unformed people, ignorant of the spiritual mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, and although He killed the bodies of many of them in the wilderness yet the rest He soothed with many and great miracles, "leading them about, and instructing them, (as Moses says) keeping them as the apple of His eye" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>.<p>But they knew not that I healed them - They laid it not to heart, and therefore what they knew with their understanding was worse than ignorance. : "I who was a Father, became a nurse, and Myself carried My little one in My arms, that he should not be hurt in the wilderness, or scared by heat or darkness. By day I was a cloud; by night, a column of fire, that I might by My light illumine, and heal those whom I had protected. And when they had sinned and had made the calf, I gave them place for repentance, and they knew not that I healed them, so as, for forty years, to close the wound of idolatry, restore them to their former health."<p>: "The Son of God carried us in His arms to the Father, when He went forth carrying His Cross, and on the wood of the Cross stretched out His arms for our redemption. Those too doth Christ carry daily in His arms, whom He continually entreateth, comforteth, preserveth, so gently, that with much alacrity and without any grievous hindrance they perform every work of God, and with heart enlarged run, rather than walk, the way of God's commandments. Yet do these need great caution, that they be clothed with great circumspection and humility, and despise not others.

All the tribes of Israel and Ephraim, or the ten tribes with the rest; these the Lord instructed in the way of his commandments, and taught them to walk therein; he his angel before them, to conduct them through the wilderness; yea, he himself went before them in the pillar of cloud by day, and in the pillar of fire by night, to which history this seems to refer. So the Targum, <p>"I, by an angel sent by me, led Israel in the right way.'' <p>The allusion seems to be to a mother or nurse accommodating herself to her child, beginning to go; she stoops down, sets it on its feet, and one foot before another, forms its steps, teaches it how to go, and walks its pace with it. And in like manner the Lord deals with his spiritual Israel, his regenerated ones, who become like little children, and are used as such; as in regeneration they are quickened, and have some degree of spiritual strength given them, they are taught to go; they are taught what a Saviour Christ is, and their need of him; they are instructed to go to him by faith for everything they want, and to walk by faith on him, as they have received him; and having heard and learned of the Father, they go to Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>; and are taught also to go to the throne of grace for all supplies of grace; and to the house of God, to attend the word and ordinances, for the benefit of their souls; and to walk in the ways of the Lord, for his glory, and their good; <p>taking them by their arms; or "on his own arms" (x); bearing and carrying them in his arms, as a father his son; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>; so the Lord deals with his spiritual Israel, either holding them by their arms while walking, as nurses their children, to help and ease them in walking, and that they may not stumble and fall; so the Lord holds up the goings of his people in his ways, that their footsteps slip not, and upholds them with the right hand of his righteousness: or taking them up in his own arms when weary, he carries them in his bosom; or, when they are failing or fallen, lays hold on them, and takes them up again; and so they are not utterly cast down, whether the fall is into sin, or into some calamity and affliction; when he puts underneath his everlasting arms, and bears them and keeps them from sinking, as well as from a final and total falling away. Abarbinel, and others after him, interpret this of Ephraim taking up and carrying in his arms Baalim, the graven images and golden calves; which is mentioned as an instance of ingratitude; but very wrongly; <p>but they knew not that I healed them; of the diseases of Egypt, or preserved them from them: this includes the whole of their salvation and deliverance from Egypt, and all the benefits and favours accompanying it, which they imputed to their idols, and not to the Lord; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>. "Healing", in a spiritual sense, generally signifies the forgiveness of sin, which the Lord's people may have, and not know it; and, through want of better light and knowledge, may also ascribe it to their repentance, humiliation, and tears, when it is alone owing to the grace of God, and blood of Christ. <p>(x)  "super brachiis suis", Montanus; "super brachia sua", Piscator; "in brachis sua", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">I taught Ephraim also to go</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">Whereas I taught Ephraim to go.</span> A figure for the special providence watching over Ephraim.

It is that of an affectionate parent or tender nurse teaching a child to walk by leading-strings; taking it up in the arms when stumbling or making a false step; and in case it fell curing the wound. Thus, nurse-like, God taught Ephraim, his wayward perverse child, to use his feet (so the original word imports), all the while lending considerate help and seasonable aid. He took them by the hand to guide them, that they might not stray; he took them in his arms to hold them up, that they might not stumble and to help them over any obstacle that might lie in the way; and when, left to themselves during a short season, and in order to test their strength, they did stumble and fall, he healed their hurt. And yet they did not apprehend nor appreciate God's gracious design and dealings with them in thus guiding and guarding them, and in healing their diseases both temporal and spiritual. There is, perhaps, an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee." This promise, it will be remembered, was vouchsafed immediately after the bitter waters of Marah had been sweetened by the tree which, according to Divine direction, had been cast therein. Thus Kimchi: "<span class="accented">And</span> they have not acknowledged that I healed them of every sickness and every affliction, as he said, 'I will put none of these diseases upon thee.'" The reference is rather to all those evidences of his love which God manifested to them during their forty years' wandering in the wilderness; or perhaps to his guidance of them by 'his Law throughout their entire history. Rashi remarks that "they knew it very well, but dissembled [literally, 'trod it down with the heel,' equivalent to 'despised'] and acted, as if they did not know." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is properly taken both by Kimchi and Gesenius <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>; the former says; "The <span class="accented">tar</span> stands in place of <span class="accented">he:</span> this is the opinion of the grammarians;" the latter regards it as a solitary example of Tiphel; others again consider it a corrupt reading instead of the ordinary form of Hiph. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some take it for a noun, as J. Kimchi, who says it is "a noun after the form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>, and although the word is Milel (while in <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> it is Milra), yet it is the same form;" thus the translation is, "As for me, my guidance was to Ephraim;" so Jerome, "I have been as a nurse to Ephraim;" likewise also Cyril. The former explanation is simpler and also otherwise preferable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint has the incorrect rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "I bound the feet of Ephraim," which Jerome explains, "I bound the feet of Ephraim that they might not fly further from me," though his own rendering is that given above. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span> has also occasioned some difficulty and consequent diversity of explanation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some explain it to be an infinitive construct equivalent to the Latin gerund indo, as elsewhere. Thus in the Authorized Version it is "taking them by their arms;' but the common form of the infinitive of this verb is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; besides, the suffixes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> are contradictory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Olshausen and Ewald read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> in the first person, the received text having, according to the latter, maintained its place only through <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>; but this is conjectural and wants manuscript authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Still worse is Abarbanel's interpretation, who understands the subject of the verb and the suffix of the noun as referring to Ephraim; thus: "He (Ephraim) took them (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the idols) on his arms." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The correct explanation, as we think, is that of Kimchi and Gesenius, who take the verb for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> by a not unusual aphaeris of the <span class="accented">lamed:</span> "He took them in his arms," the transition from the first to the third person being justified by the pictorially descriptive style of the passage. The following comment of Kimchi is worthy of attention: "The prophet only mentions Ephraim (instead of all Israel), because it was he that made the calves. He says, 'And how does Ephraim reward me for this that I bestowed on them so many benefits, and accustomed them to go on their feet, and did not burthen them with my commandments and my service?' And because he has compared Ephraim to a boy, he uses the word, 'I led them by strings.' Just as one leads a boy that he may accustom himself to go little by little without trouble, so I led them from station to station, when I brought them out of Egypt; I led them gradually without overexertion, the cloud going before them by day, and the pillar of fire by night." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After these disclosures regarding the time of the end, the angel of the Lord dismisses the highly-favoured prophet from his life's work with the comforting assurance that he shall stand in his own lot in the end of the days. &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509; &#1500;&#1498; evidently does not mean "go to the end, i.e., go thy way" (Hitzig), nor "go hence in relation to the end," as Kranichfeld translates it, because &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509; with the article points back to &#1511;&#1509; &#1506;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-9.htm">Daniel 12:9</a>.
