But shameful sins shall have shameful punishments. Let them remember, not only what a mighty prince Jacob was with God, but what a servant he was to Laban. The benefits we have had from the word of God, make our sin and folly the worse, if we put any slight upon that word. We had better follow the hardest labour in poverty, than grow rich by sin. We may form a judgment of our own conduct, by comparing it with that of ancient believers in the like circumstances. Whoever despises the message of God, will perish.

"Wherefore He shall leave" (or, "cast") "his blood" (literally, "bloods") "upon him." The plural "bloods" expresses the manifoldness of the bloodshed . It is not used in Holy Scripture of mere guilt. Ephraim had shed blood profusely, so that it ran like water in the land (see the notes above at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-2.htm">Hosea 5:2</a>). He had sinned with a high hand against God, in destroying man made in the image of God. Amid that bloodshed, had been the blood not of the innocent only, but of those whom God sent to rebuke them for their idolatry, their rapine, their bloodshed. "Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>, as far as in her lay, with a complete excision. Ephraim thought his sins past; they were out of his sight; he thought that they were out of God's also; but they were laid up with God; and God, the prophet says, would cast them down upon him, so that they would crush him.<p>And his reproach shall his Lord return unto him - For the blood which he had shed, should his own blood be shed, for the reproaches which he had in divers ways cast against God or brought upon Him, he should inherit reproach. Those who rebel against God, bring reproach on Him by their sins, reproach Him by their excuses for their sins reproach Him in those whom He sends to recall them from their sins, reproach Him for chastening them for their sins. All who sin against the knowledge of God, bring reproach upon Him by acting sinfully against that knowledge. So Nathan says to David, "Thou hast given much occasion to the enemies of God to blaspheme" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>. The reproachful words of the enemies of God are but the echo of the opprobrious deeds of His unfaithful servants. The reproach is therefore, in an special manner, "their reproach" who caused it. All Israel's idolatries had this aggravation.<p>Their worship of the calves or of Baal or of any other gods of the nations, was a triumph of the false gods over God. Then, all sin must find some plea for itself, by impugning the wisdom or goodness of God who forbad it. Jeroboam, and Ephraim by adhering to Jeroboam's sin reproached God, as though the going up to Jerusalem was a hard service. "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." : "It was an open injury and reproach to God, to attribute to dead lifeless things those great and wonderful things done by Him for them." All the reproach, which they, in these ways, brought, or cast upon God, he says, "his Lord shall return" or "restore" to them. Their's it was; He would give it back to them, as He says, "Them that honor Me, I will honor; and they that despise Me, shall be lightly esteemed" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>.<p>Truly shame and reproach have been for centuries the portion of God's unfaithful people. To those who are lost, He gives back their reproach, in that they "rise to reproaches <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and everlasting abhorrence . It is an aggravation of this misery, that He who shall "give back to him" his reproach, had been "his God." Since "his God" was against him, who could be for him? "For whither should we go for refuge, save to Him? If we find wrath with Him, with whom should we find ruth?" Ephraim did not, the sinner will not, allow God to be "his God" in worship and service and love: but whether he willed or no, God would remain his Lord. He was, and might still have been their Lord for good; they would not have Him so, and so they should find Him still their Lord, as an Avenger, returning their own evil to them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. provoked him&#8212;that is, God.<p>leave his blood upon him&#8212;not take away the guilt and penalty of the innocent blood shed by Ephraim in general, and to Molech in particular.<p>his reproach shall his Lord return unto him&#8212;Ephraim's dishonor to God in worshipping idols, God will repay to him. That God is "his Lord" by right redemption and special revelation to Ephraim only aggravates his guilt, instead of giving him hope of escape. God does not give up His claim to them as His, however they set aside His dominion.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hosea/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly:</span> after all the means used from time to time to reclaim idolatrous sinning Israel, yet still they provoked God to indignation by their idolatries, perjuries, oppressions, murders, and all manner of sins which use to be rife among idolaters; these things were bitterness unto God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore, </span> seeing he will incorrigibly persist as he hath begun, and end in sin and misery, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall he leave his blood upon him; </span> he shall bear the guilt and punishment of all his blood, his murders of the innocent, of those that testified against him, and, as one who hath murdered himself, shall bear his own guilt too. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His reproach, </span> which Ephraim hath east upon the prophets and pious worshippers of God, all the reproach Ephraim hath cast on God, preferring idols before him, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall his Lord return unto him; </span> either God, who is Lord of all, or the Assyrian king and his princes, lording it over captive Ephraim; God shall by these return the shame on Ephraim which he cast on God, his worship, temple, and prophets. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hosea/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly,.... The Vulgate Latin version supplies it, me; that is, God, as Kimchi; or his Lord, as it may be supplied from the last clause of the verse; the sense is the same either way: it was God that Ephraim or the ten tribes provoked to stir up his wrath and vengeance against them; notwithstanding all the favours that they and their ancestors had received from him, they provoked him in a most bitter manner, to bitter anger, vehement wrath and fury: or, "with bitternesses" (n); with their sins, which are in their own nature bitter, displeasing to God; and in their effects bring bitterness and death on those that commit them; meaning particularly their idolatry, and all belonging to it; their idols, high places, altars, &amp;c. The word here used is rendered "high heaps" (o), <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-21.htm">Jeremiah 31:21</a>; and is here by Kimchi interpreted of altars, with which, and their sacrifices on them, they provoked the Lord to anger: <p>therefore shall he leave his blood upon him; the blood of innocent persons, prophets, and other good men shed by him; the sin of it shall be charged upon him, and he shall bear the punishment of it. So the Targum, <p>"the fault of innocent blood which he shed shall return upon him:'' <p>or "his own blood shall be poured out upon him" (p); in just retaliation for the blood of others shed by him, and for all the blood sired by him in idolatrous sacrifices, and other bloody sins; or his own blood being shed by the enemy shall remain upon him unrevenged; God will not punish those that shed it: <p>and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him: that is, as he has reproached the prophets of the Lord for reproving him for his idolatry, and reproached fire Lord himself, by revolting from him, and neglecting his worship, and preferring the worship of idols to him; so, as a just recompence, he shall be delivered up into the hands of the enemy, and become a reproach, a taunt, and a proverb, in all places into which he shall be brought. God is called "his Lord", though he had rebelled against him, and shook off his yoke, and would not obey him; yet, whether he will or not, he is his Lord, and will show himself to be so by his sovereignty and authority over him, and by the judgments exercised on him. Some understand this of the Assyrian king, become his lord, by taking and carrying him captive, the instrument in God's hand of bringing him to reproach; but the former sense seems best. <p>(n) "amaritudinibus", Pagninus, Vatablus, Piscator, Schmidt.

"And I lay waste her vine and her fig-tree, of which she said, They are lovers' wages to me, which my lovers gave me; and I make them a forest, and the beasts of the field devour them." Vine and fig-tree, the choicest productions of the land of Canaan, are mentioned as the representatives of the rich means of sustenance with which the Lord had blessed His people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-22.htm">Joel 2:22</a>, etc.).

Ewald, 163, h), signifies the wages of prostitution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>). The derivation is disputed and uncertain, since the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; cannot be shown to have been used either in Hebrew or the other Semitic dialects in the sense of dedit, dona porrexit (Ges.), and the word cannot be traced to &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503;, to extend; whilst, on the other hand, the &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9-10</a>) is most probably a denominative of &#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;.
