They carried on trade upon Canaanitish principles, covetously and with fraud and deceit. Thus they became rich, and falsely supposed that Providence favoured them. But shameful sins shall have shameful punishments. Let them remember, not only what a mighty prince Jacob was with God, but what a servant he was to Laban. The benefits we have had from the word of God, make our sin and folly the worse, if we put any slight upon that word. We had better follow the hardest labour in poverty, than grow rich by sin. We may form a judgment of our own conduct, by comparing it with that of ancient believers in the like circumstances. Whoever despises the message of God, will perish.

As if he said, "the only result of all this, with which the prophets charge me, is that 'I am become rich:' and since God thus prospers me, it is a sure proof that he is not displeased with me, that 'no iniquity' can be 'found in me;'" the ordinary practical argument of men, as long as God withholds His punishments, that their ways cannot be so displeasing to Him. With the people of this world, with its politicians, in trade, it is the one decisive argument: "I was in the right, for I succeeded." "It was a good speculation, for he gained thousands." "it was good policy, for, see its fruits. An answer, at which the pagan laughed, "the people hisses me, but I, I, safe at home, applaud myself, when the coin jingles in my chest" . The pagan ridiculed it; Christians enact it. But in truth, the fact that God does not punish, is often the evidence of His extremest displeasure.<p>They shall find none iniquity in me, that were sin - The merchants of Ephraim continue their protest; "in all the toil of my hands, all my buying and selling, my bargains, contracts, they can bring no iniquity home to me," and then, in a tone of simple innocence, they add, 'that' were 'sin,' as though they 'could' not do, what to do were sin. None suspect themselves less, than those intent on gain. The evil customs of other traders, the habits of trade, the seeming necessity for some frauds, the conventional nature of others, the minuteness of others, with their frequent repetition, blind the soul, until it sees no sin, while, with every smallest sale, "they sell their own souls into the bargain" . <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. And&#8212;that is, Notwithstanding.<p>Yet I am &#8230; rich&#8212;I regard not what the prophets say: I am content with my state, as I am rich (Re 3:17). Therefore, in just retribution, this is the very language of the enemy in being the instrument of Israel's punishment. Zec 11:5: "They that sell them say &#8230; I am rich."

Ephraim argues, My success in my labors proves that I am not a guilty sinner as the prophets assert. Thus sinners pervert God's long-suffering goodness (Mt 5:45) into a justification of their impenitence (compare Ec 8:11-13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hosea/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ephraim said; </span> this covetous, oppressive merchant reckoned with himself, or discoursed with himself, upon the whole of his trading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yet I am become rich; </span> whatever is said by some, or thought by others, yet I get what I aim at: either it is good and lawful, and prospered to me by the blessing of God on it because it is just and righteous, or it is not so bad as morose prophets and preachers make it, or at worst (which I will venture, saith Ephraim) it lessens my innocency, but improves my stock, and this is more to such merchants than all the poor innocence in the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I have found me out substance; </span> the same thing, with a vain boast of what is not in his wealth and substance.

Notwithstanding they took such unjust methods, as to use deceitful balances, they prospered in the world, got abundance of riches; and therefore concluded from thence that their manner of dealing was not criminal, at least not so bad as the prophets represented to them; and so promised themselves impunity, and that what they were threatened with would not come upon them; and, as long as they got riches, they cared not in what manner; and inasmuch as they prospered and succeeded in their course of trading, they were encouraged to go on, and not fear any evil coming upon them for it. According to Aben Ezra and Kimchi, the sense is, that they became rich of themselves, by their own industry and labour, and did not acknowledge that their riches, and power to get them, were of God. They gloried in them as their own attainments; and which they had little reason to do, since they were treasures of wickedness, and mammon of unrighteousness, which in a day of wrath would be of no service to them; <p>I have found me out substance; they found ways and means of acquiring great riches, and large estates, by their own wisdom and cunning, and all for themselves, for their own use, to be enjoyed by them for years to come; and they were reckoned by them solid and substantial things, when a mere shadow, emptiness, and vanity; and were not to be employed for their own use and advantage only, but should have been for the good of others; nor were they to be attributed to their own sagacity, prudence, and management, but to the providence of God, admitting they had been got in ever so honourable and just a manner; <p>in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin: here again Ephraim, or the people of Israel, vainly ascribe all their wealth and riches to their own labour, diligence, and industry, and take no notice of God and his providence, or of his blessing upon them; and pretend to be very upright and honest in their dealings, and that what they got were very honestly got, and would bear the strictest scrutiny; and that if their course of trade was ever so narrowly looked into, there would be nothing found that was very bad or criminal, that they could be justly reproached the; only some little trifling things, that would not bear the name of "sin", or deserve any correction or punishment; so pure were they in their own eyes, so blinded and hardened in sin, and fearless of the divine displeasure; like the adulterous woman, wiped their mouths when they had eaten the sweet morsels of sin, and said they had done no wickedness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-20.htm">Proverbs 30:20</a>; or which was involuntary, and not done knowingly, as Kimchi and Abendana: or rather, as Ben Melech renders it, "no iniquity and sin"; and so others: or, best of all, "no iniquity or sin", as Noldius (a); no iniquity, or any kind of sin at all. Thus, as Ephraim was charged before with idolatry and lies in religion, so here with fraudulent dealings, and getting riches in an illicit way in civil things; and of whose repentance and reformation there was no hope. <p>(a) Concord.

Not Israel, but Canaan should he be called; for his ideal is Canaan’s. The end justifies the means, and his end is—to become rich! But how bitterly will he be disappointed. He must in short begin his history over again, and repeat his wilderness-wanderings. Or to speak more plainly, idolatry must be rooted out. Jehovah must take up the challenge thrown down by Ephraim. Just before the severe final rebuke, Hosea resumes his appeal to the instructive history of Jacob; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/12-12.htm" title="And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep....">Hosea 12:12-13</a> may be misplaced.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance.</span> Ephraim in this verse boasts of his riches, though procured by fraud and violence, while he maintains at the same time that he has not sinned thereby so as to expose himself to punishment or deserve severe reprehension. The particle - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>- has two principal meanings: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "surely" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "only." In the former sense the clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> may allude to the injunction contained in ver. 6 to wait on God, and may signify, "No doubt I have become rich, yet not through Divine help, but by my own exertions;" in the latter sense it may signify, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "I have only become rich; I have done nothing else; I have done nothing amiss" Aben Ezra regards <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> as introducing the apodosis, and explains it nearly in the sense of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (1)</span>, thus: "The sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5da;</span> is, 'God has not given me the wealth, <span class="accented">but</span> I by myself [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my own unaided efforts] have become rich, for I am not as the Canaanite,' that is, the merchant, as 'There shall be no more the Canaanite' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>) ;" he then proceeds to show the connection, "And the meaning [according to the context] is, 'Why does he say, Keep mercy and judgment, and be not an oppressor like the Canaanite [nor am I]? yet all is my own honest earning; none of the sons of men shall find that I have sinned.'" The interpretation of Kimchi is similar, but somewhat simpler, thus: "The words, 'I am become rich,' are the opposite of 'Wait on thy God continually.' But he (Ephraim) does not wait on God the blessed, and he does not acknowledge that he gave him strength to acquire wealth, but says, 'My own power and the strength of my hands have made for me this wealth,' and he forgetteth God the blessed, who gave him power to work, as it is written in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-14.htm">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>), 'And thou forget the Lord thy God.' This is what he (the prophet) means by 'I have become rich;' he means to say, 'I have become rich from myself,'" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by my own labor. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> denotes both physical or bodily strength, and also, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, riches, Latin <span class="accented">opes, prob</span>ably as procured thereby. The flourishing state of the kingdom during the reigns of Joash and Jeroboam II. may have induced their overweening self-confidence and their amazing forgetfulness of God, and at the same time this surprising ignorance of their real condition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Septuagint rendering is <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f55;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I have found refreshment for myself," and Jerome, "Inveni mihi idolum," as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;</span> had been read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">In all my labors they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin</span>; margin, <span class="accented">all my labors suffice me not:</span> he shall bare <span class="accented">punishment of iniquity in whom is sin</span>. Here two modes of construction are possible and each has had its advocates; thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the <span class="accented">subject</span> of the verb, as in the LXX., which is, "None of his labors shall be found available for him on account of the sins he has committed." This is the rendering followed and interpreted by Cyril and Theodoret. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The words in question, instead of being taken as the subject to the verb, may be employed <span class="accented">absolutely</span> or with the ellipsis of a preposition, as in the Authorized Version; thus: "As to my labors, or the fruits of my labors," for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>, is used in both senses. The meaning of the passage then is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, besides the sins of fraud and oppression, Ephraim did not shrink through shame to vindicate his conduct and to maintain that. in all the riches he had acquired with such labor, no one could show that those riches had been unjustly acquired by him, or that there was sin contracted in their acquisition. Thus Kimchi: "He (the prophet) mentions another vice, saying that he (Ephraim) oppresses, and asserts that, in all he has labored for and gathered together, they shall not be able to find <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> any riches of iniquity and sin. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> is the same as iniquity <span class="accented">and</span> sin, and thus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>) 'it is good and comely' (<span class="accented">asher</span> here also for <span class="accented">ray</span>). Or the explanation of it is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> They shall not find with me iniquity. nor any matter in which there is sin pertaining to me. And <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is less than <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;</span> iniquity, for sin comes sometimes by reason of error. Or the explanation of 'iniquity which were sin' is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Iniquity in which there was sin to me; as if he said, with regard to which I had sinned; for if riches came into my hand through iniquity and robbery, it was not with my knowledge; he means: so that I sinned in relation to it, and took it by iniquity with my knowledge; and in this way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-16.htm">Leviticus 22:16</a>) 'they lade themselves with the iniquity of trespass; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;</span> being in construct state, that is to say, iniquity with regard to which they trespassed." <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> signifies "belonging to me;" while <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d0;</span> is read, not as a noun, but as a verb in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Chaldee, which is explained by Rashi, gives an explanation identical, though only partially so, with the marginal rendering of the Authorized Version, namely, "It were good for thee if thou consideredst with thyself: all my riches do not suffice me, in order to expiate the iniquity which I have committed." This, and the marginal reading - both where they coincide and where they diverge - we must unhesitatingly reject as far-fetched, artificial, and having no real basis in the text. To their other sins Israel added this protestation of innocence, which was the solemn protestation of a falsehood. The clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> may admit another sense; thus: If in ray gains by labor iniquity should be found, that indeed would be sin; but such is not the case. Thus, like the Pharisees of a later age, did they justify themselves before men; but God knew their hollow-hearted hypocrisy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Therefore (because the woman says this), behold, thus will I hedge up thy way with thorns, and wall up a wall, and she shall not find her paths." The hedging up of the way, strengthened by the similar figure of the building of a wall to cut off the way, denotes her transportation into a situation in which she could no longer continue her adultery with the idols. The reference is to distress and tribulation (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-23.htm">Job 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7</a>), especially the distress and anguish of exile, in which, although Israel was in the midst of idolatrous nations, and therefore had even more outward opportunity to practise idolatry, it learned the worthlessness of all trust in idols, and their utter inability to help, and was thus impelled to reflect and turn to the Lord, who smites and heals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>).<p>This thought is carried out still further in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a> : "And she will pursue her lovers, and not overtake them; and seek them, and not find them: and will say, I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better with me then than now." Distress at first increases their zeal in idolatry, but it soon brings them to see that the idols afford no help. The failure to reach or find the lovers, who are sought with zeal (ridde&#772;ph, piel in an intensive sense, to pursue eagerly), denotes the failure to secure what is sought from them, viz., the anticipated deliverance from the calamity, which the living God has sent as a punishment. This sad experience awakens the desire to return to the faithful covenant God, and the acknowledgment that prosperity and all good things are to be found in vital fellowship with Him.<p>The thought that God will fill the idolatrous nation with disgust at its coquetry with strange gods, by taking away all its possessions, and thus putting to shame its delusive fancy that the possessions which it enjoyed really came from the idols, is still further expanded in the second strophe, commencing with the eighth verse. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>. "And she knows not that I have given her the corn, and the must, and the oil, and have multiplied silver to her, and gold, which they have used for Baal." Corn, must, and oil are specified with the definite article as being the fruits of the land, which Israel received from year to year. These possessions were the foundation of the nation's wealth, through which gold and silver were multiplied. Ignorance of the fact that Jehovah was the giver of these blessings, was a sin. That Jehovah had given the land to His people, was impressed upon the minds of the people for all time, together with the recollection of the mighty acts of the Lord, by the manner in which Israel had been put in possession of Canaan; and not only had Moses again and again reminded the Israelites most solemnly that it was He who gave rain to the land, and multiplied and blessed its fruitfulness and its fruits (compare, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14-15</a>), but this was also perpetually called to their remembrance by the law concerning the offering of the first-fruits at the feasts. The words &#8219;a&#770;su&#772; labba&#8219;al are to be taken as a relative clause without 'asher, though not in the sense of "which they have made into Baal," i.e., out of which they have made Baal-images (Chald., Rabb., Hitzig, Ewald, and others); for even though &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500; occurs in this sense in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-17.htm">Isaiah 44:17</a>, the article, which is wanting in Isaiah, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>, precludes such an explanation here, apart from the fact that habba&#8219;al cannot stand by itself for a statue of Baal. Here &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500; has rather the general meaning "apply to anything," just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>, where it occurs in a perfectly similar train of thought. This use of the word may be obtained from the meaning "to prepare for anything," whereas the meaning "to offer," which Gesenius adopts ("which they have offered to Baal"), is untenable, since &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; simply denotes the preparation of the sacrifice for the altar, which is out of the question in the case of silver and gold. They had applied their gold and silver to Baal, however, not merely by using them for the preparation of idols, but by employing them in the maintenance and extension of the worship of Baal, or even by regarding them as gifts of Baal, and thus confirming themselves in the zealous worship of that god. By habba'al we are not simply to understand the Canaanitish or Phoenician Baal in the stricter sense of the word, whose worship Jehu had exterminated from Israel, though not entirely, as is evident from the allusion to an Asherah in Samaria in the reign of Jehoahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-6.htm">2 Kings 13:6</a>); but Baal is a general expression for all idols, including the golden calves, which are called other gods in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-9.htm">1 Kings 14:9</a>, and compared to actual idols. </body></html>
