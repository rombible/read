Cease.—</span>The mirth is here indicative of the general character of the ceremonial—certainly not in itself a bad sign. David danced before the Lord, and justified the act. No one was to appear with sad countenance before Jehovah, any more than before an earthly potentate. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm" title="Why the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,">Nehemiah 2:2</a>.)<p>The “feast days” are to be distinguished from the “solemn feasts.” The latter term is more generic in Hebrew, while the former denoted the three great festivals of the year (especially the Feast of Tabernacles). These feasts, which Jeroboam I. had instituted, are not spoken of in themselves as sinful.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:6-13 God threatens what he would do with this treacherous, idolatrous people. They did not turn, therefore all this came upon them; and it is written for admonition to us. If lesser difficulties be got over, God will raise greater. The most resolute in sinful pursuits, are commonly most crossed in them. The way of God and duty is often hedged about with thorns, but we have reason to think it is a sinful way that is hedged up with thorns. Crosses and obstacles in an evil course are great blessings, and are to be so accounted; they are God's hedges, to keep us from transgressing, to make the way of sin difficult, and to keep us from it. We have reason to bless God for restraining grace, and for restraining providences; and even for sore pain, sickness, or calamity, if it keeps us from sin. The disappointments we meet with in seeking for satisfaction from the creature, should, if nothing else will do it, drive us to the Creator. When men forget, or consider not that their comforts come from God, he will often in mercy take them away, to bring them to think upon their folly and danger. Sin and mirth can never hold long together; but if men will not take away sin from their mirth, God will take away mirth from their sin. And if men destroy God's word and ordinances, it is just with him to destroy their vines and fig-trees. This shall be the ruin of their mirth. Taking away the solemn seasons and the sabbaths will not do it, they will readily part with them, and think it no loss; but He will take away their sensual pleasures. Days of sinful mirth must be visited with days of mourning.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will also cause her mirth to cease, her feast days ... - Israel had forsaken the temple of God; despised His priests; received from Jeroboam others whom God had not chosen; altered, at least, one of the festivals; celebrated all, where God had forbidden; and worshiped the Creator under the form of a brute creature (see Introduction). Yet they kept the great "feast-days," whereby they commemorated His mercies to their forefathers; the "new moons," whereby the first of every month was given to God; "the sabbaths," whereby they owned God as the Creator of all things; and all the other "solemn feasts," whereby they thanked God for acts of His special providence, or for His annual gifts of nature, and condemned themselves for trusting in false gods for those same gifts, and for associating His creatures with Himself. But man, even while he disobeys God, does not like to part with Him altogether, but would serve Him enough to soothe his own conscience, or as far as he can without parting with his sin which he loves better. Jeroboam retained all of God's worship, which he could combine with his own political ends; and even in Ahab's time Israel "halted between two opinions," and Judah "sware both by the Lord and by Malcham" <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, the true God and the false. All this their worship was vain, because contrary to the will of God. Yet since God says, "I will take away all her mirth," they had, what they supposed to be, religious "mirth" in their "feasts," fulfilling as they thought, the commandment of God, "Thou shalt rejoice in thy feasts" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>. She could have no real joy, since true joy is "in the Lord" <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>. So, in order that she might not deceive herself anymore, God says that he will take away that feigned formal service of Himself, which they blended with the real service of idols, and will remove the hollow outward joy, that, through repentance, they might come to the true joy in Him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. her feast days&#8212;of Jeroboam's appointment, distinct from the Mosaic (1Ki 12:32). However, most of the Mosaic feasts, "new-moons" and "sabbaths" to Jehovah, remained, but to degenerate Israel worship was a weariness; they cared only for the carnal indulgence on them (Am 8:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hosea/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will also cause all her mirth to cease; </span> the jollity of Israel was certainly damped when Tiglath-pileser took Ijon, and other cities, and captivated Naphtali, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2 Kings 15:29</a></span>, which was some, yet but few, years after this prophecy: but sure all their joy ceased about ten or twelve years after, when Samaria was taken, and Hoshea and all Israel made captives: so the threat was executed in this sense.

These expressions are remarkable, for Hosea is a prophet of northern Israel. It would appear, then, that the separation of north and south did not involve a discontinuance of the festivals in the north (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-5.htm" title="What will you do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?">Hosea 9:5</a>). Amos had already predicted the ruin of the ‘feasts’ in N. Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm" title="And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.">Amos 8:10</a>). In addition to the ‘feasts’ which are doubtless those mentioned in the earliest body of legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-14.htm" title="Three times you shall keep a feast to me in the year.">Exodus 23:14</a>, &c., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-18.htm" title="The feast of unleavened bread shall you keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.">Exodus 34:18</a>, &c.), Hosea specifies the new moon and the sabbath (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm" title="And he said, Why will you go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.">2 Kings 4:23</a>) as passing away together with the national independence. This was not strictly speaking the case with regard to the sabbath, which became one great bond of union among the Jews in exile. But the old, popular sabbath of unrestrained joy (comp. Hosea’s ‘all her mirth’) did pass away; the sabbath of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm" title="If you turn away your foot from the sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shall honor him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words:">Isaiah 58:13</a> was very different from that which was popularly observed in ancient Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and all her solemn feasts</span>] Or, <span class="bld">festal assemblies</span>. The term is more comprehensive than ‘feast’; the Levitical legislation recognizes seven ‘festal assemblies’, but only three ‘feasts’ (comp. Lev. 33).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</span> The enumeration is complete, "Her feast days" were the three annual festivals of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. "Her new moons" were the monthly celebrations at the commencement of each month. "Her sabbaths" were the weekly solemnities of one day in seven, dedicated to the Lord. Then there is a general summing up of the whole by the addition of "all her solemn feasts," - all her festal days and seasons, including, besides those named, the beginning of the years, the solemn assembly or holy convocation on the seventh day of the Passover and on the eighth day of Tabernacles. Preceding the enumeration is the general <span class="accented">characteristic</span> of all Israel's festivities. They were times of joy, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>, "In the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets;" and in Dent. 12:12 it is expressly declared, "Ye shall rejoice before the Lord... ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates." All this was to cease; the coming captivity would render all such celebrations impossible. Kimchi remarks on this (ver. 11): "For in the distress there is no new moon and no sabbath; and the beginnings of months and sabbaths on which offerings were presented were days of joy. And so with respect to the feast days and solemn assemblies, which were days of rest and quiet joy, they shall not have in them any joy in consequence of the greatness of their distresses." He subsequently adds, "There is a <span class="accented">chag</span> which is not a <span class="accented">raced</span>, but joy wherewith men rejoice and eat and drink; and it is called <span class="accented">chag</span>," referring to Solomon's feast of dedication; "and there is also a <span class="accented">moed</span> which is not a <span class="accented">chag</span>, as for signs and for seasons (<span class="accented">moedim</span>), and at the appointed time I will return unto thee" (<span class="accented">raced</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5e8;</span>, to appoint as time and place). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Daniel had for a while contemplated the conduct of the ram, he saw a he-goat come from the west over the earth, run with furious might against the two-horned ram, and throw it to the ground and tread upon it. The he-goat, according to the interpretation of the angel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, represents the king of Javan (Greece and Macedonia) - not the person of the king (Gesen.), but the kingship of Javan; for, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, the great horn of the goat symbolizes the first king, and thus the goat itself cannot represent a separate king. The goat comes from the west; for Macedonia lay to the west of Susa or Persia. Its coming over the earth is more definitely denoted by the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1504;&#1493;&#1490;&#1506; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, and he was not touching the earth, i.e., as he hastened over it in his flight. This remark corresponds with the four wings of the leopard, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a>. The goat had between its eyes &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1511;&#1512;&#1503;; i.e., not a horn of vision, a horn such as a goat naturally has, but here only in vision (Hofm., Klief.). This interpretation would render &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; an altogether useless addition, since the goat itself, only seen in vision, is described as it appeared in the vision. For the right explanation of the expression reference must be made to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>, where, instead of horn of vision, there is used the expression &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1503; (the great horn). Accordingly &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; has the meaning of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, in the Keri &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-21.htm">2 Samuel 23:21</a>, a man of countenance or sight (cf. Targ. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-2.htm">Esther 2:2</a>): a horn of sight, consideration, of considerable greatness; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; (lxx, Theodot.), which Theodoret explains by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;.<p>The horn was between the eyes, i.e., in the middle of the forehead, the centre of its whole strength, and represents, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, the first king, i.e., the founder of the Javanic world-kingdom, or the dynasty of this kingdom represented by him. The he-goat ran up against the ram, the possessor of the two horns, i.e., the two-horned ram by the river Ulai, in the fire of his anger, i.e., in the glowing anger which gave him his strength, and with the greatest fury threw him down. The prophet adds, "And I saw him come close unto the ram," as giving prominence to the chief matter, and then further describes its complete destruction. It broke in pieces both of the horns, which the ram still had, i.e., the power of the Medes and Persians, the two component elements of the Persian world-kingdom. This representation proves itself to be genuine prophecy, whilst an author writing ex eventu would have spoken of the horn representing the power of the Medes as assailed and overthrown earlier by that other horn (see under <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm">Daniel 7:20</a>). The pushing and trampling down by the Ulai is explained from the idea of the prophecy, according to which the power of the ram is destroyed at the central seat of its might, without reference to the historical course of the victories by which Alexander the Great completed the subjugation of the Persian monarchy. In the concluding passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-7.htm">Daniel 8:7</a>, the complete destruction is described in the words of the fourth verse, to express the idea of righteous retribution. As the Medo-Persian had crushed the other kingdoms, so now it also was itself destroyed. </body></html>
