The prophet foretels a plentiful increase of true believers, like to that of corn sown in the earth; and represents the converted Jews as being the seed from which an abundant harvest of Gentile converts should arise. “The myriads of the natural Israel,” says Bishop Horsley, “converted by the preaching of the apostles, were the first seed of the universal church. And there is reason to believe, that the restoration of the converted Jews will be the occasion and means of a prodigious influx of new converts from the Gentiles in the latter ages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm" title="For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?">Romans 11:15</a>.

By the promise of rest in Christ we are invited to take his yoke upon us; and the work of conversion may be forwarded by comforts as well as by convictions. But usually the Lord drives us to despair of earthly joy, and help from ourselves, that, being shut from every other door, we may knock at Mercy's gate. From that time Israel would be more truly attached to the Lord; no longer calling him Baali, or My lord and master, alluding to authority, rather than love, but Ishi, an address of affection. This may foretell the restoration from the Babylonish captivity; and also be applied to the conversion of the Jews to Christ, in the days of the apostles, and the future general conversion of that nation; and believers are enabled to expect infinitely more tenderness and kindness from their holy God, than a beloved wife can expect from the kindest husband. When the people were weaned from idols, and loved the Lord, no creature should do them any harm. This may be understood of the blessings and privileges of the spiritual Israel, of every true believer, and their partaking of Christ's righteousness; also, of the conversion of the Jews to Christ. Here is an argument for us to walk so that God may not be dishonoured by us: Thou art my people. If a man's family walk disorderly, it is a dishonour to the master. If God call us children, we may say, Thou art our God. Unbelieving soul, lay aside discouraging thoughts; do not thus answer God's loving-kindness. Doth God say, Thou art my people? Say, Lord, thou art our God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will sow her unto Me in the earth - She whom God sows, is the Church, of whom God speaks as her, because she is the Mother of the faithful. After the example of her Lord, and by virtue of His Death, every suffering is to increase her. "The blood of Christians was their harvest-seed" . "The Church was not diminished by persecutions, but increased and the field of the Lord was even clothed with the richer harvest, in that the seeds, which fell singly, arose multiplied" .<p>In the earth - "o  He does not say "in their own land," i. e., Judea, but "the earth." The whole earth was to be the seed-plot of the Church, where God would sow her to Himself, plant, establish, cause her to increase, and multiply her mightily." As he said, "Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the pagan for Thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for Thy possession" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>. Of this sowing, Jews were the instruments. Of them according to the flesh, Christ came; of them were the Apostles and Evangelists and all writers of Holy Scripture; of them was the Church first formed, into which the Gentiles were received, being, with them; knit into one in Christ.<p>I will ... have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy - This which was true of Israel in its dispersion, was much more true of the Gentiles. These too, the descendants of righteous Noah, God had cast off for the time, that they should be no more His people, when he chose Israel out of them, to make known to them His Being, and His will, and His laws, and, (although in shadow and in mystery,) Christ who was to come. So God's mercies again overflow His threatenings. He had threatened to Israel, that he should be "unpitied," and no more His people; in reversing His sentence, He embraces in the arms of His mercy all who were not His people, and says of them all, that they should be "My people and beloved." At one and the same time, was Israel to be thus multiplied, and "pity" was to be shown to those not pitied, and those who were "not God's people," were to become "His people." At one and the same time were those promises fulfilled in Christ; the one through the other; Israel was not multiplied by itself; but through the bringing in of the Gentiles. Nor was Israel alone, or chiefly, brought into a new relation with God. The same words promised the same mercy to both, Jew and Gentile, that all should be "one in Christ," all one Jezreel, one Spouse to Himself, one Israel of God, one Beloved; and that all, with one voice of jubilee. should cry unto Him, "my Lord and my God."<p>And they shall say, Thou art my God, - (or rather, shall say, my God) There seems to be more affectionateness in the brief answer, which sums up the whole relation of the creature to the Creator in that one word, "Elohai, my God." The prophet declares, as before, that, when God thus anew called them His people, they by His grace would obey His call, and surrender themselves wholly to Him. For to say, "my God," is to own an exelusive relation to God alone. It is to say, my beginning and my end, my hope and my salvation, my whole and only good, in whom Alone I will hope, whom alone I will fear, love, worship, trust in, obey and serve, with all my heart, mind, soul and strength; my God and my all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

That is, Jezreel, or the people of God, the church betrothed; this is another blessing following upon the marriage relation between Christ and his people, both Jews and Gentiles, in the latter day, a multiplication of a spiritual seed and offspring. So Kimchi and Aben Ezra observe, that the words signify that the people of Israel shall increase and be fruitful as the seed of the earth. These now are good seed which the Lord sows; such as are born not of corruptible but incorruptible seed; are quickened by the Spirit of God; have a good work of grace begun in them; and though they may lie for some time under the clods in darkness and obscurity, yet shall rise up in the green blade of a lively profession, and bring forth the fruits of righteousness. Seed for sowing is the choicest and most precious, and of greatest esteem and value, and is separated from the rest for that use, though but little and small in quantity in comparison of it; all which is applicable to the people of God. This is said to be sown "in the earth or land"; either in their own land, the land of Israel, into which they shall now be brought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-22.htm">Ezekiel 21:22</a> or in the field of the world, the nations and people of the earth, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-9.htm">Zechariah 10:9</a> or rather in the churches of Christ on earth, the churches in the Gentile world, into which the Jews, when converted, shall be brought, and increase and multiply; and this will be all the Lord's doing. <p>I will sow her: he will quicken and convert them, and place and plant them in Gospel churches, though ministers may be instruments in his hands; and all their fruitfulness and increase will be "unto him", for his service, the promotion of his interest, and for his honour and glory. The Targum is, <p>"I will establish you before me in the land of my Shechinah or majesty.'' <p>And I will have mercy on her that had not obtained mercy; upon Loruhamah, or the people of Israel, signified by her, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-6.htm">Hosea 1:6</a> and also the Gentiles, for to both Jews and Gentiles the apostle applies the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24</a> and they were fulfilled in part in his time, by the conversion of some of the Jews, and by the calling of the Gentiles; but will have a larger accomplishment in the latter day, when all Israel shall obtain mercy, and be saved; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a> and are applicable to the people of God at all times, when called by grace; for though before conversion there is mercy for them in the heart of God, which is from everlasting; and in his purpose and resolution to bestow; and which is displayed in his choice of them, considered in the decree of the means as fallen creatures, and so vessels of mercy; and which is laid up in covenant for them, which is full of the sure mercies of David; and appears in the mission of Christ, and their redemption by him; and in sparing and saving them before calling; as well as in their regeneration, which is the fruit of abundant mercy; yet is not manifested to them till converted, when they openly obtain it: the Lord has mercy on them, and brings them out of the horrible pit of the state of nature; plucks them as brands out of the burning; opens the prison doors, knocks off their fetters, and sets them free; feeds their hungry and clothes their naked souls; heals their diseases, and pardons their iniquities, and saves them with an everlasting salvation. <p>And I will say to them which were not my people, thou art my people; or to "Loammi", the people of Israel, signified by the prophet's child of that name, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a>, who should no more be called so, but "Ammi", my people, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>, which, as before observed, was in part fulfilled in the first times of the Gospel; but will be more fully accomplished at the conversion of the Jews, and the bringing in the fulness of the Gentiles; who though chosen to be the people of God, and are so federally, and were given in covenant to Christ as such, and so redeemed and saved by him from their sins; yet are not till conversion laid hold on by the Lord, and formed as his people for himself, and are without knowledge of him, and communion with him: nor are they called his people by themselves or others; but, when converted, they have the characters, and enjoy the privileges, of God's people; they have the witness of the relation to themselves by the Spirit of God, and are known and acknowledged by others; the Lord says this unto them, and avouches them for his people: <p>and they shall say, thou art my God; in the strength of faith, under the testimony of the Spirit of God, they shall claim their interest in God, as their covenant God in Christ; which is made known in effectual calling by the work of grace on their hearts; by the blessings of grace bestowed on them; and by the Lord's dwelling among them, and his protection of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">And I will sow her unto me in the earth</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">in the land.</span> Jehovah declares that Jezreel shall verify her name (<span class="ital">her</span> name, for Jezreel means restored Israel) by being sown anew in the promised land.

Thus one of the symbolic names of chap. 1 is not indeed changed, but transformed by interpretation.

A post-exile prophecy also contains an unmistakable allusion to this passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm" title="And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.">Zechariah 13:9</a>, end). Applications like these shew how great was the <span class="ital">posthumous</span> influence of the prophets.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The justice of this exposition is placed beyond a doubt by this verse. Here the angel says in distinct words, "I will show thee what will happen &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; (in the last time of the indignation), for it relates to the appointed time of the end." Kliefoth indeed thinks that what the angel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, says to the prophet for his comfort is not the same that he had said to him in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, and which cast him down, and that <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a> does not contain anything so weighty and so overwhelming as <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, but something more cheering and consoling; that it gives to the vision another aspect, which relieves Daniel of the sorrow which it had brought upon him on account of its import with reference to the end. From this view of the contents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a> Kliefoth concludes that Daniel, after he had recovered from his terror in the presence of the heavenly messenger, and had turned his mind to the contents of the vision, was thrown to the ground by the thought presented to him by the angel, that the vision had reference to the end of all things, and that, in order to raise him up, the angel said something else to him more comforting of the vision. But this conclusion has no foundation in the text. The circumstance that Daniel was not again cast to the ground by the communication of the angel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, is not to be accounted for by supposing that the angel now made known to him something more consoling; but it has its foundation in this, that the angel touched the prophet, who had fallen dismayed to the earth, and placed him again on his feet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>), and by means of this touch communicated to him the strength to hear his words. But the explanation which Kliefoth gives of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a> the words do not bear. "The last end of the indignation" must denote the time which will follow after the expiration of the &#1494;&#1506;&#1501;, i.e., the period of anger of the Babylonian Exile. But &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; means, when space is spoken of, that which is farthest (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-9.htm">Psalm 139:9</a>), and when time is spoken of, the last, the end, the opposite of &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, the end over against the beginning. If &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; does not denote such a time was follows an otherwise fixed termination, but the last time, the end-time (see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>), so also, since &#1494;&#1506;&#1501; is here the time of the revelation of the divine wrath, &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492; can only denote the last time, or the end-time, of the revelation of the divine wrath. This explanation of the words, the only one which the terms admit of, is also required by the closing words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, &#1511;&#1509; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (for at the time appointed the end). According to the example of the Vulg., quoniam habet tempus finem suum, and Luther's version, "for the end has its appointed time," Kliefoth translates the words, "for the firmly-ordained, definite time has its end," and refers this to the time of the Babylonish Exile, which indeed, as Daniel knew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>), was fixed by God to seventy years. But that in the Babylonish Exile will have its fixed end, will come to an end with the seventy years, the angel needed not to announce to the prophet, for he did not doubt it, and the putting him in remembrance of that fact would have afforded him but very poor consolation regarding the time of the future wrath. This conception of the words depends on the inaccurate interpretation of the words &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, and will consequently fall to the ground along with it. If &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; (to the appointment) were separated from &#1511;&#1509;, and were to be taken by itself, and to be understood of the time of the &#1494;&#1506;&#1501;, then it ought to have the article, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-27.htm">Daniel 11:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>. Without the article, as here, it must be connected with &#1511;&#1509;, and them, with &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; supplied as the subject from the context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>), is to be translated, as it is by almost all modern interpreters: for the vision relates to the appointed time of the end. But &#1506;&#1514;&#1511;&#1509;, the time of the end, and &#1511;&#1509; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, the appointed time of the end, is not the absolute end of all things, the time of the setting up of the regnum gloriae, and the time of the tribulation preceding the return of our Lord; but the time of the judgment of the world-kingdom and the setting up of the everlasting kingdom of God by the appearance of the Messiah, the end of &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and the commencement of the &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, the time of the &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>), which the apostle calls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>) &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, and speaks of as having then already come.</body></html>
