Other expositors, however, with more apparent reason, consider this verse as connected with the following words, and translate it thus: “Ye that are my people, and have obtained mercy, speak to your brethren and sisters, and plead with your mother,” &c. “Although the Israelites, in the days of Hosea, were in general corrupt, and addicted to idolatry; yet there were among them, in the worst times, some who had <span class="ital">not bowed the knee to Baal. </span>These were always <span class="ital">Ammi </span>and <span class="ital">Ruhamah; </span>God’s own people, and a darling daughter. God commissions these faithful few to admonish the inhabitants of the land in general, of the dreadful judgments that would be brought upon them by the gross idolatry of the Jewish Church and nation;” and to reprove, and use their best endeavours to reform that general corruption which the nation had contracted by its idolatry; whereby the people had broken the covenant God had made with them, and had caused a separation, or divorce, between him and them. <span class="ital">Let her therefore put away her whoredoms, </span>&c. — Let her leave off her idolatries.

The words form a climax of the love of God. First, the people scattered , unpitied , and disowned by God , is re-born of God; then it is declared to be in continued relation to God, "My people;" then to be the object of his yearning love. The words, "My people," may be alike filled up, "ye are My people," and "be ye My people." They are words of hope in prophecy, "ye shall be again My people;" they become words of joy in each stage of fulfillment. They are words of mutual joy and gratulation, when obeyed; they are words of encouragement, until obeyed. God is reconciled to us, and willeth that we be reconciled to Him. Among those who already are God's people, they are the voice of the joy of mutual love in the oneness of the Spirit of adoption; "we are His people;" to those without (whether the ten tribes, or the Jews of heretics,) they are the voice of those who know in whom they have believed, "Be ye also His people." Despair of the salvation of none, but, with brotherly love, call them to repentance and salvation."<p>This verse closes what went before, as God's reversal of His own sentence, and anticipates what is to come (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a> ff). God commands the prophets and all those who love Him, to appeal to those who forget Him, holding out to them the mercy in store for them also, if they will return to Him. He bids them not to despise those yet alien from Him, "but to treat as brethren and sisters, those whom God willeth to introduce into His house, and to call to the riches of His inheritance." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Ho 2:1-23.

These words are to be considered either in connection with the latter part of the preceding chapter, and as directed to the sons of the living God, who had not been, but now were, "Ammi", the Lord's people; and who had not, but now have, "Ruhamah", obtained mercy; which grace and mercy shown them, it became them to speak of one to another, to affect their hearts mutually with it, and to glorify God for it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a> as also to speak of it to their carnal relations, that so, if it was the will of God, it might be of use to them, to show them the state they were in, the danger of it, their need of the grace and mercy of God, and the hope there was by their own instance and example of obtaining it; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1</a>, or as directed to the converted Jews that appointed Christ their Head, and believed in him; exhorting them to own the believing Gentiles as their brethren and sisters, since they were the spiritual seed of Abraham their father, and walked in the steps of his faith; and to call them Ammi and Ruhamah, since they, who were not the people of God, now were, and who had not obtained mercy, now have obtained mercy, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>, or else they may be considered as in connection with the following words, <p>plead with your mother; and that either as spoken to the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, who were the people of God, retained the pure worship of God, and obtained mercy of the Lord, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-7.htm">Hosea 1:7</a>, <p>"O ye Ammi and Ruhamah, that are the Lord's people, and he has had mercy on; stir up and exhort your brethren and sisters of the ten tribes, for so they were, notwithstanding their separation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>, to contend with their mother, the body of the nation, about idolatry and departure from God;'' <p>or as spoken to the godly among the ten tribes, who were the real people of God, and sharers in his grace and mercy; the remnant he reserved for himself, who had not bowed their knees to idols; or as the command of God by the prophet, to the people of Israel, to exhort one another to contend with their mother, who were, as yet, the Lord's people, had mercy shown them, when this prophecy was delivered out; though, in case of obstinacy and impenitence, they were threatened with a "Loammi" and "Loruhamah"; so Schmidt, who thinks that "ammi" and "ruhamah" are put by way of "apposition to your brethren and sisters", in which he seems to be right. Aben Ezra thinks the words are spoken ironically, like those in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a>, and others, but without reason. The Targum is, <p>"O ye prophets, say to your brethren, and my people, and I will have mercy on your congregation;'' <p>but whether the words are spoken to the Jewish converts who first believed in Christ, were his people, received grace and mercy from him, and stood in the relation of brethren and sisters to one another, both in a natural and spiritual sense, to stir up one another to reprove their mother, the Jewish church, for rejecting Christ, saying, as follows: <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Say ye unto your <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</span><p>(a) Seeing that I have promised you deliverance, it remains that you encourage one another to embrace this promise, considering that you are my people on whom I will have mercy.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>.

The prophet sets forth in more intelligible language what he has already suggested rather enigmatically. The finest part of the chapter is from <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.">Hosea 2:14</a></span> to <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-23.htm" title="And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, You are my people; and they shall say, You are my God.">Hosea 2:23</a></span>, where Hosea shows how Israel will emerge purified from her captivity, and enjoy the love and favour of her Divine Bridegroom.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> refers to the same king, and says that he shall speak against the Most High. &#1500;&#1510;&#1491; means, properly, against or at the side of, and is more expressive than &#1506;&#1500;. It denotes that he would use language by which he would set God aside, regard and give himself out as God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. Making himself like God, he will destroy the saints of God. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, Pa., not "make unfortunate" (Hitzig), but consume, afflict, like the Hebr. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-9.htm">1 Chronicles 17:9</a>, and Targ. Jes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a>. These passages show that the assertion that &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, in the sense of to destroy, never takes after it the accusative of the person (Hitz.), is false. Finally, "he thinks to change times and laws." "To change times" belongs to the all-perfect power of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>), the creator and ordainer of times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>). There is no ground for supposing that &#1494;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; is to be specially understood of "festival or sacred times," since the word, like the corresponding Hebr. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, does not throughout signify merely "festival times;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-21.htm">Genesis 17:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>, etc. The annexed &#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; does not point to arrangements of divine worship, but denotes "law" or "ordinance" in general, human as well as divine law; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-13.htm">Daniel 2:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-15.htm">Daniel 2:15</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-6.htm">Daniel 6:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-9.htm">Daniel 6:9</a>. "Times and laws" are the foundations and main conditions, emanating from God, of the life and actions of men in the world. The sin of the king in placing himself with God, therefore, as Kliefoth rightly remarks, "consists in this, that in these ordinances he does not regard the fundamental conditions given by God, but so changes the laws of human life that he puts his own pleasure in the place of the divine arrangements." Thus shall he do with the ordinances of life, not only of God's people, but of all men. "But it is to be confessed that the people of God are most affected thereby, because they hold their ordinances of life most according to the divine plan; and therefore the otherwise general passage stands between two expressions affecting the conduct of the horn in its relation to the people of God."<p>This tyranny God's people will suffer "till, i.e., during, a time, (two) times, and half a time." By these specifications of time the duration of the last phase of the world-power is more definitely declared, as a period in its whole course measured by God; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a>. The plural word &#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (times) standing between time and half a time can only designate the simple plural, i.e., two times used in the dual sense, since in the Chaldee the plural is often used to denote a pair where the dual is used in Hebrew; cf. Winer, Chald. Gr. 55, 3. Three and a half times are the half of seven times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>). The greater number of the older as well as of the more recent interpreters take imte (&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503;) as representing the space of a year, thus three and a half times as three and a half years; and they base this view partly on <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>, where seven times must mean seven years, partly on <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>, where the corresponding expression is found in Hebrew, partly on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2-3</a>, where forty-two months and 1260 days are used interchangeably. But none of these passages supplies a proof that will stand the test. The supposition that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a> the seven times represent seven years, neither is nor can be proved. As regards the time and times in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>, and the periods named in the passages of the Rev. referred to, it is very questionable whether the weeks and the days represent the ordinary weeks of the year and days of the week, and whether these periods of time are to be taken chronologically. Still less can any explanation as to this designation of time be derived from the 2300 days (evening-mornings) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>, since the periods do not agree, nor do both passages treat of the same event. The choice of the chronologically indefinite expression &#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503;, time, shows that a chronological determination of the period is not in view, but that the designation of time is to be understood symbolically. We have thus to inquire after the symbolical meaning of the statement. This is not to be sought, with Hofmann (Weiss. i. 289), in the supposition that as three and a half years are the half of a Sabbath-period, it is thus announced that Israel would be oppressed during half a Sabbath-period by Antichrist. For, apart from the unwarrantable identification of time with year, one does not perceive what Sabbath-periods and the oppression of the people of God have in common. This much is beyond doubt, that three and a half times are the half of seven times. The meaning of this half, however, is not to be derived, with Kranichfeld, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>, where "seven times" is an expression used for a long continuance of divinely-ordained suffering. It is not hence to be supposed that the dividing of this period into two designates only a proportionally short time of severest oppression endured by the people of God at the hands of the heathen. For the humbling of the haughty ruler Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>) does not stand in any inner connection with the elevation of the world-power over the people of God, in such a way that we could explain the three and a half times of this passage after the seven times of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>. In general, the question may be asked, Whether the meaning of the three and a half times is to be derived merely from the symbolical signification of the number seven, or whether, with Lmmert, we must not much rather go back, in order to ascertain the import of this measure of time, to the divine judgments under Elias, when the heavens were shut for three years and six months; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>. "As Ahab did more to provoke God to anger than all the kings who were before him, so this king, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, in a way altogether different from those who went before him, spake words against the Most High and persecuted His saints, etc." But should this reference also not be established, and the three and a half times be regarded as only the half of seven times, yet the seven does not here come into view as the time of God's works, so that it could be said the oppression of the people of God by the little horn will last (Kliefoth) only half as long as a work of God; but according to the symbolical interpretation of the seven times, the three and a half, as the period of the duration of the circumstances into which the people of God are brought by the world-power through the divine permission, indicate "a testing period, a period of judgment which will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>), for the elect's sake, be interrupted and shortened (septenarius truncus)." Leyrer in Herz.'s Real. Enc. xviii. 369. Besides, it is to be considered how this space of time is described, not as three and a half, but a time, two times, and half a time. Ebrard (Offenb. p. 49) well remarks regarding this, that "it appears as if his tyranny would extend itself always the longer and longer: first a time, then the doubled time, then the fourfold - this would be a seven times; but it does not go that length; suddenly it comes to an end in the midst of the seven times, so that instead of the fourfold time there is only half a time." "The proper analysis of the three and a half times," Kliefoth further remarks, "in that the periods first mount up by doubling them, and then suddenly decline, shows that the power of the horn and its oppression of the people of God would first quickly manifest itself, in order then to come to a sudden end by the interposition of the divine judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-26.htm">Daniel 7:26</a>)." For, a thing which is not here to be overlooked, the three and a half times present not the whole duration of the existence of the little horn, but, as the half of a week, only the latter half of its time, in which dominion over the saints of God is given to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>), and at the expiry of which it falls before the judgment. See under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>.</body></html>
