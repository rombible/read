Lack of seasonable repentance increases the danger at this critical stage of Israel’s destiny. The latter part of the verse is missed in the rendering of the English version. Read, <span class= "ital">For at the right time he standeth not in the place where children break forth.</span> But the use of the Hebrew word for “at the right time” (‘<span class= "ital">ēth</span>) is doubtful. Perhaps the word should be read ‘<span class= "ital">attah</span> (“now”), as Buhl, in <span class= "ital">Zeitschrift für Kirchliche Wissenschaft,</span> suggests. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-34.htm" title="In the time when you shall be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company in the middle of you shall fall.">Ezekiel 27:34</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:9-16 Israel had destroyed himself by his rebellion; but he could not save himself, his help was from the Lord only. This may well be applied to the case of spiritual redemption, from that lost state into which all have fallen by wilful sins. God often gives in displeasure what we sinfully desire. It is the happiness of the saints, that, whether God gives or takes away, all is in love. But it is the misery of the wicked, that, whether God gives or takes away, it is all in wrath, nothing is comfortable. Except sinners repent and believe the gospel, anguish will soon come upon them. The prophecy of the ruin of Israel as a nation, also showed there would be a merciful and powerful interposition of God, to save a remnant of them. Yet this was but a shadow of the ransom of the true Israel, by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. He will destroy death and the grave. The Lord would not repent of his purpose and promise. Yet, in the mean time, Israel would be desolated for her sins. Without fruitfulness in good works, springing from the Holy Spirit, all other fruitfulness will be found as empty as the uncertain riches of the world. The wrath of God will wither its branches, its sprigs shall be dried up, it shall come to nothing. Woes, more terrible than any from the most cruel warfare, shall fall on those who rebel against God. From such miseries, and from sin, the cause of them, may the Lord deliver us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sorrows of a travailing woman are come upon him - The travail-pangs are violent, sudden, irresistible. A moment before they come, all is seemingly perfect health; they come, increase in vehemence, and, if they accomplish not that for which they are sent, end in death, both to the mother and the child. Such are God's chastisements. If they end not in the repentance of the sinner, they continue on in his destruction. But never is man more secure, than just before the last and final throe comes upon him. "The false security of Israel, when Samaria was on the point of falling into the hands of its enemies, was a picture of that of the synagogue, when greater evils were coming upon it. Never did the Jews less think that the axe was laid to the root of the trees." This blind presumption is ever found in a people whom God casts off. At the end of the world, amid the awful signs, the fore-runners of the Day of Judgment, people will be able to reassure themselves, and say, "Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>.<p>The prophet first compares Israel to the mother, in regard to the sufferings which are a picture of the sudden overwhelming visitations of God; then to the child, on whose staying or not staying in the womb, the welfare of both depends.<p>He is an unwise son, for he should not stay long - Senseless would be the child, which, if it had the power, lingered, hesitated, whether to come forth or no. While it lingers, at one time all but coming forth, then returning, the mother's strength is wasted, and both perish. Wonderful picture of the vacillating sinner, acted upon by the grace of God, but resisting it; at one time all but ready to pour out before his God the hidden burden which oppresses him, at the next, withholding it; impelled by his sufferings, yet presenting a passive resistance; almost constrained at times by some mightier pang, yet still with-held; until, at the last, the impulses become weaker, the pangs less felt, and he perishes with his unrepented sin.<p>: "He had said, that the unwise cannot bring forth, that the wise can. He had mentioned 'children,' i. e., such as are not still-born; who come forth perfect into the world. These, God saith, shall by His help be redeemed from everlasting destruction, and, at the same time, having predicted the destruction of that nation, He gives the deepest comfort to those who will to retain firm faith in Him, not allowing them to be utterly cast down." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. sorrows of a travailing woman&#8212;calamities sudden and agonizing (Jer 30:6).<p>unwise&#8212;in not foreseeing the impending judgment, and averting it by penitence (Pr 22:3).<p>he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children&#8212;When Israel might deliver himself from calamity by the pangs of penitence, he brings ruin on himself by so long deferring a new birth unto repentance, like a child whose mother has not strength to bring it forth, and which therefore remains so long in the passage from the womb as to run the risk of death (2Ki 19:3; Isa 37:3; 66:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The sorrows of a travailing woman:</span> by this simile, well known in Scripture, the prophet assures Ephraim that the punishment of his sins will overtake him suddenly, with very great anguish, and with as great certainty, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-3.htm" title="Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travails has brought forth: then the remnant of his brothers shall return to the children of Israel.">Micah 5:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall come upon him; </span> as suddenly, inevitably, and with as much danger too, if he be not the wiser, and return to his God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He, </span> i.e. Ephraim, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">is an unwise son; </span> a very foolish son, an inconsiderate child, who endangers himself and his mother. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children:</span> as a child that sticks in the birth, so Ephraim, just at the birth, hesitateth, one while will, another while will not, return to God; thus dieth under the delay. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hosea/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him,.... Upon Ephraim, or the ten tribes; that is, afflictions, distresses, and calamities, which are often in Scripture compared to the pains and sorrows of a woman in childbirth; and may denote the suddenness and inevitableness of them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>. So the Targum, <p>"distress and trouble shall come upon them, as pains on a woman with child;'' <p>which may respect the invasion of their land, the siege of Samaria, and their captivity; <p>he is an unwise son; taking no warning by his ancestors, by their sins, and what befell them on account of them, but persisting in his sins, and in impenitence and hardness of heart: so the Targum, <p>"he is not wise to know my fear:'' <p>for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children: that is, in the womb, as Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it; though the Targum and Jarchi understand it of the stool or seat of women in travail. The sense is, either that he is foolish and unwise, that he does not endeavour to extricate himself from these troubles; or rather to prevent them by repentance, by leaving his idols, and returning to the Lord; or that, should he do so, be would soon be delivered from all his sorrows, and not stay a moment longer in them. Though the words may be better rendered, "for he stays not", or "would not stay, the time for the breaking forth of children" (p); now this time is the time of the Gospel dispensation, the time of the Messiah's birth, the fulness of time appointed for his coming, and the time of the church's ringing forth many children in a spiritual sense; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>; for which Ephraim or the ten tribes should have waited, but did not, which was their folly and their ruin; they did not "stand", or continue, in the belief and expectation of the Messiah, and in the true worship of God, but left that, and served idols; and so continued not to the times of the Messiah, when the blessings mentioned in the following verse would be obtained and enjoyed; so Schmidt. <p>(p)      "nam tempus non subsistet in partitudine filiorum", Cocceius; "quia tempus non stat in utero puerorum", Schmidt; "quia tempore non stetissent in raptura alvi filiorum", Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he <i>is</i> an unwise son; for he should not stay long in <i>the place of</i> the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> breaking forth of children.</span><p>(i) But would come out of the womb, that is out of these dangers in which he is, and not wait to be suppressed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13, 14</span>. These verses, at least down to the last clause of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-14.htm" title="I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be your plagues; O grave, I will be your destruction: repentance shall be hid from my eyes.">Hosea 13:14</a></span>, seem a slight digression. The prophet declares that the troubles which are already closing around Israel, are in reality a last opportunity graciously vouchsafed of repentance. But he in his unwisdom neglects to embrace it, though every moment of delay increases his danger. Notice the two-fold application of the figure of childbirth. Israel is first of all the travailing woman, and then the child whose birth is imperilled by its weak will. Mr Huxtable well compares the abruptness with which St Paul shifts the application of an image; see e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:...">2 Corinthians 3:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:...">2 Corinthians 3:13-15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The sorrows … shall come</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">The pangs … come</span> (are in the process of coming). The divine judgment is compared to the pangs of trouble, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm" title="Now why do you cry out aloud? is there no king in you? is your counselor perished? for pangs have taken you as a woman in travail.">Micah 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-8.htm" title="All these are the beginning of sorrows.">Matthew 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he is an unwise son</span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm" title="Do you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, ‘Do ye thus requite Jehovah, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father’, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for he should not</span>, &c.] Or better, ‘for at the (right) time he standeth not’, &c. But as the rendering ‘at the (right) time’ is doubtful, it is better still to alter the points (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-34.htm" title="In the time when you shall be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company in the middle of you shall fall.">Ezekiel 27:34</a>) and render, <span class="bld">for now he standeth not in the place where children break forth.</span> The passage is akin to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-2.htm" title="And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.">Isaiah 37:2</a>, where Judah’s utter incapacity to emerge out of its troubles is compared to the inability of a woman to perform the act of bringing forth. Here, however, to suggest a moral lesson to Israel, the weak will of the child is represented as the cause of the failure. It is a new birth which Israel needs; and if calamity only had its right effect on the conscience, the language ascribed to Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-2.htm" title="After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.">Hosea 6:2</a> would be verified, ‘on the third day … we shall live in his sight.’ For the two-fold aspect in which Hosea here views the judgment, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm" title="Come, and let us return to the LORD: for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up.">Hosea 6:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him.</span> The threatened punishment that is to overtake them is compared to the throes of a parturient woman, on account of their severity, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>. Their sinfulness, which stands in the way of their success, shall be succeeded by severe sufferings and many sorrows. But eventually these worldly sorrows shall, under Divine grace, issue in the godly sorrows of repentance: then, and not till then, shall a new and happier period of existence be ushered in. The sorrow of travail shall give place to the joy of birth Delay of confession and repentance defers that joy, prolongs the sufferings, and puts the life of both parent and child in peril, so far as their personality is identical. <span class="cmt_word">He is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.</span> Here the unwisdom of Israel is accounted for: it is folly, sheer folly that postpones repentance, and delays efforts and aspirations after new spiritual life, The literal rendering of the last clause is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">For it is time, he should not tarry at the place of the breaking forth of children</span>; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">When it is time, he does not place himself</span> at (literally, <span class="accented">stand</span>) or come <span class="accented">forward to the opening of the womb</span>; and some translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "at the time," but that would rather require <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>; it might, indeed, be duration of time, and Aben Ezra so renders it: "Therefore at the time he will not stand in the breaking forth of children." Also Wunsche: "He is an unwise son, for at the time he stands not in the breaking forth of children." It might be expressed, as in the Authorized Version, with a slight modification; thus: For otherwise <span class="accented">he would not stand long time in the place of the breaking forth of children</span>. The figure is now shifted from the mother to the child; such abrupt and sudden transitions are not infrequent in Scripture, especially in the Pauline Epistles (setup. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-13.htm">2 Corinthians 3:13-16</a>). The danger is represented as extreme, as may be inferred from the similar expression, "The children are come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth." A perilous period in Israel's history is indicated, and to escape the danger he must make no tarrying, but advance at once into the new life of faith and repentance. Kimchi has the following comment: "Because he has compared his pains to the pain of a woman in travail, he says, 'The children are not wise,' as if he said, 'The coming generations, who have seen their fathers in affliction because of their iniquities, are not wise, and do not consider that distress has overtaken their fathers because of their iniquity; and turn not from the evil deeds of their fathers, but have done wickedness like them.'" He adds: "There are children lively by nature in their coming forth out of the womb; so also would these, if they were wise, not stay a single hour in distress, but immediately On returning to the Lord be delivered out of their distress." The LXX. omit the negative and render <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1fc7;</span>: "This wise son of thine [employed ironically] shall not stand [or, 'endure'] in the destruction of his children or people." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And I acquired her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a lethech of barley." &#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, with dagesh lene or dirimens (Ewald, 28, b), from ka&#770;ra&#770;h, to dig, to procure by digging, then generally to acquire (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-6.htm">Deuteronomy 2:6</a>), or obtain by trading (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-27.htm">Job 6:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-30.htm">Job 40:30</a>). Fifteen keseph are fifteen shekels of silver; the word shekel being frequently omitted in statements as to amount (compare Ges. 120, 4, Anm. 2). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-11.htm">Ezekiel 45:11</a>, the homer contained ten baths or ephahs, and a lethech (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, lxx) was a half homer. Consequently the prophet gave fifteen shekels of silver and fifteen ephahs of barley; and it is a very natural supposition, especially if we refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-18.htm">2 Kings 16:18</a>, that at that time an ephah of barley was worth a shekel, in which case the whole price would just amount to the sum for which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>, it was possible to purchase a slave, and was paid half in money and half in barley. The reason for the latter it is impossible to determine with certainty. The price generally, for which the prophet obtained the wife, was probably intended to indicate the servile condition out of which Jehovah purchased Israel to be His people; and the circumstance that the prophet gave no more for the wife than the amount at which a slave could be obtained, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/21-32.htm">Ecclesiastes 21:32</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12</a>, and that this amount was not even paid in money, but half of it in barley - a kind of food so generally despised throughout antiquity (vile hordeum; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>) - was intended to depict still more strikingly the deeply depressed condition of the woman. The price paid, moreover, is not to be regarded as purchase money, for which the wife was obtained from her parents; for it cannot be shown that the custom of purchasing a bride from her parents had any existence among the Israelites (see my Bibl. Archologie, ii. 109, 1). It was rather the marriage present (mo&#772;har), which a bridegroom gave, not to the parents, but to the bride herself, as soon as her consent had been obtained. If, therefore, the woman was satisfied with fifteen shekels and fifteen ephahs of barley, she must have been in a state of very deep distress. </body></html>
