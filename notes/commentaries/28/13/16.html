This may well be applied to the case of spiritual redemption, from that lost state into which all have fallen by wilful sins. God often gives in displeasure what we sinfully desire. It is the happiness of the saints, that, whether God gives or takes away, all is in love. But it is the misery of the wicked, that, whether God gives or takes away, it is all in wrath, nothing is comfortable. Except sinners repent and believe the gospel, anguish will soon come upon them. The prophecy of the ruin of Israel as a nation, also showed there would be a merciful and powerful interposition of God, to save a remnant of them. Yet this was but a shadow of the ransom of the true Israel, by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. He will destroy death and the grave. The Lord would not repent of his purpose and promise. Yet, in the mean time, Israel would be desolated for her sins. Without fruitfulness in good works, springing from the Holy Spirit, all other fruitfulness will be found as empty as the uncertain riches of the world. The wrath of God will wither its branches, its sprigs shall be dried up, it shall come to nothing. Woes, more terrible than any from the most cruel warfare, shall fall on those who rebel against God. From such miseries, and from sin, the cause of them, may the Lord deliver us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Samaria shall become desolate - Or "shall bear her iniquity." Her iniquity should now find her out, and rest upon her. Of this, "desolation" was, in God's judgments, the consequence. Samaria, "the nursery of idolatry and rebellion against God," the chief in pride should be chief in punishment. "For she hath rebelled against her God." It aggravated her sin, that He "against" whom "she rebelled," was "her" own "God." He who had chosen her to be His, and made Himself her God; who had showed Himself "her" God in the abundance of His loving-kindness, from the deliverance out of Egypt to that day. This her desolation, it is again said, should be Complete. Hope remains, if the people of a generation are cut off; yet not only should these fall by the sword; those already born were to be dashed in pieces; those as yet unborn were to be sought out for destruction, even in their mother's womb. Such atrocities were common then. Elisha foretold to Hazael that he would perpetrate both cruelties <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, Shalmaneser clashed the young children in pieces <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-14.htm">2 Kings 10:14</a>, as did the conqueror of NoAmmon <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>, and the Babylonians <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-9.htm">Psalm 137:9</a> afterward. The children of Ammon ripped up the women with child in Gilead <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>, and the usurper Menahem in Tiphsah and its coasts <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>. Isaiah prophesies that Babylon should undergo, in its turn, the same as to its children <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16</a>, and the Psalmist pronounces God's blessing on its destroyer who should so requite him <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-9.htm">Psalm 137:9</a>.<p>Such was to be the end of the pride, the ambition, the able policy, the wars, the oppressions, the luxury, the self-enjoyment, and, in all, the rebellion of Samaria against "her" God. She has stood the more in opposition to God, the nearer she might have been to Him, and "bare her iniquity." As a city of God's people, it was never restored. The spot, in its pagan colonists, with which Assyrian policy repopulated it <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>, was still the abode of a mingled religion. Corruption clung, by inheritance, to its site. This too was destroyed by John Hyrcanus. "He effaced thee marks that it had ever been a city" . It was rebuilt by the Romans, after Pompey had taken Jerusalem . Herod reenclosed a circuit of two miles and a half of the ancient site, fortified it strongly, as a check on the Jews; repopulated it, partly with some who had served in his wars, partly with the people around; gave them lands, revived their idolatry by replacing their poor temple by one remarkable for size and beauty, in an area of a furlong and a half; and called the place Sebaste in honor of his pagan patron, Augustus .<p>A coin of Nero, struck there, bears the figure (it is thought) of its old idol, Ashtaroth . Jerome says, that John the Baptist was buried there . The pagan, who were encouraged in such desecrations by Julian the Apostate , opened the tomb, burned the bones, and scattered the dust . The city became a Christian See, and its Bishops were present at the four first General Councils . It is now but a poor village, connected with the strongly-fortified town of Herod by its pagan name Sebastieh, a long avenue of broken pillars, and the tomb of the great Forerunner . Of the ancient capital of Ephraim, not even a ruin speaks.<p>The prophet closes this portion of his prophecy, as other prophets so often do, with the opposite end of the righteous and the wicked. He had spoken of the victory over death, the irrevocable purpose of God for good to his own; then he speaks of utter final destruction. Then when the mercy of God shall be shown to the uttermost, and the victory over sin and death shall be accomplished, then shall all the pomp of the its riches, joys, luxuries, elegance, glory, dignity; perish and not a wreck be left behind of all which once dazzled the eyes of people, for which they forsook their God, and sold themselves to evil and the evil one. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

And this was no doubt executed upon Samaria when it was taken, so their springs (women and children, which are as fountains) were all dried up. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hosea/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Samaria shall become desolate,.... With this verse the fourteenth chapter begins in the Hebrew copies, and in the Targum, and in many versions; but seems better to conclude the present chapter; since it is in close connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>, and explains the figurative expressions there used. Samaria was the head of Ephraim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a>; or the metropolis of the ten tribes of Israel; whose desolation is here prophesied of, and was accomplished by Shalmaneser king of Assyria, signified by the east wind; by whom it was not only besieged and taken, but very probably its houses were demolished, its walls broken down, and razed to the very foundation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>; and, as this was the head city, it may be put for all the rest, and even for the whole land, which was at the same time laid waste. The Targum is, <p>"Samaria shall be guilty;'' <p>that is, shall be found guilty of many sins; her transgression shall be revealed, as Jarchi, become manifest by the just punishment inflicted on her; <p>for she hath rebelled against her God; and bitterly provoked him to wrath and anger, as the word (u) signifies; by relinquishing him and his worship, and by serving idols, the calves at Dan and Bethel, Baal and other idols; when the Lord was their God, not only by creation, as of all men, but by the choice he made of them, and the covenant he made with them; by a national adoption of them, attended with various blessings and privileges, and by their profession of him; all which were an aggravation of their rebellion against him; <p>they shall fall by the sword: the inhabitants of Samaria, and of the land, particularly the men thereof; and especially their armed men, their men of war, that fought for them, and defended them; these should fall by the sword of the Assyrian; <p>their children shall be dashed to pieces; against stones, walls, and pavements; who should have perpetuated their name to future ages, and inherited their possessions: <p>and their women with child shall be ripped up; things which are often done by cruel enemies, when cities are sacked and plundered; and which Shalmaneser might be provoked unto by the perfidy of the king of Israel, and by the city of Samaria holding out a three years' siege. This, though we have no account of as done at that time, yet no doubt was; even as the same things are predicted of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, and which were to be done to them, in retaliation for them, though there is no narrative of them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>. <p>(u) "ad amaritudinem concitavit", V.

In the latter sense it is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span>, to atone or suffer the punishment of contracted guilt; in the former sense it is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dd;</span>, and it is translated accordingly by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;</span> in the LXX., and <span class="accented">pereat</span> by Jerome; so also Aben Ezra: "It shall be laid waste;" Kimchi: "The <span class="accented">aleph</span> has <span class="accented">seh'wa</span> alone, and the signification 'desolation,' and so the dwellers therein shall be made desolate." He thus intimates that <span class="accented">aleph</span>, having <span class="accented">sch'aa</span> alone without seghol, does not belong to the root, which is not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span> (for its future would be <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dd;</span>), but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>. Rashi, however, understands it in the sense of "atone," or "find out her guiltiness;" he says, "From now will her guilt manifest itself." The reason of Samaria being thus mentioned is not only that it was the capital of the northern kingdom, but, as Kimchi says, "it confirmed Israel in the worship of the calves; for if the kings had been good, they would have brought back Israel to what was good." The <span class="accented">ki</span> assigns the reason of Samaria's desolation or guilt; it was rebellion against Jehovah, for Samaria was the seat and center of idolatry, and hence it spread throughout the land. <span class="cmt_word">They shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</span> The destruction thus described was to be complete. The present population would perish by the sword; the future progeny would be extinguished and all posterity cut off. Not only the children already born, but those unborn, were devoted to destruction; and all this in the most savage and barbarous manner. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, to meddle, gratify one's self, indulge one's caprice) presents childhood on the side of playfulness or petulance. The pronominal suffix attached to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span> refers to the city; and the feminine noun itself, forming subject to verbs in the masculine, arises from the fact that the feminine of the imperfect plural becomes rarer; or because the feminine plural only gradually distinguishes itself by a peculiar form from the masculine. The cruelties here specified may have been occasioned by those of the same kind with which Menahem King of Samaria smote Tiphsah. On that occasion "all the women therein that were with child he ripped up" (compare, for the cruel practice, 'Iliad,' 6:58; ,<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a> and 2 Kings 15:16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Afterward will the sons of Israel turn and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king, and will go trembling to Jehovah and to His goodness at the end of the days." This section, like the previous one, closes with the announcement of the eventual conversation of Israel, which was not indicated in the symbolical action which precedes it, but is added to complete the interpretation of the symbol. Seeking Jehovah their God is connected with seeking David their king. For just as the falling away of the ten tribes from the royal house of David was merely the sequel and effect of their inward apostasy from Jehovah, and was openly declared in the setting up of the golden calves; the true return to the Lord cannot take place without a return to David their king, since God has promised the kingdom to David and his seed for ever (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), and therefore David is the only true king of Israel (their king). This King David, however, is no other than the Messiah. For although David received the promise of the everlasting continuance of his government, not with reference to his own person, but for his seed, i.e., his family; and on the ground of this promise, the whole of the royal house of David is frequently embraced under the expression "King David," so that we might imagine that David is introduced here, not as an individual, but as signifying the Davidic family; yet we must not understand it on this account as referring to such historical representatives of the Davidic government as Zerubbabel, and other earthly representatives of the house of David, since the return of the Israelites to "their King David" was not to take place till 'acha&#770;r&#305;&#772;th hayya&#770;m&#305;&#772;m (the end of the days). For "the end of the days" does not denote the future generally, but always the closing future of the kingdom of God, commencing with the coming of the Messiah (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>). Pa&#770;chad 'el Yehova&#770;h, to shake or tremble to Jehovah, is a pregnant expression for "to turn to Jehovah with trembling;" i.e., either trembling at the holiness of God, in the consciousness of their own sinfulness and unworthiness, or else with anguish and distress, in the consciousness of their utter helplessness. It is used here in the latter sense, as the two parallels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>. "in their affliction they will seek me," and <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a>, "they shall tremble as a bird," etc., clearly show. This is also required by the following expression, &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;, which is to be understood, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a>, as denoting the goodness of God manifested in His gifts. Affliction will drive them to seek the Lord, ad His goodness which is inseparable from Himself (Hengstenberg). Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>, where "the goodness of the Lord" is explained as corn, new wine, oil, lambs, and oxen, these being the gifts that come from the goodness of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-17.htm">Zechariah 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>). He who has the Lord for his God will want no good thing. </body></html>
