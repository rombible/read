When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests.

Wherefore God often claimed these titles to Himself, from the time He revealed Himself to Israel. In the song of Moses, which they were commanded to rehearse, He says, "See now that I, I am He, and there is no God with Me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; neither is there any that can deliver out of My hand" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>. Isaiah repeats this same, "Is there a God besides Me? yea there is no God; I know not any" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-8.htm">Isaiah 44:8</a>; and "There is no God else besides Me, a just God and a Saviour; there is none else. Look unto Me and be ye saved, for I am God and there is none else" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-21.htm">Isaiah 45:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a>; and, "I am the Lord, that is My Name; and My glory will I not give to another; neither My praise to graven images" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>. : "That God and Saviour is Christ; God, because He created; Saviour, because, being made Man, He saved. Whence He willed to be called Jesus, i. e., Saviour. Truly "beside" Him, "there is no Saviour; neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>. "It is not enough to recognize in God this quality of a Saviour. It must not be shared with "any other."

The use of an idolatrous symbol has so unspiritualized the object of their worship that the mere retention of the name Jehovah gives them no claim upon Hosea’s sympathy. The prophet therefore introduces Jehovah as expostulating with the Israelites for the abandonment of their hereditary religion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou shalt know no god but me</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">thou knowest,</span> &c.; the experience of history bore witness to Jehovah’s help, and his alone. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-12.htm" title="So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.">Deuteronomy 32:12</a>. Hosea however does not deny the existence of other gods besides Jehovah; only their equality to Him in power. It was only by degrees that the truth involved in the revelation of Jehovah was fully realized. See Introduction.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - These verses make it evident that the punishment inflicted on Israel could not reasonably be accounted too severe; such had been the goodness of Jehovah and the gross ingratitude of Israel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt</span>. The prophet here commences a recital of God's favors to Israel from ancient times, all which they forgot, ungratefully and impiously turning aside from the worship of Jehovah. Jehovah had been Israel's God long before, but never before had the evidence of his power and love to his people been so signal and conspicuous as at the period of the Exodus and onward. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt know no god but me.</span> The use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span> in the imperfect is to connect the future with the past. It may be rendered either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Thou knowest," viz. a God of such wonderful attestation thou knowest or findest not beside me - the opposite of the statement, "Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-3.htm">Deuteronomy 13:3</a>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Thou shouldest not know or recognize any god beside me." So Kimchi: "Thou shouldest not know other gods, nor serve them beside me, for ye see there is no helper Beside me." Likewise Rashi: "Thou shouldest not rebel against me." Also Aben Ezra: "How hast thou turned to kiss the calf, which does not save nor satisfy, and hast left him who has been thy God from ancient days, who has helped thee and knows all thy necessities." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>, which, as the cognate Arabic signifies, "to go forth or away") is synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And it comes to pass in that day, is the saying of Jehovah, thou wilt call, My husband; and thou wilt no more call to me, My Baal." The church will then enter once more into the right relation to its God. This thought is expressed thus, that the wife will no more call her husband Baal, but husband. Ba&#8219;al is not to be taken as an appellative in the sense of master, as distinguished from '&#305;&#772;sh, man, i.e., husband, for ba'al does not mean master or lord, but owner, possessor; and whenever it is applied to a husband in an appellative sense, it is used quite promiscuously with 'iish (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-26.htm">2 Samuel 11:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>). Moreover, the context in this instance, especially the Be&#8219;a&#770;l&#305;&#772;m in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19</a>, decidedly requires that Ba&#8219;al should be taken as a proper name. Calling or naming is a designation of the nature or the true relation of a person or thing. The church calls God her husband, when she stands in the right relation to Him; when she acknowledges, reveres, and loves Him, as He has revealed Himself, i.e., as the only true God. On the other hand, she calls Him Baal, when she places the true God on the level of the Baals, either by worshipping other gods along with Jehovah, or by obliterating the essential distinction between Jehovah and the Baals, confounding together the worship of God and idolatrous worship, the Jehovah-religion and heathenism. </body></html>
