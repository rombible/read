Ephraim was consumed by the unhallowed fire of Baal-worship, with all its passion and sensualism—a cake burnt on one side to a cinder, and on the other left in a condition utterly unfit for food. So the activity of foreign idolatries and foreign alliances, and the consequent unfaithfulness to Israel’s God, are the nation’s ruin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hosea/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/7-8.htm" title="Ephraim, he has mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned....">Hosea 7:8-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ephraim, he hath mixed among the people — </span>By his alliances with the heathen, and by imitation of their manners, he is himself become one of them.

There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves.

God had forbidden all intermarriage with the pagan <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-16</a>, lest His people should corrupt themselves: they thought themselves wiser than He, intermarried, and were corrupted.

"Ephraim" had been "mingled," steeped, kneaded up into one, as it were, "with the pagan," their ways, their idolatries, their vices. God would amend them, and they, withholding themselves from His discipline, and not yielding themselves wholly to it, were but spoiled. The sort of cake, to which Ephraim is here likened, "uggah"  literally, "circular," was a thin pancake, to which a scorching heat was applied on one side; sometimes by means of hot charcoal heaped upon it; sometimes, (it is thought,) the fire was within the earthen jar, around which the thin dough was fitted. If it remained long "unturned," it was burned on the one side; while it continued unbaked, doughy, recking, on the other; the fire spoiling, not penetrating it through. Such were the people; such are too many so-called Christians; they united in themselves hypocrisy and ungodliness, outward performance and inward lukewarmness; the one overdone, but without any wholesome effect on the other. The one was scorched and black; the other, steamed, damp, and lukewarm; the whole worthless, spoiled irremediably, fit only to be cast away. The fire of God's judgment, with which the people should have been amended, made but an outward impression upon them, and reached not within, nor to any thorough change, so that they were the more hopelessly spoiled through the means which God used for their amendment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. mixed &#8230; among the people&#8212;by leagues with idolaters, and the adoption of their idolatrous practices (Ho 7:9, 11; Ps 106:35).<p>Ephraim &#8230; cake not turned&#8212;a cake burnt on one side and unbaked on the other, and so uneatable; an image of the worthlessness of Ephraim.

Either locally, by dwelling among them, as some of them at least might do among the Syrians; or carnally, by intermarrying with them, contrary to the command of God; or civilly, by entering into alliances and confederacies with them, as Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel did with Rezin king of Syria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>; or by seeking to them for help, calling to Egypt, and going to Assyria, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; so Aben Ezra; or morally, by learning their manners, and conforming to their customs, especially in religious things: though some understand this as a punishment threatened them for their above sins, that they should be carried captive into foreign lands, and so be mixed among the people, and which is Jarchi's sense: but it is rather to be considered as their evil in joining with other nations in their superstition, idolatry, and other impieties; and it is highly offensive to God when his professing people mix themselves with the world, keep company with the men of it, fashion themselves according to them, do as they do, and wilfully go into their conversation, and repeat it, and continue therein, and resolve to do so: for so it may be rendered, "he will mix himself" (r); it denotes a voluntary act, repeated and persisted in with obstinacy; <p>Ephraim is a cake not turned; like a cake that is laid on coats, if it is not turned, the nether part will be burnt, and the upper part unbaked, and so be good for noticing; not fit to be eaten, being nothing indeed, neither bread nor dough; and so may signify, that Ephraim having introduced much of the superstition and idolatry of the Gentiles into religious worship, was nothing in religion, neither fish nor flesh, as is proverbially said of persons and things of which nothing can be made; they worshipped the calves at Dan and Bethel, and Yet swore by the name of the Lord; they halted between two opinions, and were of neither; they were like the hotch potch inhabitants of Samaria in later times, that came in their place, that feared the Lord, and served their own gods: and such professors of religion there are, who are nothing in religion; nothing in principle, they have no scheme of principles; they are neither one thing nor another; they are nothing in experience; if they have a form of godliness, they deny the power of it; they are nothing in practice, all they do is to be seen of men; they are neither hot nor cold, especially not throughout, or on both sides, like a cake unturned; but are lukewarm and indifferent, and therefore very disagreeable to the Lord. Some take this to be expressive of punishment, and not of fault; either of their partial captivity by Tiglathpileser, when only a part of them was carried captive; or of the swift and total destruction of them by their enemies, who would be like hungry and half starved persons, who meeting with a cake on the coals half baked, snatch it up, and eat it, not staying for the turning and baking it on the other side; and thus it should be with them.

The explanation is plausible, as long as we look at the figure by itself. But the context, which refers only to Israel’s political decline, favours another view. ‘A brand snatched from the burning’ is a figure of a country, rescued only just in time from destruction. Hosea’s ‘cake not turned’ may equally well be an emblem of a country half ruined by calamities, and not rescued. The calamities of Israel, alas! are of his own making; by mingling with ‘the peoples’ he sought for warmth, but found a destroying conflagration (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-14.htm" title="Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.">Isaiah 47:14</a>). The ‘cake’ is the round flat cake of bread which was baked on hot stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-6.htm" title="And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.">1 Kings 19:6</a>) or on hot ashes, and required frequent turning, to prevent its being burned.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</span> The people of the northern kingdom had fallen away from Jehovah, and mixed themselves with the heathen nationalities. They resembled a cake which, through neglect of turning, was burnt on the one side and raw on the other. The best commentary on the first clause of this verse is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-35.htm">Psalm 106:35, 36</a>, and 39; they "were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.... Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a-whoring with their own inventions." The second clause is well explained by Bishop Horsley as follows: "One thing on one side, another on the other; burnt to a coal at bottom, raw dough at the top. An apt image of a character that is all inconsistencies. Such were the ten tribes of the prophet's day; worshippers of Jehovah in profession, but adopting all the idolatries of the neighboring nations, in addition to their own semi-idolatry of the calves." Similarly, the Geneva Bible has, "Baked on one side and raw on the ether, he is neither through hot nor through cold, but partly a Jew and partly a Gentile." Jehovah had chosen Israel out of the nations of the earth, and given them a special constitution. The object of this segregation was that Israel should be a peculiar people and a holy nation. Thus distinguished, they were to dwell alone; but, ungrateful for this high distinction, and unmindful of their high destiny, they mingled with the nations, learned their heathenish ways, and worshipped their hateful idols. Thus they forfeited their theocratic pre-eminence. While it was their privilege as well u duty to follow the precepts of Jehovah, and serve him with undivided affection, they fell away from his service and adopted the idolatries and habits of the heathen; it was only a just retribution, therefore, when God gave them ever into the hand of those heathen peoples to waste their resources and leave them shorn of their strength. The second clause is the counterpart of this; exactly like the peoples subsequently brought from Assyria, and planted in the lands of the <span class="accented">dispossessed</span> Israelites, they worshipped the Lord, but served their own gods - they were neither true worshippers of Jehovah nor out-and-out followers of Baal. In religion they were <span class="accented">mongrels - inconsistent</span> and worthless hybrids; they were, in fact, what Calvin in rather homely phrase says of them," neither flesh nor <span class="accented">fish</span>." The comment of Kimchi is concise as it is clear: "The prophet means to say, He (Israel) mixes himself among the peoples; though God - blessed be he I - separated them from them, yet they mix them. selves among them and do according to their works." His explanation of the second clause is not so satisfactory when he says, "<span class="accented">As</span> a cake which is baked upon the coals; if they do not turn it, it is burnt below and not baked above, so is the counsel that is not right when they do not turn it from side to side (sense to sense) until they bring it upon their wheels (into action). So (thoughtless and hasty) is Ephraim in his determination to serve the calves and other gods without proving and choosing what is good." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Other explanations need only be referred to in order to be rejected, as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of Rashi, who is followed by Grotius. He takes the verb in the future sense: "<span class="accented">Ephraim</span> in exile shall be mixed among the peoples." But it is obviously the present, not the future time, that is intended - the present sin, not its future punishment. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the explanation of Aben Ezra, followed by Eichhorn and Maurer, referring to the alliances or treaties which the northern kingdom formed with their neighbors to repel their enemies, and by which the resources of the land were consumed; while the second clause, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> according to Aben Ezra, refers to the over-hastiness and thoughtlessness with which Israel proceeded in their resolutions; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> according to Maurer, Jerome, and Theodoret, it signifies what is spoiled, ill-advised, and worthless. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first verse of the eleventh chapter belongs to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>; the &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (also I) is emphatically placed over against the mention of Michael, whereby the connection of this verse with <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a> is placed beyond a doubt, and at the same time the reference of &#1500;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-1.htm">Daniel 11:1</a>) to &#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>b) is decided. Hengstenberg indeed thinks (Christol. iii. 2, p. 53) that the reference of the &#1500;&#1493; to Michael is "against all that is already spoken in relation to Michael, and particularly against that which immediately goes before," under a reference to Hitzig. But Hitzig only says that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a> Michael is of one lineage with the speaker; but, on the contrary, the expressions &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511; (to confirm) and &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; (to strengthen) are so strong, that in &#1500;&#1493; we must think on one inferior, a man. Moreover, Hitzig can think of nothing done by Michael under Darius, since the transference of the kingdom to the Medes changed nothing in the fortune of the Jews. This was first effected by Cyrus. But Hengstenberg himself does not recognise this last reason, but remarks that <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-1.htm">Daniel 11:1</a> relates to the transference of the sovereignty from the Chaldeans to the Persians, whereby a way was opened for the return of Israel, and rightly, with Hv., thus determines the meaning of the verse in general: "As at that time the Lord made the change of the monarchy a cause of blessing to the covenant people, so in all the troubles that may arise to them in the heathen monarchies He will show Himself to be the same true and gracious God." The other reason, namely, that the strong expressions, "to confirm and strengthen," necessitate us to think of one inferior as referred to in &#1500;&#1493;, affects only the view already refuted above, that the speaker is either Gabriel or another inferior angel. If, on the contrary, the speaker is one person with him who is clothed in linen, i.e., with the Angel of the Lord, who is like unto God, then this person can also say of himself that he was a help and protection to the angel-prince Michael, because he stands higher than Michael; and the reference of the &#1500;&#1493; to Michael, which the "also I" in contrast to "Michael your prince" demands, corresponds wholly with that which is said of Michael. Besides, the reference of &#1500;&#1493; to Darius (Hv., Hengstb.) is excluded by this, that the name of Darius the Mede is not at all the object of the statements of the verse to which &#1500;&#1493; could refer, but occurs only in a subordinate or secondary determination of time. The thought of the verse is accordingly the following: "In the first year of Darius the Mede, Michael effected this, that Babylon, which was hostile to the people of God, was overthrown by the power of Medo-Persia, in doing which the Angel of the Lord rendered to him powerful help." To this follows in order in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-2.htm">Daniel 11:2</a> the announcement of the future, which is introduced by the formula '&#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; resumed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>. </body></html>
