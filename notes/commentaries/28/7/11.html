In this powerful metaphor we have a political allusion. King Hoshea is called <span class= "ital">Ausih</span> on the Assyrian monuments. Having usurped the throne after the murder of Pekah, he “purchased his recognition as king of Israel by giving a large present to the Assyrian monarch” (730 B.C.). (See Geo. Smith, <span class= "ital">Assyria</span>—S.P.C.K.) But while Hoshea was sending tribute to Assyria he was secretly coquetting with Egypt. The alliance between Egypt and the king of Israel, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2Kings 17:4</a>, took place later, after Tiglath-pileser’s death, and led to Israel’s ruin. On the other hand, many commentators (Ewald, Nowack, &c.) refer the allusions of this verse to the reign of Menahem.<p><span class= "bld">Without heart.—</span>Better, <span class= "ital">without understanding.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hosea/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/7-11.htm" title="Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria....">Hosea 7:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ephraim is like a silly dove without heart — </span>Which has neither courage to defend itself, nor cunning to prevent its falling into the snares that are laid for it. <span class="ital">They call to Egypt, </span>&c. — Sometimes they seek the alliance of one nation, and sometimes of another, all equally unserviceable to them; but are under no concern to seek the favour and protection of God, which alone can be of real and lasting benefit to them. <span class="ital">When they shall go — </span>When they shall do every thing their inclinations lead them to do, make the alliances they desire, and seek for safety in all the ways their imaginations can invent; <span class="ital">I will spread my net upon them — </span>I will entangle and disappoint them in their designs, execute my decrees upon them, and bring them to destruction, like as birds are taken in the snares of the fowler, although they have wings to fly out of danger. <span class="ital">I will chastise them as their congregation hath heard — </span>I will bring those calamities upon them which I have denounced in my laws against the whole people of Israel, whenever they should forsake me; and also have repeatedly denounced them by my prophets.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:8-16 Israel was as a cake not turned, half burnt and half dough, none of it fit for use; a mixture of idolatry and of the worship of Jehovah. There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves.

Simplicity is good or bad, not in itself, but according to some other qualities of the soul, good or evil, with which it is united, to which it opens the mind, and which lead it to good or mislead it to evil. The word  describes one, easily persuaded, open, and so, one who takes God's word simply, obeys His will, without refinement or subtlety or explaining it away; in which way it is said, "The Lord preserveth the simple;" or, on the other hand, one who lets himself easily be led to evil, as the pagan said of youth, that they were "like wax to be bent to evil" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-6.htm">Psalm 116:6</a>. In this way, it is said, "How long, ye simple one, will ye love simplicity?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>. Our Lord uses this likeness of the dove, for good, "be wise as serpents, simple, or harmless as doves" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>. Hosea speaks of simplicity without wisdom, for he adds, "a silly dove without understanding," (literally, "without a heart,") whereby they should love God's will, and so should understand it. Ephraim "became," he says, like a silly dove. Neglecting God's calls, unmoved by calamity or sufferings, and not "seeking" to God "for all this" which He has done to recall them, they grew in folly. Man is ever "growing in wisdom" or in folly, in grace or in gracelessness. This new stage of folly lay in their flying to Assyria, to help them, in fact, against God; as it follows,<p>They call to Egypt - Instead of "calling to" God who could and would help, they "called to Egypt" who could not, and "went to Assyria" who would not. So God complains by Isaiah, "To Me, thou hast not called, O Jacob" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-22.htm">Isaiah 43:22</a>. This was their folly; they called not to God, who had delivered them out of Egypt, but, alternately, to their two powerful neighbors, of whom Egypt was a delusive promiser, not failing only, but piercing, those who leant on it; Assyria was a powerful oppressor. Yet what else is almost the whole history of Christian states? The "balance of power," which has been the pride of the later policy of Europe, which has been idolized as a god, to which statesmen have looked, as a deliverance out of all their troubles; as if it were a sort of divine providence, regulating the affairs of human beings, and dispensing with the interference of God; what is it but the self-same wisdom, which balanced Egypt against Assyria? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. like a silly dove&#8212;a bird proverbial for simplicity: easily deceived.<p>without heart&#8212;that is, understanding.<p>call to Egypt&#8212;Israel lying between the two great rival empires Egypt and Assyria, sought each by turns to help her against the other. As this prophecy was written in the reign of Hoshea, the allusion is probably to the alliance with So or Sabacho II (of which a record has been found on the clay cylindrical seals in Koyunjik), which ended in the overthrow of Hoshea and the deportation of Israel (2Ki 17:3-6). As the dove betrays its foolishness by fleeing in alarm from its nest only to fall into the net of the fowler, so Israel, though warned that foreign alliances would be their ruin, rushed into them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ephraim:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-1.htm" title="When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief comes in, and the troop of robbers spoils without.">Hosea 7:1</a>,8</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is like a silly dove; </span> a deceived dove, seduced by false prophets and idolatrous priests, whose weak arguments are soon believed, and whose unseasonable advice is too soon followed: Ephraim is now become like the dove in weakness and fear, as well as in imprudence and liableness to be deceived. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Without heart:</span> this explains the former, whether heart here be judgment and discretion, as sometimes it is, or be resolution and courage, as other while it is; this dove, this Ephraim, wants both. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They call; </span> they should in their perplexity call on God, who can help, but they do not; they call indeed, but not to their God, or to a friend. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To Egypt:</span> this Hoshea did, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2 Kings 17:4</a></span>; and I remember not any mention of other application to Egypt since Jehu’s time. It is probable Hosea aims at this embassy, and private confederacy, of which, as of a thing in hand, he speaketh.

Or understanding; which comes and picks up the corns of grain, which lie scattered about, and does not know that the net is spread for it; and when its young are taken away, it is unconcerned, and continues its nest in the same place still; and, when frightened, flees not to its dove house, where it would be safe, but flies about here and there, and so becomes a prey to others. Thus Ephraim, going to Egypt and Assyria for help, were ensnared by them, not having sense enough to perceive that this would be their ruin; and though they had heretofore suffered by them, yet still they continued to make their addresses to them; and instead of keeping close to the Lord, and to his worship and the place of it, and asking counsel and help of him they ran about and sought for it here and there: <p>they call to Egypt; that is, for help; as Hoshea king of Israel, when he sent messengers to So or Sabacon king of Egypt, for protection and assistance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>. Such a foolish part, like the silly doves, did they act; since the Egyptians had been their implacable enemies, and their fathers had been in cruel bondage under them: <p>they go to Assyria; send gifts and presents, and pay tribute to the kings thereof, to make them easy; as Menahem did to Pul, and Hoshea to Shalmaneser, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>.

This verse does not begin a fresh section, but is closely connected with the preceding. As a dove, fleeing from a hawk, is snared in the fowler’s net, so Ephraim, when afraid of Assyria, calls in the assistance of Egypt, and when afraid of Egypt, applies to Assyria (see Introduction). In his folly he does not observe the snare which the false friend, or rather (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-12.htm" title="When they shall go, I will spread my net on them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.">Hosea 7:12</a></span>) Jehovah, prepares for him.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart.</span> The silliness of the dove, with which the stupidity of Ephraim is compared, is not manifested by its missing its nest and resting-place, and then helplessly fluttering about, according to Ewald; nor by its falling into the net of the bird-catcher in its effort to escape from the hawk, according to Hitzig; nor by its neither grieving nor searching for its young when it is robbed of them, according to Jerome; nor by its becoming dejected or devoid of consideration when it has lost its young, according to the Targum; but by its flying right into the net of the bird-catcher, without suspecting or observing it in its search for food, according to Rosenm&uuml;ller. Thus Kimchi explains it: "The prophet compares Ephraim to a dove which gets caught in a net owing to its simplicity, because it has no sense to perceive that, when it goes to gather grains of corn, a net is spread there to catch it. So Ephraim, when they went and asked help from Assyria or from Egypt, (did not perceive) that they went to their hurt, when they sought help from the foreign nations and not from God - blessed be he! - in whose hand all is. And he mentions the dove, though it is the manner of other birds, because the dove has no bitterness, as if it went in simplicity and without apprehension of the evil that would come upon it." <span class="cmt_word">They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</span> The position of Palestine exposed its inhabitants to attacks from the two great rival powers of Egypt and Assyria, or Babylon. "It stood midway," says Stanley, "between the two great seats of ancient empire, Babylon and Egypt. It was on the high-road from one to the other of these mighty powers, the prize for which they contended, the battlefield on which they fought, the lofty bridge over which they ascended and descended respectively into the deep basins of the Nile and Euphrates." Accordingly the rulers of the people sought help, now from Egypt to strengthen them against the oppression of Assyria; at another time they sought to secure the support of Assyria. The most powerful enemy of the northern kingdom was Assyria, which distressed that kingdom more and more, until at last they made an end of it. "But," says Kimchi, "while they think to obtain help by them (Egypt and Assyria), they fall into the net of the Almighty - blessed be he - and this is what he says (in the following verse). <span class="cmt_word">As they go I spread my net over them."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But only brief notices, characterizing its nature, were given regarding the Macedonian kingdom, which agree with the prophecies <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-5.htm">Daniel 8:5-8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21-22</a>, without adding new elements. The founder of the kingdom is called &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, "brave king," "hero-king," and his kingdom "a great dominion." Of his government it is said &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, he does, rules, according to his will (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-4.htm">Daniel 8:4</a>), so that his power might be characterized as irresistible and boundless self-will. Similarly Curtius writes of him (x. 5. 35): Fatendum est, cum plurimum virtuti debuerit, plus debuisse fortunae, quam solus omnium mortalium in potestate habuit. Hujus siquidem beneficio agere videbatur gentibus quidquid placebat. By the &#1499; in &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493; the coming of the king and the destruction of his kingdom are stated as synchronous, so as to express with great force the shortness of its duration. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493; is not to be otherwise interpreted than &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3</a>, and is thus not to be translated: "when he thus stands up," sc. in the regal power described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3</a> (Kran.), or: "on the pinnacle of his might" (Hv.), but: "when (or as) he has made his appearance, his kingdom shall be broken." In the words, also, there does not lie the idea "that he himself in his life-time is deprived of this throne and his kingdom by a violent catastrophe" (Kran.); for the destruction of the kingdom does not necessarily include in it the putting to death of the ruler. The thought is only this: "when he has appeared and founded a great dominion, his kingdom shall be immediately broken." &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512; (shall be broken) is chosen with reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>, "toward the four winds of heaven." We may neither supply &#1514;&#1495;&#1509; (shall be divided) to &#1500;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (and not to his posterity), nor is this latter expression "connected with &#1514;&#1495;&#1509; in pregnant construction;" for &#1514;&#1495;&#1509;, from &#1495;&#1510;&#1492;, signifies to divide, from which we are not to assume the idea of to allot, assign. We have simply to supply &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; in the sense of the verb. subst., shall be, as well here as in the following clause, &#1499;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;. The &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; e signifies here as little as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a>, posterity  equals  &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, but remnant, that which is left behind, the survivors of the king, by which we are to understand not merely his sons, but all the members of his family. &#1499;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, "and it shall not be according to the dominion which he ruled." This thought, corresponding to &#1489;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a>, is the natural conclusion from the idea of division to all the four winds, which the falling asunder into several or many small kingdoms involves. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;, "shall be plucked up" (of plants from the earth), denotes the rooting up of that which is table, the destroying and dissolving of the kingdom into portions. In this division it shall pass to others &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, "with the exclusion of those" (the &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;), the surviving members of the family of Alexander. To &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (and for others) supply &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; (shall be).<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>, accordingly, the prophetic thought is expressed, that the Javanic kingdom, as soon as the brave king has founded a great dominion, shall be broken to pieces and divided toward the four winds of heaven, so that its separate parts, without reaching to the might of the broken kingdom, shall be given not to the survivors of the family of the founder, but to strangers. This was historically fulfilled in the fact, that after the sudden death of Alexander his son Hercules was not recognised by his generals as successor on the throne, but was afterwards murdered by Polysperchon; his son also born by Roxana, along with his guardian Philip Arideus, met the same fate; but the generals, after they had at first divided the kingdom into more than thirty parts, soon began to war with each other, the result of which was, that at last four larger kingdoms were firmly established.
