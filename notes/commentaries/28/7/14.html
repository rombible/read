This rendering is supported by several eminent authorities. Others follow Ewald in translating,” they <span class= "ital">excite</span> themselves” with dervish-like devices and cries.

This is based on a slightly different reading, contained in some of Kennicott’s and De Rossi’s MSS., which is not improbably the right one. The charge is that all their simulated penitence is to secure physical comforts, not to show conformity with the Divine will.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:8-16 Israel was as a cake not turned, half burnt and half dough, none of it fit for use; a mixture of idolatry and of the worship of Jehovah. There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves. Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they have not cried unto him with their heart, when they howled upon their beds - Or, in the present time, "they cry not unto Me when they howl." They did "cry," and, it may be, they "cried" even "unto God." At least, the prophet does not deny that they cried to God at all; only, he says, that they did "not cry to" Him "with their heart." Their cries were wrung from them by their temporal distresses, and ended in them, not in God. There was no sincerity in their hearts, no change in their doings. Their cry was a mere howling. The secret complaint of the heart is a loud cry in the ears of God. The impetuous "cry" of impatient and unconverted suffering is a mere brutish "howling." Their heart was set wholly on their earthly needs; it did not thank God for giving them good things, nor cry to Him truly when He withheld them.<p>But, it may be, that the prophet means also to contrast the acts of the ungodly, private and public, amid distress, with those of the godly. The godly man implores God in public and in private. The prayer on the "bed," expresses the private prayer of the soul to God, when, the world being shut out, it is alone with Him. In place of this, there was the "howling," as people toss fretfully and angrily on their beds, roar for pain; but, instead of complaining "to" God, complain "of" Him, and are angry, not with themselves, but with God. In place of the public prayer and humiliation, there was a mere tumultuous assembly, in which they clamored "for grain and wine," and "rebelled against God. They assemble themselves;" (literally, "they  gather themselves tumultuously together). They rebel against Me ;" (literally, "they turn aside against Me"). They did not only (as it is expressed elsewhere) "turn aside "from" God." "They turn aside against Me," He says, flying, as it were, in the very face of God. This "tumultuous assembly" was either some stormy civil debate, how to obtain the grain and wine which God withheld, or a tumultuous clamoring to their idols and false gods, like that of the priests of Baal, when arrayed against Elijah on Mount Carmel; whereby they removed the further from God's law, and rebelled with a high hand against Him.<p>: What is to "cry to the Lord," but to long for the Lord? But if anyone multiply prayers, crying and weeping as he may, yet not with any intent to gain God Himself, but to obtain some earthly or passing thing, he cannot truly be said to "cry unto the Lord," i. e., so to cry that his cry should come to the hearing of the Lord. This is a cry like Esau's, who sought no other fruit from his father's blessing, save to be rich and powerful in this world. When then He saith, "They cried not to Me in their heart, etc.," He means, they were not devoted to Me, their heart was not right with Me; they sought not Myself, but things of Mine. They howled, desiring only things for the belly, and seeking not to have Me. Thus they belong not to "the generation of those who seek the Lord, who seek the face of the God of Jacob" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a>, but to the generation of Esau." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. not cried unto me&#8212;but unto other gods [Maurer], (Job 35:9, 10).

In their distress, indeed, they cried unto the Lord, and said they repented of their sins, and promised reformation, and made a show of worshipping God; as invocation is sometimes put for the whole worship of God; but then this was not heartily, but hypocritically; their hearts and their mouths did not go together, and therefore was not reckoned prayer; nothing but howling, as follows: <p>when they howled upon their beds; lying sick or wounded there; or, as some, in their idol temples, those beds of adultery, where they pretended to worship God by them, and to pray to him through them; but such idolatrous prayers were no better than the howlings of clogs to him; even though they expressed outwardly their cries with great vehemency, as the word used denotes, having one letter more in it than common: <p>they assemble themselves for corn and wine: either at their banquets, to feast upon them, as Aben Ezra; or to the markets, to buy them, as Kimchi suggests; or rather to their idol temples, to deprecate a famine, and to pray for rain and fruitful seasons; or if they gather together to pray to the Lord, it is only for carnal and worldly things; they only seek themselves, and their own interest, and not the glory of God, and ask for these things, to consume them on their lust. The Septuagint version is, "for corn and wine they were cut", or cut themselves, as Baal's priests did, when they cried to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>; and Theodoret here observes, that they performed the Heathen rites, and in idol temples made incisions on their bodies: <p>and they rebel against me: not only flee from him transgress his laws but cast off all allegiance to him and take up arms, and commit hostilities against him. The Targum joins this with the preceding clause, <p>"because of the multitude of corn and wine which they have gathered they have rebelled against my word;'' <p>and to the same sense Jarchi; thus, Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> when they howled upon their beds: <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> they assemble themselves for corn and wine, <i>and</i> they rebel against me.</span><p>(l) When they were in affliction, and cried out in pain, they did not seek me for help.<p>(m) They only seek their own benefit and wealth, and care not for me their God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">with their heart, when they howled</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">in their heart, but they howl</span>.

Their falsehood manifested itself in works as well as words; a practical example is here given. They did not, in reality, seek help from God; if they sought at all, it was insincerely. They cried to God, but that cry did not proceed from their heart. They gave vent to their feelings of distress by howlings upon their beds; but those howlings were the expression of unbelief and despair, not by any means evidences of faith. "They do not cry to me," says Aben Ezra, "as the sick man cries to the physician." The comment of Kimchi is still fuller and more explicit: "They have not cried to me in their heart, because of their notion that I do not see their cry nor know what is good or bad for them; but they howl upon their beds, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when they are upon their bed and when they think of that misfortune which is coming upon them.

His derivation from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, God, as if a cry to him for help, is incorrect; it is really an onomatopoetic word. <span class="cmt_word">They assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.</span> What this <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> assembling of themselves was does not clearly appear; whether it was in the market-place or elsewhere to purchase corn in time of famine, as some think; or in idol-temples to propitiate their deities, like the Roman <span class="accented">supplicatio</span> or <span class="accented">lectiosternium</span>, <span class="accented">as others</span> suppose; or for the performance of some extra rite of worship to Jehovah; or for the purpose of plunder in a season of scarcity; or generally their assembling in knots and crowds to discuss anxiously and lament despairingly the distressed state of the country; - their chief design and highest aim being a good supply of corn and wine, that is, the supply of mere bodily wants. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span>, as their rendering is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, equivalent to "they cut themselves," or" pined for corn and wine;" corresponding to which rendering is Cyril's exposition: "As enthusiasts and fanatics making incisions with steel in their breasts and both hands, and absurdly all but shedding in sacrifice their own blood, perhaps to graven images." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jerome, taking the verb from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to ruminate, translates accordingly: "super triticum et vinum ruminabant." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The Syriac, tracing it to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to be afraid, translates: "They feared (or, were fearfully anxious) about corn and wine." The common reading and rendering are clearly preferable; Kimchi's exposition is in harmony therewith: "When corn or new wine comes into the city for sale, they all assemble at (or, round) it on account of the famine which is in the city; and yet they fall away from me." The construction of the last clause is pregnant, that is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "they turn aside (and turn) against me."
