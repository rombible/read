There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves.

All the afflictions of God humbled him not; yea, they but brought out his pride, which "kept him from acknowledging and repenting of the sins which had brought those evils upon him, and from "turning to God and seeking to Him" for remedy" . People complain of their "fortune" or "fate" or "stars," and go on the more obstinately, to build up what God destroys, to prop up by human means or human aid what, by God's providence, is failing; they venture more desperately, in order to recover past losses, until the crash at last becomes hopeless and final.<p>Nor seek Him for all this - God had exhausted all the treasures of His severity, as, before, of His love. He Himself marvels at His incorrigible and contumacious servant, as He says in Isaiah, "Why should ye be stricken anymore? Ye will revolt more and more" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>. How is this?

See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>; notwithstanding their weak and declining state, they were proud and haughty; entertained a high conceit of themselves, and of their good and safe condition; and behaved insolently towards God, and were not humbled before him for their sins. Their pride was notorious, which they themselves could not deny; they were self-convicted, and self-condemned: <p>and they do not return to the Lord their God; by acknowledgment of their sins, repentance for them, and reformation from them; and by attendance on his worship, from which they had revolted; so the Targum, <p>"they return not to the worship of the Lord their God:'' <p>nor seek him for all this; though they are in this wasting, declining, condition, and just upon the brink of ruin, yet they seek not the face and favour of the Lord; they do not ask help of him, or implore his mercy; and though they have been so long in these circumstances, and have been gradually consuming for many years, yet in all this time they have made no application to the Lord, that he would be favourable, and raise their sinking state, and restore them to their former glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">And the pride of Israel</span> …] Repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm" title="And the pride of Israel does testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.">Hosea 5:5</a>, just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-9.htm" title="And I that am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt will yet make you to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.">Hosea 12:9</a> <span class="ital">a</span> is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-4.htm" title="Yet I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt, and you shall know no god but me: for there is no savior beside me.">Hosea 13:4</a> <span class="ital">a</span>. It is not the prophet who speaks condemning a bad quality in his people, but Jehovah, Israel’s true Pride, and the source of Israel’s prosperity, who utters a solemn word of warning translated into act.

If with Keil and others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we understand "the pride of Israel" to mean Jehovah the glory of Israel, and take the verb in the sense of "testify," the meaning will be that Jehovah bore witness to the face of Israel by the weakening and wasting of their kingdom, as portrayed in the preceding verse. We prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to understand "the pride of Israel" in the souse of "the haughtiness" of Israel, and the verb in the sense of "being humbled," as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>. The real meaning, then, is expressed in the following rendering: <span class="accented">And the haughtiness of Israel shall be humbled to his face</span>. This humiliation is the effect of the wasting mentioned in the preceding verse; while the evidence of their humiliation is specified in the succeeding verse by their resorting to Egypt and repairing to Assyria from a consciousness of their helplessness. This rendering is countenanced by the LXX., both here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>; while Rashi says, "The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d2;&#x5d4;</span> has the meaning of "humiliation." <span class="accented">For all this</span>. This emphasizes the obstinate blindness and perverseness of Ephraim, when, amid all the calamities and miseries of the kingdom both within and without, they turned not to Jehovah to solicit help and deliverance, but concluded treaties or made alliances with foreign nations in hope of being lifted up out of their national impotence. On this Aben Ezra makes the judicious remark: "They turned not to Jehovah as paupers who have nothing more to give foreign nations that they may help them." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But only brief notices, characterizing its nature, were given regarding the Macedonian kingdom, which agree with the prophecies <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-5.htm">Daniel 8:5-8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21-22</a>, without adding new elements. The founder of the kingdom is called &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, "brave king," "hero-king," and his kingdom "a great dominion." Of his government it is said &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, he does, rules, according to his will (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-4.htm">Daniel 8:4</a>), so that his power might be characterized as irresistible and boundless self-will. Similarly Curtius writes of him (x. 5. 35): Fatendum est, cum plurimum virtuti debuerit, plus debuisse fortunae, quam solus omnium mortalium in potestate habuit. Hujus siquidem beneficio agere videbatur gentibus quidquid placebat. By the &#1499; in &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493; the coming of the king and the destruction of his kingdom are stated as synchronous, so as to express with great force the shortness of its duration. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493; is not to be otherwise interpreted than &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3</a>, and is thus not to be translated: "when he thus stands up," sc. in the regal power described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3</a> (Kran.), or: "on the pinnacle of his might" (Hv.), but: "when (or as) he has made his appearance, his kingdom shall be broken." In the words, also, there does not lie the idea "that he himself in his life-time is deprived of this throne and his kingdom by a violent catastrophe" (Kran.); for the destruction of the kingdom does not necessarily include in it the putting to death of the ruler. The thought is only this: "when he has appeared and founded a great dominion, his kingdom shall be immediately broken." &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512; (shall be broken) is chosen with reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>, "toward the four winds of heaven." We may neither supply &#1514;&#1495;&#1509; (shall be divided) to &#1500;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (and not to his posterity), nor is this latter expression "connected with &#1514;&#1495;&#1509; in pregnant construction;" for &#1514;&#1495;&#1509;, from &#1495;&#1510;&#1492;, signifies to divide, from which we are not to assume the idea of to allot, assign. We have simply to supply &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; in the sense of the verb. subst., shall be, as well here as in the following clause, &#1499;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;. The &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; e signifies here as little as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a>, posterity  equals  &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, but remnant, that which is left behind, the survivors of the king, by which we are to understand not merely his sons, but all the members of his family. &#1499;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, "and it shall not be according to the dominion which he ruled." This thought, corresponding to &#1489;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a>, is the natural conclusion from the idea of division to all the four winds, which the falling asunder into several or many small kingdoms involves. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;, "shall be plucked up" (of plants from the earth), denotes the rooting up of that which is table, the destroying and dissolving of the kingdom into portions. In this division it shall pass to others &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, "with the exclusion of those" (the &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;), the surviving members of the family of Alexander. To &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (and for others) supply &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; (shall be).<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>, accordingly, the prophetic thought is expressed, that the Javanic kingdom, as soon as the brave king has founded a great dominion, shall be broken to pieces and divided toward the four winds of heaven, so that its separate parts, without reaching to the might of the broken kingdom, shall be given not to the survivors of the family of the founder, but to strangers. This was historically fulfilled in the fact, that after the sudden death of Alexander his son Hercules was not recognised by his generals as successor on the throne, but was afterwards murdered by Polysperchon; his son also born by Roxana, along with his guardian Philip Arideus, met the same fate; but the generals, after they had at first divided the kingdom into more than thirty parts, soon began to war with each other, the result of which was, that at last four larger kingdoms were firmly established.
