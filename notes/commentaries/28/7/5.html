(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm" title="For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.">Acts 2:15</a>.) There is bitterness in the use of the pronoun “our” before “king.” Otherwise we must render, <span class= "ital">have made themselves ill with the fever of wine</span> (the Authorised version is here inaccurate). The last clause is obscure; probably it means “he (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> our king) hath made common cause with scorners,” and is boon-companion of the dissolute and depraved.

Some recent and notorious act of contempt to God, or to his prophets, or to public justice, is here alluded to. “Those,” says Bishop Horsley, “who in their cups made a jest of the true religion, and derided the denunciations of God’s prophets, the king distinguished with the most familiar marks of his royal favour; in this way carrying on the plot of delusion.” <span class="ital">They — </span>Those luxurious and drunken princes; <span class="ital">have made ready their heart like an oven — </span>Hot with concupiscence, ambition, revenge, and covetousness. <span class="ital">While they lie in wait</span> — Against the life or estate of some of their subjects. <span class="ital">Their baker sleepeth,</span> &c. — As a baker, having kindled a fire in his oven, goes to bed and sleeps all night, and in the morning finds his oven well heated, and ready for his purpose; so these, when they have laid some wicked plot, though they may seem to sleep for a while, yet the fire is glowing within, and flames out as soon as ever there is opportunity for it. <span class="ital">They are all hot as an oven — </span>The whole people are inflamed with bad passions, and have followed the ill example of their princes and great men. Or, the flame of civil discord is spread among the people in general; and, as fire devours, so has this destroyed their judges and rulers by conspiracies and assassinations. <span class="ital">All their kings are fallen — </span>An anarchy continued for eleven years after the death of Jeroboam II., and the six following kings, the last who reigned in Israel, fell by conspirators, namely, Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah, Pekah, and Hoshea. <span class="ital">There is none among them that calleth unto me — </span>And yet these plain signs of my indignation have not brought either kings or people to a due humiliation and sorrow for their sins.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 A practical disbelief of God's government was at the bottom of all israel's wickedness; as if God could not see it or did not heed it. Their sins appear on every side of them. Their hearts were inflamed by evil desires, like a heated oven. In the midst of their troubles as a nation, the people never thought of seeking help from God. The actual wickedness of men's lives bears a very small proportion to what is in their hearts. But when lust is inwardly cherished, it will break forth into outward sin. Those who tempt others to drunkenness never can be their real friends, and often design their ruin. Thus men execute the Divine vengeance on each other. Those are not only heated with sin, but hardened in sin, who continue to live without prayer, even when in trouble and distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the day of our king, the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine - (Or, "with heat from wine.") Their holydays, like those of so many Englishmen now, were days of excess. "The day of their king" was probably some civil festival; his birthday, or his coronation-day. The prophet owns the king, in that he calls him "our king;" he does not blame them for keeping the day, but for the way in which they kept it. Their festival they turned into an irreligious and anti-religious carousal; making themselves like "the brutes which perish," and tempting their king first to forget his royal dignity, and then to blaspheme the majesty of God.<p>He stretched out his hand with scorners - as it is said,  "Wine is a mocker" (or "scoffer"). Drunkenness, by taking off all power of self restraint, brings out the evil which is in the man. The "scorner" or "scoffer" is one who "neither fears God nor regards man" <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-4.htm">Luke 18:4</a>, but makes a jest of all things, true and good, human or divine. Such were these corrupt princes of the king of Israel; with these "he stretched out the hand," in token of his good fellowship with them, and that he was one with them. He withdrew his hand or his society from good and sober people, and "stretched" it "out," not to punish these, but to join with them, as people in drink reach out their hands to any whom they meet, in token of their sottish would-be friendliness. With these the king drank, jested, played the buffoon, praised his idols, scoffed at God. The flattery of the bad is a man's worst foe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the day of our king&#8212;his birthday or day of inauguration.<p>have made him sick&#8212;namely, the king.

The meaning is given by Kimchi in the following comment: "The sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span> is that the one came with his bottle full of wine, and the other with his bottle; and they made the king sick;" and to this there is an exact parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>, "Woe unto him that giveth his neigh-hour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also." In the second clause the expression, "drawing out the hand," is borrowed from drunken carousals, in which the hand is stretched out in asking, receiving, and handing the goblets; or, more simply, according to Pussy, who says, "Men in drink reach out their hands to any whom they meet, in token of their sottish would be friendliness." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Therefore he may not talk with this Lord, i.e., with Him who appeared before him in such dread majesty; and he is yet in such a state, since all strength has departed from him and his breath has gone, that he fears he must die; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17</a>.

From this it does not follow that he who spoke to him touched him, but only that it was a spiritual being, who appeared like to a man. After thus being touched for the third time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>), the encouragement of the angel that talked with him imparted to him full strength, so that he could calmly listen to and observe his communication. </body></html>
