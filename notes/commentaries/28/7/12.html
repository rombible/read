There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves. Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When they go - (Literally, "according as" they go, in all circumstances of time or place or manner, when whithersoever or howsoever they shall go,) I "will spread My net upon them," so as to surround and envelop them on all sides and hold them down. The "dove" soaring aloft, with speed like the storm-wind <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-6.htm">Psalm 55:6-8</a>, is a picture of freedom, independence, impetuous, unhindered, following on its own course; weak and timid, it trusts in the skillfulness with which it guides its flight, to escape pursuit; the "net," with its thin slight meshes, betokens how weak instruments become all-sufficient in the hands of the Almighty; the same dove, brought down from its almost viewless height, fluttering weakly, helplessly and hopelessly, under those same meshes, is a picture of that same self-dependent spirit humiliated, overwhelmed by inevitable evils, against which it impotently struggles, from which it seems to see its escape, but by which it is held as fast, as if it lay motionless in iron.<p>As their congregation hath heard - Manifoldly had the message of reward on obedience, and of punishment on disobedience, come to Israel. It was spread throughout the law; it fills the book of Deuteronomy; it was concentrated in the blessing and the curse on mount Ebal and Gerizim; it was put into their mouths in the song of Moses; it was inculcated by all the prophets who had already prophesied to them, and now it was being enforced on that generation by Hosea himself. Other kingdoms have fallen; but their fall, apart from Scripture, has not been the subject of prophecy. Their ruin has come mostly unexpected, either by themselves or others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

He begins by the application of the comparison of Ephraim to a dove. Exactly as a dove in its silliness falls into the net set by the fowler, so Israel runs into the net of destruction in seeking help from Egypt and Assyria. The literal rendering is, according <span class="accented">as they go</span>, or, <span class="accented">whatsoever way they shall go</span>. God threatens to spread a net over them, from which there can be no escape. The chief aim of Hebrew sovereigns and rulers was to defend themselves from Egypt by the help of Assyria, or from Assyria by the aid of Egypt; in either case God threatens to spread over them the net of destruction as the bird-catcher. The application to one or other of these powers God forbade, but when they go to either for relief, the result is sure to prove fatal. The image of a net is frequent in Ezekiel; so in Job, he "hath compassed me with his net." <span class="cmt_word">I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven</span>. The comparison with birds and bird-catching continues. Though their sunward soaring flight be high as the eagle's, or rapid as the soft swift wing of the dove, they cannot outspeed or escape the hand of God, but shall be brought down to earth. Or the idea may be that, swiftly as a bird of prey swoops down out of the free air of heaven upon its quarry on the low-lying earth, Jehovah will bring Israel down out of the air of freedom into the net of captivity. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a> we read, "Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord;" likewise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2</a>, "Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down." <span class="cmt_word">I will chastise them as their congregation hath heard.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> is an anomalous Hiph. instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, that is, <span class="accented">yod</span> mobile instead of <span class="accented">yod</span> quiescent or diphthongal <span class="accented">zere</span>. The literal rendering makes the meaning more obvious; it is: "I will chastise them according to the tidings [or,' announcement '] to their congregation." In the Law and by the prophets it was repeatedly declared that judgments would fall upon the disobedient and rebellions. As specimens of such announcements, we may refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15-35</a> The prophet now assures Ephraim that the judgments so frequently and forcibly announced to the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness, and repeated in subsequent times by the prophets, would be executed on the rebellious rigorously, and in exact accordance with those many previous denunciations. Kimchi has the following comment: "I will assemble them through the chastisement of the peoples, as I announced to their assembly in the wilderness words of chastisement, which are written in the Law, if they will not hearken to the words of the Law." The LXX. may have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span>, as their rendering is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "'I will chasten them <span class="accented">with the</span> rumor <span class="accented">of their</span> (coming) <span class="accented">affliction</span>," <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From the 5th verse the prophecy passes to the wars of the kings of the south and the north for the supremacy and for the dominion over the Holy Land, which lay between the two. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5</a> describes the growing strength of these two kings, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-6.htm">Daniel 11:6</a> an attempt made by them to join themselves together. &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;, to become strong. The king of the south is the ruler of Egypt; this appears from the context, and is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-8.htm">Daniel 11:8</a>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503; is differently interpreted; &#1502;&#1503;, however, is unanimously regarded as a partitive: "one of his princes," as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-28.htm">Nehemiah 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>. The suffix to &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; (his princes) does not (with C. B. Michaelis, Bertholdt, Rosenmller, and Kranichfeld) refer to &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3</a>, because this noun is too far removed, and then also &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; must be referred to it; but thereby the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5</a>, that one of the princes of the king of Javan would gain greater power and dominion than the valiant king had, would contradict the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>, that no one of the Diadochs would attain to the dominion of Alexander.<p>(Note: This contradiction is not set aside, but only strengthened, by translating &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; "he overcame him" (Kran.), according to which the king of Javan must be thought of as overcome by one of his princes, the king of the south. For the thought that the king of Javan survived the destruction of his kingdom, and that, after one of his princes had become the king of the south and had founded a great dominion, he was overcome by him, contradicts too strongly the statement of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5</a>, that the kingdom of the valiant king of Javan would be destroyed, and that it would not fall to his survivors, but to others with the exception of those, for one to be able to interpret the words in this sense.)<p>The suffix to &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; can only be referred to the immediately preceding &#1492;&#1504;&#1490;&#1489; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;: "one of the princes of the king of the south." But then  &#1493;in &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503; cannot be explicative, but is only the simple copula. This interpretation also is not opposed by the Atnach under &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, for this accent is added to the subject because it stands before separately, and is again resumed in &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; by the copula ,&#1493; as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-19.htm">Ezekiel 34:19</a>. The thought is this: one of the princes of the king of the south shall attain to greater power than this king, and shall found a great dominion. That this prince is the king of the north, or founds a dominion in the north, is not expressly said, but is gathered from <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-6.htm">Daniel 11:6</a>, where the king of the south enters into a league with the king of the north. </body></html>
