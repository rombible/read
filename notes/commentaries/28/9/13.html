They render “Ephraim, even as I saw, gave their children for a prey.” The reference to Tyre is very obscure. Some would render the Hebrew word for “meadow” by “resting-place,” and interpret, “I look on Ephraim even as I look on Tyre, planted in a sure resting-place.” The impregnable fortress of Tyre was a conspicuous object in the days of Hosea. Similarly Samaria was a stronghold which was able <span class= "ital">to</span> resist prolonged sieges. (Comp. Isaiah’s graphic words: <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/28-1.htm" title="Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!">Isaiah 28:1-4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm" title="Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!">Amos 6:1</a>)—“<span class= "ital">Yet</span> Ephraim shall bring forth sons to the murderer,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the impending overthrow and massacre, 721 B.C.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:11-17. God departs from a people, or from a person, when he withdraws his goodness and mercy from them; and when the Lord is departed, what can the creature do? Even though, for the present, good things seem to remain, yet the blessing is gone if God is gone. Even the children should perish with the parents. The Divine wrath dries up the root, and withers the fruit of all comforts; and the scattered Jews daily warn us to beware, lest we neglect or abuse the gospel. Yet every smiting is not a drying up of the root. It may be that God intends only to smite so that the sap may be turned to the root, that there may be more of root graces, more humility, patience, faith, and self-denial. It is very just that God should bring judgments on those who slight his offered mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place - Or (better) "as I saw (her) toward Tyre," or "as I saw as to Tyre." Ephraim stretched out, in her dependent tribes, "toward" or "to" Tyre itself. Like to Tyrus she was, "in her riches, her glory, her pleasantness, her strength, her pride," and in the end, her fall. The picture is that of a fair tree, not chance-sown, but "planted" carefully by hand in a pleasant place. Beauty and strength were blended in her. On the tribe of Joseph especially, Moses had pronounced the blessing; "Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep which coucheth beneath, and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moons (i. e., month by month) and for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills and for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, and for the good pleasure of Him who dwelt in the bush" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-16</a>. Beautiful are the mountains of Ephraim, and the rich valleys or plains which break them. And chief in beauty and in strength was the valley, whose central hill its capital, Samaria, crowned; "the crown of pride to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower which is on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>. The blessing of Moses pointed perhaps to the time when Shiloh was the tabernacle of Him, who once dwelt and revealed Himself in the bush. Now that it had exchanged its God for the calves, the blessings which it still retained, stood but in the more awful contrast with its future.<p>But Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer - Literally, "and Ephraim is to bring forth etc." i. e., proud though her wealth, and high her state, pleasantly situated and firmly rooted, one thing lay before her, one destiny, she "was to bring forth children only for the murderer." Childlessness in God's providence is the appropriate and frequent punishment of sins of the flesh. Pride too brought Peninnah, the adversary of Hannah, low, even as to that which was the ground of her pride, her children. "The barren hath born seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>. So as to the soul, "pride deprives of grace." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

That is, either as the city of Tyre, a very famous city in Phoenicia, was situated in a very pleasant place by the sea, and abounded in wealth and riches, and was well fortified, and seemed secure from all danger, and from all enemies; so Ephraim or the ten tribes, the kingdom of Israel, were in like circumstances, equal to Tyre, as the Targum paraphrases it, in prosperity and plenty; yet as the prophet in the vision of prophecy saw that Tyre, notwithstanding all its advantages by power and wealth, by art and nature, would be destroyed, first by Nebuchadnezzar, and then by Alexander; so by the same prophetic spirit he saw that Ephraim or the ten tribes, notwithstanding their present prosperity, and the safety and security they thought themselves in, yet should be given up to ruin and destruction by the hand of the Assyrians; or it may be rendered thus, "Ephraim as", or "when I saw it, unto Tyre" (k); reaching unto that place, and bordering upon it, as part of the ten tribes did; I saw it, I observed it, took a survey of it, and I perceived it was "planted in a pleasant place"; like a tree planted in a fruitful soil, well rooted, and in a flourishing condition; so were they, abounding with all good things, and having a numerous offspring; from all which they promised themselves much happiness for ages to come: <p>but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer; to sacrifice them to Mo, as some; so the Targum, <p>"they of the house of Ephraim have sinned in slaying their children to the service of idols;'' <p>with which Jarchi agrees; but rather the sense is, with Kimchi, and others, when their enemies shall come against them, as the Assyrian army, they shall go out with their sons to fight with them, and these shall be destroyed and murdered by them; it will be like leading lambs to the slaughter to be butchered and devoured by them. <p>(k)   "quando vidi usque ad Tyrum", Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ephraim, as I saw <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> Tyrus, <i>is</i> planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.</span><p>(o) As they kept tender plants in their houses in Tyrus to preserve them from the cold air of the sea, so was Ephraim at the first to me: but now I will give him to the slaughter.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus</span>, &c.] The passage is most obscure, and it is difficult to believe that Hosea meant what A.V. supposes. ‘As I look at Tyre’, would be better; but then it becomes difficult to extract a sense. Tyre is, in fact, very much out of place in a description of the fortunes of Ephraim; and it is a relief to find that it has been introduced by critics contrary to Hebrew usage, for Tyre is elsewhere spelt without a <span class="ital">Vâv</span>. How, too, can Ephraim be said to be planted, without any explanatory figurative words? The Sept. seems to have had a different text, ‘As for Ephraim, according as I see, they have set their sons for a prey’; and this seems preferable to the received text. The prophet sees in imagination the Ephraimites taken like wild beasts, and put to death by their cruel captors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but Ephraim shall</span>, &c.] Taking the passage as a contrast between Ephraim’s past glory and the dreadful fate impending over it.

He shall raise himself above every god, not merely "subjectively in his lofty imagination" (Hitzig), but also by his actions. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, every god, not merely the God of Israel, but also the gods of the heathen. This does not agree with Antiochus. The &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; which is said of him, 2 Macc. 9:12, is not an exalting of himself above every god. "Antiochus was not an &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; he even wished to render the worship of Zeus universal; and that he once spoiled the temple does not imply his raising himself above every god" (Klief.). Of Antiochus much rather, as is said by Livy (41:20), in duabus tamen magnis honestisque rebus fere regius erat animus, in urbium donis et deorum cultu. On the contrary, these words before us are expressly referred to Antichrist, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>.<p>Yet further, in his arrogance he shall speak &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, wonderful, i.e., impious and astonishing things, against the God of gods, i.e., the true God. This clause expounds and strengthens the &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1512;&#1489;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503; (speaking great things), which is said of the enemy at the time of the end, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-11.htm">Daniel 7:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm">Daniel 7:20</a>. In this he will prosper, but only till the anger of God against His people (&#1494;&#1506;&#1501; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>) shall be accomplished. Regarding &#1499;&#1500;&#1492; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>. This anger of God is irrevocably determined (&#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;), that His people may be wholly purified for the consummation of His kingdom in glory. The perf. &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1492; does not stand for the imperf. because it is decreed, but in its proper meaning, according to which it represents the matter as finished, settled. Here it accordingly means: "for that which is irrevocably decreed is accomplished, is not to be recalled, but must be done." </body></html>
