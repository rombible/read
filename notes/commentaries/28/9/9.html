The people were become as corrupt as those of Gibeah, Jud 19; and their crimes should be visited in like manner. At first God had found Israel pleasing to Him, as grapes to the traveller in the wilderness. He saw them with pleasure as the first ripe figs. This shows the delight God took in them; yet they followed after idolatry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They have deeply corrupted themselves - Literally, "they have gone deep, they are corrupted." They have deeply immersed themselves in wickedness; have gone to the greatest depth they could, in it; they are sunk in it, so that they could hardly be extricated from it; and this, of their own deliberate intent; they contrived it deeply, hiding themselves, as they hoped, from God.<p>As in, the days of Gibeah - When Benjamin espoused the cause of "the children of Belial" who had worked such horrible brutishness in Gibeah toward the concubine of the Levite. This they maintained with such obstinacy, that, through God's judgment, the whole tribe perished, except six hundred men. Deeply they must have already corrupted themselves, who supported such guilt. Such corruption and such obstinacy was their's still.<p>Therefore "he will remember their iniquity." God seemed for a time, as if He overlooked the guilt of Benjamin in the days of Gibeah, for at first He allowed them to be even victorious over Israel, yet in the end, they were punished, almost to extermination, and Gibeah was destroyed. So now, although He bore long with Ephraim, He would, in the end show that He remembered all by visiting all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. as in the days of Gibeah&#8212;as in the day of the perpetration of the atrocity of Gibeah, narrated in Jud 19:16-22, &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hosea/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They, </span> the people of the ten tribes, prophets, priests, princes, and people, have deeply corrupted themselves, have strangely and horribly debauched one another; beside all their idolatry, there is more than brutish filthiness among them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As in the days of Gibeah; </span> the story whereof you have <span class="bld">Judges 19</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore he, </span> God, who hateth such workers of iniquity, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">will remember their iniquity; </span> he will not pardon their iniquity, but charge it upon them: when God saith he will not remember, it is a promise of pardon; When he threatens he will remember, it is a threat of not pardoning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He will visit their sins; </span> he will punish: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm" title="The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of your iniquity, and the great hatred.">Hosea 9:7</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hosea/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah,.... Not the false prophets and watchmen only; but rather Ephraim, or the ten tribes, through their means became extremely corrupt in principle and practice; they had most sadly degenerated, and were deeply sunk and immersed in all manner of wickedness, and rooted in it, and continued obstinate and incorrigible, so that there was no hope of reformation among them; they had got to as great a pitch of wickedness, and were guilty of the like uncleanness, lewdness, barbarity, and cruelty, as were acted by the men of Gibeah, with respect to the Levite and his concubine, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-1.htm">Judges 19:1</a>; for Gibeah of Benjamin is here meant, where the people asked a king, and rebelled against the words of the prophet, as some in Jarchi interpret it: <p>therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins: that is, God, my God, as the prophet calls him in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-8.htm">Hosea 9:8</a>, will not forgive and forget their sins; pardon being often expressed by a non-remembrance of sins; but will make inquiry after them, and visit them in a way of wrath and vengeance, and punish for them as they deserve: they being obstinate and impenitent, and persisting in their sins, like the men of Gibeah and Benjamin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> have deeply corrupted <i>themselves</i>, as in the days of Gibeah: <i>therefore</i> he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</span><p>(k) This people is so rooted in their wickedness, that Gibeah, which was similar to Sodom, was never more corrupt; Jud 19:22.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">as in the days of Gibeah</span>] The atrocity described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/19-22.htm" title="Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him....">Jdg 19:22-30</a>, and referred to by Hosea again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-9.htm" title="O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.">Hosea 10:9</a>.

This is in general the import of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-32.htm">Daniel 11:32</a>, the first half of which, however, has been very differently interpreted. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497; signifies neither "those who sinfully make a covenant" (Hvernick), nor "sinners among the covenant people" (v. Lengerke), nor "those who condemn the covenant," i.e., those who reject the sign of the covenant, circumcision (Hitzig). The latter meaning is altogether arbitrary. Against the second is the fact that &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is in use for sinners; against the first, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; could only mean: "to declare the covenant punishable." &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; means to act wickedly, to sin, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; can only be the accusative of reference, which is subordinated to the participle for the purpose of limitation (Ewald, 288); literally, "the acting wickedly with reference to the covenant." The absence of the article in &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is no proof against he reference of the word to the holy covenant. The article is wanting in Daniel where otherwise the determination is found from the connection, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>. Sinning against the covenant is, it is true, a stronger expression than &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; (to forsake the covenant), but it does not include the idea of the entire apostasy from God, but only insolent violation of the covenant law, so that of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497; it can very well be predicated &#1497;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;. &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507; does not mean to pollute (Kran.), but to desecrate, to make profane; and spoken of persons, to make them as heathen, as frequently in the Syriac. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, flatteries, here deceitful promises of earthly advantage; cf. under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>. For the subject spoken of here, see 1 Macc. 2:18. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; are the true confessors of the Lord. The suffix to &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; is neither to be interpreted distributively nor to be referred to &#1506;&#1501;. To &#1497;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; we are to supply &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; from the context: "to hold fast to the covenant." &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-17.htm">Daniel 11:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>, to carry out the design.
