What they sow has no stalk, no blade, or, if it have, the bud shall yield no fruit, there was nothing in them. The works of darkness are unfruitful; nay, the end of those things is death. The hopes of sinners will deceive them, and their gains will be snares. In times of danger, especially in the day of judgment, all carnal devices will fail. They take a course by themselves, and like a wild ass by himself, they will be the easier and surer prey for the lion. Man is in nothing more like the wild ass's colt, than in seeking for that succour and that satisfaction in the creature, which are to be had in God only.

In turn, the prophet says, the "calf," which he had chosen to be his god instead of the Lord his God, "has cast" him "off." He repeats the word, by which he had described Israel's sin, "Israel hath cast off and abhorred good" in order to show the connection of his sin and its punishment. "Thy calf," whom thou madest for thyself, whom thou worshipest, whom thou lovest, of whom thou saidst, "Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-31</a>; "thy" calf, in whom thou didst trust instead of thy God, it has requited thee the dishonor thou didst put on thy God; it hath "cast thee off" as a thing "abhorred." So it is with all people's idols, which they make to themselves, instead of God. First or last, they all fail a man, and leave him poor indeed. Beauty fades; wealth fails; honor is transferred to another; nothing abides, save God. Whence our own great poet of nature makes a fallen favorite say, "had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal I served my king, He would not in mine age have left me naked to mine-enemies."<p>Mine anger is kindled against them - Our passions are but some distorted likeness of what exists in God without passion; our anger, of His displeasure against sin. And so God speaks to us after the manner of people, and pictures His divine displeasure under the likeness of our human passions of anger and fury, in order to bring home to us, what we wish to hide from ourselves, the severe and awful side of His Being, His Infinite Holiness, and the truth, that He will indeed avenge. He tells us, that He will surely punish; as people, who are extremely incensed, execute their displeasure if they can.<p>How long will it be ere they attain to innocency? - Literally, "how long will they not be able innocency?" So again it is said, "him that hath an high look and a proud heart, I cannot" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a>; we supply, "suffer." "New moons and sabbaths I cannot" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>; our version adds, "away with," i. e., endure. So here probably. As they had with abhorrence cast off God their good, so God says, "they cannot endure innocency;" but He speaks as wondering and aggrieved at their hardness of heart and their obdurate holding out against the goodness, which He desired for them. "How long will they not be able to endure innocency?" "What madness this, that when I give them place for repentence, they will not endure to return to health of soul!" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. hath cast thee off&#8212;As the ellipsis of thee is unusual, Maurer translates, "thy calf is abominable." But the antithesis to Ho 8:3 establishes English Version, "Israel hath cast off the thing that is good"; therefore, in just retribution, "thy calf hath cast thee off," that is, is made by God the cause of thy being cast off (Ho 10:15). Jeroboam, during his sojourn in Egypt, saw Apis worshipped at Memphis, and Mnevis at Heliopolis, in the form of an ox; this, and the temple cherubim, suggested the idea of the calves set up at Dan and Beth-el.<p>how long &#8230; ere they attain to innocency?&#8212;How long will they be incapable of bearing innocency?

The calf then here is the chief idol set up in Samaria, and worshipped there.

Or, is the cause of thy being cast off by the Lord, and of being cast out of thine own land, and carried captive into another; the past tense is used for the future, as is common in prophetic writings, to denote the certainty of the thing: or "thy calf hath left thee" (a); in the lurch; it cannot help thee; it is gone off, and forsaken thee; it has "removed" itself from thee, according to the sense of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-17.htm">Lamentations 3:17</a>; as Kimchi and Ben Melech observe; or is removed far from thee, being carried captive itself into Assyria; for, when the king of Assyria took Samaria, he seized on the golden calf for the sake of the gold, and took it away; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>; or "he hath removed thy calf" (b); that is, the enemy, taking it away when he took the city; or God has rejected it with the utmost contempt and abhorrence: the calf is here, and in the following verse, called the calf of Samaria, because this was the metropolis of the ten tribes, in which the calf was worshipped, and because it was worshipped by the Samaritans; and it may be, when Samaria became the chief city, the calf at Bethel might be removed thither, or another set up in that city: <p>mine anger is kindled against them: the calves at Dan and Bethel, the singular before being put for the plural; or against the if of Samaria, and Samaria itself; or the inhabitants of it, because of the worship of the calf, which was highly provoking to God, it being a robbing him of his glory, and giving it to graven images: <p>how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? or "purity" (c); of worship, life, and conversation: the words may be rendered thus, "how long?" (d) for there is a large stop there; and this may be a question of the prophet's, asking how long the wrath of God would burn against the people, what; would be the duration of it, and when it would end? to which an answer is returned, as the words may be translated, "they cannot bear purity" (e); of doctrine, of worship of heart, and life; when they can, mine anger will cease burning: or, as the Targum, <p>"as long as they cannot purify themselves,'' <p>or be purified; so long as they continue in their sins, in their superstition and idolatry, and other impieties, and are not purged from them. <p>(a)  "dereliquit vitulus te", Lutherus; "descruit te vitulus tuus", Schmidt.

The meaning of (b) is plain, the import being that the idol-worship had led to the rejection and so the withdrawal of Jehovah; while the sense of (a) conveys the idea that the golden calf which the country represented by its capital and the government had established at Bethel as the symbol of their worship, so far from protecting its worshippers, would fall itself into the hands of the Assyrian invader. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Septuagint translates by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, equivalent to "Cast off [as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>] thy calf, O Samaria;" which is  an exhortation to Samaria, and not only Samaria, but the entire country, with the inhabitants of the capital at its head, to cast aside the calf-worship by which they had incurred the wrath of the Almighty. Jerome, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5bb;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (Pual), renders, "Cast off is thy calf." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Some modern scholars translate, "He has cast off thy calf," and refer it to the enemy, and rather in the sense of carrying off the golden image as a spoil; or to Jehovah; thus De Wette has, "[Jehova] verwirft deiu Calb, Samarien," which is not in keeping with the first person in the next clause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Others take the verb intransitively, and give it the meaning of "smelling bodily," "emitting intolerable stench." "being loathsome or disgusting;" thus Keil has, "Thy calf disgusts, O Samaria." So Wunsche: "Anekolt deiu Calb." Israel loathed or felt disgust at pure worship and what was really good; now Jehovah in turn is disgusted with their golden calf and hateful idolatry. No wonder it is added, <span class="accented">Mine anger is waxed hot</span> (has burnt or blazed out) <span class="accented">against them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not the calf and Samaria, nor the calves, but their stupid, sinful worshippers. <span class="cmt_word">How long will it be ere they attain to innocence?</span> Or it may be translated, <span class="accented">How long will it be ere they shall be able to endure</span> (bear) <span class="accented">innocence</span> (guiltlessness)? The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span>, has frequently to be supplemented by another verb, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, "A proud heart will not I suffer;" so also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>. The speaker here turns, as it were, from unwilling auditors to others more ready to lend ancar, and asks, "How long are they incapable of purity of life instead of the abominations of idolatry? How great the madness that, while I allow space and place for repentance, they are unwilling to return to soundness of mind! " The Authorized Version rendering is supported by Aben Ezra and Kimchi. The former explains: "It is as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> were written double, ' Thee as thy calf cast off - thee Samaria, as if it has rejected thee, for the city shall be laid and its inhabitants shall go into captivity;'" and Kimchi says, "<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> is transitive, and has the meaning of ' remove,' as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>. He says, 'O Samaria, thy calf has removed thee,' that is, on account of it thou art removed out of thy land." The last clause is also well explained by Kimchi, though in a different sense from that given above, thus: "How long are they unable to purify themselves from this guilt (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. idolatry)?" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In those times shall many rise up against the king of the south (&#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a>); also &#1506;&#1502;&#1498; &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, the violent people of the nation (of the Jews), shall raise themselves against him. &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; .mih ts &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; are such as belong to the classes of violent men who break through the barriers of the divine law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-10.htm">Ezekiel 18:10</a>).
