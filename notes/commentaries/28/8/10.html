Much depends on the reference of the word “them.” We prefer to regard it as referring to Ephraim rather than to the nations (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Assyria and Egypt). Render, <span class= "ital">I will gather them</span> (<span class= "ital">Israel</span>)<span class= "ital"> together, so that in a short time they may delay</span> (this translation approved by Ewald, Wünsche, and Simson) <span class= "ital">to render the tribute burden due to the king of princes</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Assyrian monarch). “Gather them together,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in restraint, so that they cannot roam so wildly, seeking help (Ewald). This accords with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-8.htm" title="For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.">Hosea 2:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>.

Bishop Horsley, who thinks that the kings and princes, or rulers, of Israel are here intended, renders this clause differently, thus: <span class="ital">And ere long they shall sorrow on account of the burden, the king and the rulers: </span>that is, “Ere long the king and the rulers will lament the impolitic expense incurred in gifts and presents to their faithless allies, and the burden of taxes for that purpose laid upon the people.” The reading of<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ושׂרים</span>, <span class="ital">and rulers, </span>“is supported,” says he, “by such a weight of authority, that I cannot but adopt it; and yet there is no difficulty in the construction of the common text.

The hopes of sinners will deceive them, and their gains will be snares. In times of danger, especially in the day of judgment, all carnal devices will fail. They take a course by themselves, and like a wild ass by himself, they will be the easier and surer prey for the lion. Man is in nothing more like the wild ass's colt, than in seeking for that succour and that satisfaction in the creature, which are to be had in God only.

The sin of Israel should bring its own punishment. He sent presents to the king of Assyria, in order to strengthen himself against the will of God; "he thought himself secured by his league made with them; but he should find himself much deceived in his policy;" he had "hired among them" only; "now," ere long, very speedily, God Himself would "gather them," i. e., those very nations, not in part, but altogether; not for the help of Israel, but for its destruction. As though a man would let out some water from a deep lake ponded up, the water, as it oozed out, loosened more and more the barriers which withheld it, until, at length, all gave way, and the water of the lake was poured out in one wide wild waste, desolating all, over which it swept.

This interpretation is strongly confirmed by the next clause.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes</span>] ‘The king of princes’ is a phrase not found elsewhere, but might conceivably = ‘the king of kings’, which is a title claimed by Tiglath-Pileser I.

But why ‘sorrow <span class="ital">a little’?</span> No better sense is made by rendering ‘and they shall begin to be diminished [in numbers, or in prosperity] by reason of the burden of the king of princes’; why ‘begin’? A third rendering, ‘and they shall soon be in anguish through the burden’ &c. involves a violation of Hebrew usage (‘soon’ should be ‘a little’). The only remedy is to follow the Septuagint, which reads two of the Hebrew words differently, and render <span class="bld">that they may cease for a little from anointing a king and princes</span> (all the versions and some Hebr.

"Though they have sued for endearments among the nations, I will gather them out of the nations among which they have been dispersed, as the same verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5e6;</span>, is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54.htm">Isaiah 54</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>, <span class="accented">viz</span>. 'I will not delay their deliverance."' This exposition is not in harmony with the context, from which we expect a threat of punishment rather than a promise of reward. Both Kimchi and Aben Ezra favor exposition <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "What benefit is it to them, asks the prophet, that they sue among the nations? For soon I will gather the nations against them to carry them into captivity." Thus Kimchi and somewhat similarly Aben Ezra. Whether we take the verb as pointed with daghesh in the <span class="accented">tav</span>, and so from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5df;</span>, to give, that is, gifts to lovers, or without daghesh, and from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;</span>, to hire or bargain, makes little difference in the general sense of the clause. And they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. This fixes with more definiteness the meaning of the foregoing member of the verse. According to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> this rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (Qeri) Hiph. from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>, "a little" would require to be taken Ironically; it is better, therefore, to render it "in a little time." The burden is not that of taxation or even deportation, but of oppression in exile. The oppressor is the monarch of Assyria, who <span class="accented">asks</span> boastingly. "Are not my princes altogether kings?" Another <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> translation is, "They will begin to diminish on account of the burden of the king of princes.' According to this the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> is future of Hiph. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, to begin, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span> is either an infinitive for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5d8;</span>, or rather a verbal adjective: and the sense is that they begin to be or become fewer in consequence of the <span class="accented">Assyrian's</span> oppression. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> taking the verb from the same root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span> cognate with Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, loose, set free, Gesenius translates, "<span class="accented">And</span> they (the hostile nations) shall presently force them from the burden (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the unpleasant dominion)of the king."

Our choice must lie between <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in interpreting this difficult clause; there is a modification of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> worth mentioning; it is: "They shall in a little while sorrow for the burden which they pay (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the tribute which they pay) kings and princes," viz. all of them, the two concluding words being thus in apposition to the subject of the verb. On the whole, we prefer there rendering of the clause in the Authorized Version, as both grammatical and supplying a sense consistent with the context. The prophet foretells that Israel would ere long feel painfully the sorrowful consequences of their going to Assyria and suing there for help. Oppressed by a yearly tribute to the Assyrian king, they would smart under the yoke, and long to be free. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>His fate further drives him to make an assault on the islands and maritime coasts of the west (&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), many of which he takes. &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; is not, after the Keri, to be changed into &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;; for turning himself from Egypt to the islands, he turns back his face toward his own land in the north.

This rendering we must, with Kranichfeld, accede to, and accordingly understand &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; of the king of the north, and interpret the indefinite &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1503; (leader, chief) in undefined generality or collectively, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; (his reproach) as the second object subordinated to &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1503;, and refer &#1500;&#1493; as the dative to &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1503;. Thus the second &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; gains expressiveness corresponding to its place before the verb as the contrast to &#1500;&#1493; (&lt;) &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;: "however his reproach," i.e., the dishonour he did to the chiefs, "shall they recompense to him." The subject to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; is the collective &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1503;. The statement of the last clause introduces us to the announcement, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-19.htm">Daniel 11:19</a>, of the overthrow of the king of the north, who wished to spread his power also over the west. Since the chiefs (princes) of the islands rendered back to him his reproach, i.e., required to him his attack against them, he was under the necessity of returning to the fortresses of his own land. With that begins his fall, which ends with his complete destruction. </body></html>
