It was chiefly on account of their cavalry that the Jews and Israelites courted the help of Egypt, having no cavalry of their own. This is the first part of the people’s repentance. It consists in their renouncing all dependance on foreign alliances, and on every arm of flesh. The second is, their renouncing every species of idolatry and image-worship, expressed in the next clause, <span class="ital">Neither will we say, &c., to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods — </span>This is often spoken of in the prophets, as an introduction to that state of the church which is to commence from the time of the conversion of the Jews: see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-17.htm" title="For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.">Hosea 2:17</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm" title="For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.">Isaiah 1:29</a>. <span class="ital">For in thee the fatherless findeth mercy — </span>Thou art the helper of the weak and friendless; of us, who are unable to help ourselves, and are exposed to the injuries of others, having none to defend us. Observe, reader, God never fails to be the helper of all that are destitute of strength in themselves, and destitute of help from others: and who, being sensible of their helpless condition, look for it from God, who hath sufficient power, mercy, and wisdom to help.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-3 Israel is exhorted to return unto Jehovah, from their sins and idols, by faith in his mercy, and grace through the promised Redeemer, and by diligently attending on his worship and service. Take away iniquity; lift it off as a burden we are ready to sink under, or as the stumbling-block we have often fallen over. Take it all away by a free and full forgiveness, for we cannot strike any of it off. Receive our prayer graciously. They do not say what good they seek, but refer it to God. It is not good of the world's showing, but good of God's giving. They were to consider their sins, their wants, and the remedy; and they were to take, not sacrifices, but words stating the desires of their hearts, and with them to address the Lord. The whole forms a clear description of the nature and tendency of a sinner's conversion to God through Jesus Christ. As we draw near to God by the prayer of faith, we should first beseech him to teach us what to ask. We must be earnest with him to take away all iniquity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Asshur shall not save us - After prayer for pardon and for acceptance of themselves, and thanksgiving for acceptance, comes the promise not to fall back into their former sins. Trust in man, in their own strength, in their idols, had been their besetting sins. Now, one by one, they disavow them.<p>First, they disclaim trust in man, and making "flesh their arm" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>. Their disclaimer of the help of the Assyrian, to whom they had so often betaken themselves against the will of God, contains, at once, that best earnest of true repentance, the renewal of the confession of past sins, and the promise to rely no more on any princes of this world, of whom he was then chief. The horse, in like way, is the symbol of any warlike strength of their own. As the Psalmist says, "Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; and, "a horse is a vain thing for safety, neither shall he deliver any by his great strength" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-17.htm">Psalm 33:17</a>; and Solomon, "The horse is prepared for the day of battle but salvation is of the Lord" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>. War was almost the only end for which the horse was used among the Jews. If otherwise, it was a matter of great and royal pomp. It was part of a standing army. Their kings were especially forbidden to "multiply horses" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> to themselves. Solomon, indeed, in his prosperity, broke this, as well as other commands of God. The pious king Hezekiah, although possessed at one time of large treasure, so kept that command as to furnish matter of mockery to Rabshakeh, the blaspheming envoy of Assyria, that he had neither horses nor horsemen <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-23.htm">2 Kings 18:23</a>. The horses being procured from Egypt <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>, the commerce gave fresh occasion for idolatry.<p>Neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands, ye are our gods - This is the third disavowal. Since it was folly and sin to trust in the creatures which God had made, apart from God, how much more, to trust in things which they themselves had made, instead of God, and offensive to God!<p>For in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy - (or, O Thou, in whom). He is indeed fatherless who hath not God for his Father. They confess then, that they were and deserved to be thus "fatherless" and helpless, a prey to every oppressor; but they appeal to God by the title which He had taken, "the Father of the fatherless" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>, that He would have mercy on them, who had no help but in Him. : "We promise this, they say, hoping in the help of Thy mercy, since it belongeth to Thee and is for Thy Glory to have mercy on the people which believeth in Thee, and to stretch forth Thine Hand, that they may be able to leave their wonted ills and amend their former ways." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Three besetting sins of Israel are here renounced, trust in Assyria, application to Egypt for its cavalry (forbidden, De 17:16; compare Ho 7:11; 11:5; 12:1; 2Ki 17:4; Ps 33:17; Isa 30:2, 16; 31:1), and idolatry.<p>fatherless&#8212;descriptive of the destitute state of Israel, when severed from God, their true Father.

God promised his peculiar protection, and would have continued it if they had not cast him off, and trusted to man. We will not ride upon horses: another fault of theirs was, they multiplied horses, and trusted to their strength, which God forbade; this includes their home strength, and provision of all sorts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods:</span> they had most brutishly thought their idols would be gods to help them; this is the particular confession of their great comprehensive sins, which brought on many others with them; now they renounce as well as confess them, and such renouncing is necessary, and grounded on hope of finding mercy, as appears by the reason they give of their renouncing these sins, and vain confidences in God, to whom they return, in him only there is help to be had. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The fatherless; </span> all that are destitute of strength in themselves, and destitute of help from others; all that, being sensible of their own helpless condition, look for it from God, who hath power, mercy, and wisdom to hell) and relieve. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Findeth, </span> obtaineth as often as he does rightly sue for, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">mercy; </span> both fountain and streams of goodness too, free grace and rich bounty. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hosea/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ashur shall not save us,.... This is still a continuation of the words repenting and returning Israel are directed to make use of before the Lord, declaring they would not do any more as they had done; to Assyria, or the kings of Assyria, as the Targum, for help, and desire assistance, and expect deliverance and salvation from thence; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>; <p>we will not ride upon horses; to seek for help elsewhere; or go to Egypt for them, as they had done; or put their trust in them for safety, in a time of war; or think to make their escape by them when in danger; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a>; <p>neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, ye are our gods; that is, say so to, or concerning, their idols, which were made by their hands, or by their orders, as they had formerly done to the golden calf in the wilderness, and to the calves at Dan and Bethel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>; now, by all these expressions is meant, that they would determine not to put any confidence in any creature, or in any creature performance; that they would not trust in their own merits, but in the mercy of God through Christ for the of their sins; nor in any works of righteousness for their justification before God, and acceptance with him; nor expect salvation in any other way than by the free grace of God, and his abundant mercy in Christ: <p>for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy; and in thee only; hereby declaring that the Lord was the only Saviour; that there was salvation in Christ, and in no other; and that they would have no other saviour but him; that they would look to the mercy of God proclaimed in him, and communicated from and through him, the mercy seat, and to his mercy alone for eternal life; in whom the most destitute persons, as the fatherless, who are destitute of friends, of help and assistance, of counsel and advice, find favour, kindness, and mercy, even such as are most hopeless and helpless; which is a great encouragement to look to the Lord, to trust in him, and hope in his mercy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Asshur shall <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, <i>Ye are</i> our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</span><p>(d) We will forsake all vain confidence and pride.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>.

Here was a renunciation of all hope of safety from the world-powers - both Assyria and Egypt. They would never again have recourse to Assyria for help, nor to Egypt for horses; nor confide in their own unaided power or prowess; while this renunciation of worldly power and carnal confidences implied, as its opposite, unfaltering faith in the protecting power and saving strength of Jehovah. All thin was much, and yet more was required; next to such renunciation of merely human aid, as indicated, and its contrary, the recognition of Divine assistance, comes the absolute and complete abandonment of their national and besetting sin of idolatry. They have so far come to themselves and received the right use of reason as to confess that the manufacture of man's hands cannot be man's god, thus giving up with feelings of contempt and disgust the groveling sin of idolatry with its attendant vices. Still more, they are penetrated with the conviction that man without God is a poor fatherless creature, in no better, if not in a worse, condition than that of a weak orphan child. They have the consolation at the same time that for all such, on their return to him, the father of the fatherless and the God of the orphan has bowels of tenderest compassion. To the presumed prayer of the penitent an answer overflowing with mercy is promised at once, and by God himself in the next section, consisting of - <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These crimes bring the land to ruin. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>. "Therefore the land mourns, and every dweller therein, of beasts of the field and birds of the heaven, wastes away; and even the fishes of the sea perish." These words affirm not only that the inanimate creation suffers in consequence of the sins and crimes of men, but that the moral depravity of men causes the physical destruction of all other creatures. As God has given to man the dominion over all beasts, and over all the earth, that he may use it for the glory of God; so does He punish the wickedness of men by pestilences, or by the devastation of the earth. The mourning of the earth and the wasting away of the animals are the natural result of the want of rain and the great drought that ensues, such as was the case in the time of Ahab throughout the kingdom of the ten tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>), and judging from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/8-8.htm">Amos 8:8</a>, may have occurred repeatedly with the continued idolatry of the people.
