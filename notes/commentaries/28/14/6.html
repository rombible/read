His anger is turned from them. Whom God loves, he loves freely; not because they deserve it, but of his own good pleasure. God will be to them all they need. The graces of the Spirit are the hidden manna, hidden in the dew; the grace thus freely bestowed on them shall not be in vain. They shall grow upward, and be more flourishing; shall grow as the lily. The lily, when come to its height, is a lovely flower, Mt 6:28,29. They shall grow downward, and be more firm. With the flower of the lily shall be the strong root of the cedar of Lebanon. Spiritual growth consists most in the growth of the root, which is out of sight. They shall also spread as the vine, whose branches extend very widely. When believers abound in good works, then their branches spread. They shall be acceptable both to God and man. Holiness is the beauty of a soul. The church is compared to the vine and the olive, which bring forth useful fruits. God's promises pertain to those only that attend on his ordinances; not such as flee to this shadow only for shelter in a hot gleam, but all who dwell under it. When a man is brought to God, all who dwell under his shadow fare the better. The sanctifying fruits shall appear in his life. Thus believers grow up into the experience and fruitfulness of the gospel. Ephraim shall say, God will put it into his heart to say it, What have I to do any more with idols! God's promises to us are more our security and our strength for mortifying sin, than our promises to God. See the power of Divine grace. God will work such a change in him, that he shall loathe the idols as much as ever he loved them. See the benefit of sanctified afflictions. Ephraim smarted for his idolatry, and this is the fruit, even the taking away his sin, Isa 27:9. See the nature of repentance; it is a firm and fixed resolution to have no more to do with sin. The Lord meets penitents with mercy, as the father of the prodigal met his returning son. God will be to all true converts both a delight and a defence; they shall sit under his shadow with delight. And as the root of a tree; From me is thy fruit found: from Him we receive grace and strength to enable us to do our duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will be as the dew unto Israel - Before, He had said, "his spring shall become dry and his fountain shall be dried up" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>. Now again He enlarges the blessing; their supply shall be unfailing, for it shall be from God; yea, God Himself shall be that blessing; "I will be the dew; descending on the mown grass" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>, to quicken and refresh it; descending, Himself, into the dried and parched and sere hearts of men, as He saith, "We will come unto him and make Our abode in him" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>. The grace of God, like the dew, is not given once for all, but is, day by day, waited for, and, day by day, renewed. Yet doth it not pass away, like the fitful goodness <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a> of God's former people, but turns into the growth and spiritual substance of those on whom it descends.<p>He shall grow as the lily - No one image can exhibit the manifold grace of God in those who are His own, or the fruits of that grace. So the prophet adds one image to another, each supplying a distinct likeness of a distinct grace or excellence. The "lily" is the emblem of the beauty and purity of the soul in grace; the "cedar" of Lebanon, of its strength and deep-rootedness, its immovableness and uprightness; the evergreen "olive tree" which "remaineth in its beauty both winter and summer," of the unvarying presence of Divine Grace, continually, supplying an eversustained freshness, and issuing in fruit; and the fragrance of the aromatic plants with which the lower parts of Mount Lebanon are decked, of its loveliness and sweetness; as a native explains this , "he takes a second comparison from Mount Lebanon for the abundance of aromatic things and odoriferous flowers."<p>Such are the myrtles and lavender and the odoriferous reed; from which  "as you enter the valley" (between Lebanon and Anti-lebanon) "straightway the scent meets you." All these natural things are established and well-known symbols of things spiritual. The lily, so called in Hebrew from its dazzling whiteness, is, in the Canticles Sol 2:1-2, the emblem of souls in which Christ takes delight. The lily multiplies exceedingly : yet hath it a weak root and soon fadeth. The prophet, then, uniteth with these, plants of unfading green, and deep root. The seed which "had no root," our Lord says, "withered away" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-6.htm">Matthew 13:6</a>, as contrariwise, Paul speaks of these, who are "rooted and grounded in love" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>, and of being "rooted and built up in Christ" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>. The widespreading branches are an emblem of the gradual growth and enlargement of the Church, as our Lord says, "It becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>.<p>The symmetry of the tree and its outstretched arms express, at once, grace and protection. Of the "olive" the Psalmist says, "I am like a green olive tree in the house Of God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>; and Jeremiah says, "The Lord called thy name a green olive tree, fair and of goodly fruit" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; and of "fragrance" the spouse says in the Canticles, "because of the savor of Thy good ointments, Thy name is as ointment poured forth" Sol 1:3; and the Apostle says, "thanks be to God, which maketh manifest the savor of His knowledge by us in every place" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>. Deeds of charity also are "an odor of good smell" <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>; the prayers of the saints also are "sweet odors" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>. All these are the fruits of the Spirit of God who says, "I will be as the dew unto Israel." Such reunion of qualities, being beyond nature, suggests the more, that, that, wherein they are all combined, the future Israel, the Church, shall flourish with graces beyond nature, in their manifoldness, completeness, unfadingness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. branches&#8212;shoots, or suckers.<p>beauty &#8230; as the olive&#8212;which never loses its verdure. One plant is not enough to express the graces of God's elect people. The lily depicts its lovely growth; but as it wants duration and firmness, the deeply rooted cedars of Lebanon are added; these, however, are fruitless, therefore the fruitful, peace-bearing, fragrant, ever green olive is added.<p>smell as Lebanon&#8212;which exhaled from it the fragrance of odoriferous trees and flowers.

As the well rooted cedars in Lebanon; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>. This respects the propagation of the church of God, and the interest of Christ in the world, as in the first times of the Gospel, and will be in the latter day; when the Gospel shall be spread everywhere; churches set up in all places; the Jews converted, and the fulness of the Gentiles brought in; and these like spreading branches, and fruitful boughs, abounding in grace and good works. The Targum is, <p>"they shall multiply or increase with sons and daughters:'' <p>and his beauty shall be as the olive tree; which lies in its being laden with excellent fruit, and being always green; for which reasons particular believers, and the whole church of God, are sometimes compared to it; having that fatness in them, with which God and men are honoured; and that true grace, which is signified by oil in the vessels of the heart, and is called the unction and anointing of the Holy One; and they persevering in this grace to the end, which is evergreen and durable, immortal, and dies not; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>. Here again it may be observed, that the trees of Lebanon, though they had strong roots, and spreading branches, yet were not fruitful; and the deficiency of that metaphor is supplied by this of the olive: <p>and his smell as Lebanon; as the trees of Lebanon, the cedars, trees of frankincense, and other odoriferous trees and plants, which grew upon it; here what is wanting in the olive tree, whose smell is not so grateful, is made up by this simile of the trees of Lebanon, and the smell of them; which may denote the sweet and grateful smell the Lord smells in his people, or his gracious acceptance of them in Christ; whose garments of righteousness and salvation on them are as the smell of Lebanon; and whose graces in them exceed the smell of all spices; and whose prayers are odours, and their praises a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savour to God; see Sol 4:10. Some render it, "as incense" (d) called "lebonah" in Hebrew, from whence the mountain is thought to have its name, frankincense growing upon it. So the Targum, <p>"and their smell as the smell of the incense of spices.'' <p>Jarchi says, as the sanctuary, which was made of the cedars of Lebanon. <p>(d) "Ut thuris", Grotius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">I will be as the dew</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">as the night-mist</span>, i.e. the masses of vapour (Hebr. <span class="ital">tal</span>) brought by the damp westerly winds of summer (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-4.htm" title="O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.">Hosea 6:4</a>). ‘In the strict scientific sense of the word, this is rain, and not dew at all, since the vapour becomes condensed in the air before touching the ground’ (Neil, <span class="ital">Palestine Explored</span>, p. 135). The promise comes very appropriately after the ‘I will heal’ of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-4.htm" title="I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for my anger is turned away from him.">Hosea 14:4</a></span>. The baleful effects of the sirocco are often felt in Palestine during the rainless heat of summer, but by the beautiful provision of night-mist all hardy forms of vegetable life are preserved. But to the ‘east-wind’ described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm" title="Though he be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.">Hosea 13:15</a> there was no such counteracting force. A ‘dew’ (‘night-mist’) of supernatural energy (like Gideon’s) was required to vivify that which Assyria had destroyed—what another prophet calls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm" title="Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a>) ‘a dew of lights’, i.e. an influence from the divine Light, could alone undo so complete a catastrophe. Observe how nearly coincident are the conceptions of land and people in Hosea’s mind (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-3.htm" title="Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.">Hosea 2:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">grow</span> [<span class="bld">blossom</span>] <span class="ital">as the lily</span>] So <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/39-14.htm" title="And give ye a sweet savour as frankincense, and flourish as a lily, send forth a smell, and sing a song of praise, bless the Lord in all his works.">Sir 39:14</a>. The image suggests the ideas of profusion and beauty. There is nothing to bind us down to any single individual of the lily species. Indeed, the application of the Hebrew <span class="ital">shôshan</span> was probably as wide as that of the Arabic <span class="ital">sûsan</span> still is, if we may argue from the mention of ‘lilies [oleanders?] by the rivers of waters’ in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/50-8.htm" title="And as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, as lilies by the rivers of waters, and as the branches of the frankincense tree in the time of summer:">Sir 50:8</a>. Dr Thomson’s ‘Hûleh lily’, which abounds in the woods north of Tabor (<span class="ital">The Land and the Book</span>, p. 256), is at least as likely a flower to be meant as any other.

V. ‘goodly cedars’), or perhaps he means the mountains of Lebanon themselves (for the ‘roots’ of a mountain, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-9.htm" title="He puts forth his hand on the rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots.">Job 28:9</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">His branches shall spread</span>] For ‘branches’ render <span class="bld">saplings</span>.

V. ‘tender branch’). There the prophet’s idea is that after Israel’s vine has been cut down, a slender plant will spring up from the root; here, that the root of the living tree shall send forth many fresh plants. In fact, Israel is to be like not merely a tree, but a garden.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as the olive-tree</span>] Beautiful doubtless in itself, but with a beauty enhanced by the serviceableness of the fruits. Jeremiah compares Israel to ‘a fresh-green olive-tree, fair, and of goodly fruit’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm" title="The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.">Jeremiah 11:16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his smell as Lebanon</span>] As the balsamic odour of the cedars and of aromatic shrubs.

"My nation is destroyed for lack of knowledge; for thou, the knowledge hast thou rejected, and so do I reject thee from being a priest to me. Thou didst forget the law of thy God; thy sons will I also forget." The speaker is Jehovah: my nation, that is to say, the nation of Jehovah. This nation perishes for lack of the knowledge of God and His salvation. Hadda&#8219;ath (the knowledge) with the definite article points back to da&#8219;ath Elo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m (knowledge of God) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>. This knowledge Israel might have drawn from the law, in which God had revealed His counsel and will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15</a>), but it would not. It rejected the knowledge and forgot the law of its God, and would be rejected and forgotten by God in consequence. In 'atta&#770;h (thou) it is not the priests who are addressed - the custodians of the law and promoters of divine knowledge in the nation - but the whole nation of the ten tribes which adhered to the image-worship set up by Jeroboam, with its illegal priesthood (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-33</a>), in spite of all the divine threats and judgments, through which one dynasty after another was destroyed, and would not desist from this sin of Jeroboam. The Lord would therefore reject it from being priest, i.e., would deprive it of the privilege of being a priestly nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), would strip it of the privilege of being a priestly nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), would strip it of its priestly rank, and make it like the heathen. According to Olshausen (Heb. Gram. p. 179), the anomalous form &#1488;&#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1488;&#1498; is only a copyist's error for &#1488;&#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1498;; but Ewald (247, e) regards it as an Aramaean pausal form. "Thy sons," the children of the national community, regarded as a mother, are the individual members of the nation. </body></html>
