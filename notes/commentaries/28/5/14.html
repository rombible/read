Assyria is here referred to as represented by Tiglath-pileser. We might also quote from the inscription of Sargon in fulfilment of this prediction: “Samaria I besieged; I captured 27,290 people dwelling in the midst of it; I carried captive” (George Smith, <span class= "ital">Assyrian Eponym Canon,</span> p. 125). A similar fate overtook Jerusalem in 587 B.C., at the hands of Babylonia, in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/36-4.htm" title="And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim.

And it is a mercy that we have timely warning given us, that we may flee from the wrath to come. Compliance with the commandments of men, who thwart the commandments of God, ripens a people for ruin. The judgments of God are sometimes to a sinful people as a moth, and as rottenness, or as a worm; as these consume the clothes and the wood, so shall the judgments of God consume them. Silently, they shall think themselves safe and thriving, but when they look into their state, shall find themselves wasting and decaying. Slowly, for the Lord gives them space to repent. Many a nation; as well as many a person, dies of a consumption. Gradually, God comes upon sinners with lesser judgments, to prevent greater, if they will be wise, and take warning. When Israel and Judah found themselves in danger, they sought the protection of the Assyrians, but this only helped to make their wound the worse. They would be forced to apply to God. He will bring them home to himself, by afflictions. When men begin to complain more of their sins than of their afflictions, then there begins to be some hope of them; and when under the conviction of sin, and the corrections of the rod, we must seek the knowledge of God. Those who are led by severe trials to seek God earnestly and sincerely, will find him a present help and an effectual refuge; for with him is plenteous redemption for all who call upon him. There is solid peace, and there only, where God is.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion - He who would thus strengthen himself by Outward help against God's chastisements, challenges, as it were, the Almighty to a trial of strength. So then God, unwilling to abandon him to himself, changes His dealings, and , "He who had heretofore, in His judgments, seemed but as a tender moth or a weak worm," now shows forth His resistless power, imaged by His creatures in whom the quality of power is most seen. It may again be, that the fiercer animal (literally, the roaring) is associated with the name of Ephraim; that of the younger lion, fierce and eager for prey, yet not full-grown, with that of Judah.<p>I, I will tear - "It is a fearful thing, to fall into the Hands of the Living God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>. The Assyrian was but the rod of God's anger, and the staff, He says, in thine hand is His indignation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>. Whatever is done, is done or overruled by God, who gives to the evil his power to do, in an evil way, what He Himself overrules to the end of His wisdom or justice. God, Himself would tear them asunder, by giving the Assyrians power to carry them away. And since it was God who did it, there was no hope of escape. He who was faithful to His word would do it. There is great emphasis on the I, I. God and not man; He, the author of all good, would Himself be the cause of their evil. What hope then is there, when He, who is mercy, becomes the avenger? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. lion&#8212;The black lion and the young lion are emblems of strength and ferocity (Ps 91:13).<p>I, even I&#8212;emphatic; when I, even I, the irresistible God, tear in pieces (Ps 50:22), no Assyrian power can rescue.<p>go away&#8212;as a lion stalks leisurely back with his prey to his lair.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hosea/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For I, </span> the Lord, whose power is infinite, whose wrath they have enkindled, who hath threatened to extirpate them, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">will be unto Ephraim as a lion; </span> a panther, say some, a very swift beast, wherein he excels the lion, and a very fierce and ravenous creature, wherein he equals the lion; or a lioness, say others: but to leave that, God will make the Assyrian a chirurgeon, such as a fierce, ravenous lion would be to a wounded man. As a young lion to the house of Judah; which is grown up to his strength for mischief, and retains his inclination to gamesomeness, or to play with his prey; so should Judah find himself when caught by this lion, first made a sport to please the tyrannous humour, and after made a feast to feed his ravenous hunger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I, even I, will tear:</span> the threat is doubled to ascertain it and make it more dreadful.

Being provoked by their above conduct and behaviour in seeking to others, and not to him, for help, he threatens to punish them in a more public and severe manner; not be to them only as a moth and rottenness, but as a lion, and as a young lion, creatures strong and fierce, that destroy and devour all that come into their hands, and from whom there is no deliverance: thus the Lord was both to Israel and Judah, by means of the Assyrians and Babylonians; the former are compared to a lion, that devoured Israel; and the latter to a young lion, that broke the bones of Judah; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-17.htm">Jeremiah 50:17</a>; and last of all by means of the Romans, especially to Judah: <p>I, even I, will tear and go away; as a lion tears its prey in pieces it seizes upon, and goes away, and leaves it torn, having satisfied itself; and is in no fear of being pursued, or any vengeance taken on him for what he has done; so the Lord would destroy Israel and Judah, and leave them in their ruinous state, none being able to rise up and avenge their cause. The "I" is doubled, to express the certainty of it: <p>I will take away, and none shall rescue him; as the lion, having glutted itself with its prey, takes the rest away, and carries it to its den, where none dare come and take it from him; so the Lord signifies, that those of Israel and Judah that perished not by the sword of the enemy, or by famine or pestilence, should be carried captive, and none should be able to return them till he pleases: under the wrath and displeasure of God, and under this tearing, rending, and afflictive dispensation, they now are, and will continue till the time of their conversion. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. If a stronger figure is necessary to warn Israel of the destructiveness of his present course, Jehovah will compare himself to a lion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm" title="For thus has the LORD spoken to me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.">Isaiah 31:4</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as a lion, and as a young lion</span>] Hebrew has at least five words for ‘lion’; of the two selected here, the first describes this terror of ancient Palestine as a roarer (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-7.htm" title="Therefore I will be to them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:">Hosea 13:7</a>), the second as covered with a mane.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I, even I</span>] For the axe may be human, but the hand which wields it is divine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-15.htm" title="Shall the ax boast itself against him that hews therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shakes it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.">Isaiah 10:15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will take away</span> …] i.e. I will carry off the prey. The passage reminds us of the comparison of the Assyrians to a lion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-29.htm" title="Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yes, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.">Isaiah 5:29</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - These verses assign a reason for the powerlessness even of the mighty Assyrian monarch to help; and that reason is the Divine interposition. The irresistible Jehovah himself (the addition of the pronoun intensifies, yet more its repetition) now interferes for the destruction of the apostate and rebellious people. <span class="cmt_word">For I am unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah.</span> As we are taught in these words, Jehovah's mode of procedure is now changed. Before it had been slow and silent, though sure destruction, as signified by the moth and woodworm; but now it will be public and patent to the eyes of all, as wall as decisive and powerful, as intimated by the comparison of a lion and young lion. Nor is that all: lion-like, lie will rend before removing the prey - a tearing in pieces and then a carrying away. This well-known habit of the lion finds its counterpart in the subsequent facts of Hebrew history. The northern kingdom was first rent or broken up by Shalmaneser; subsequently the population were carried away into captivity; in like manner the southern kingdom suffered at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">I will go and return to my place.</span> The figurative comparison with a lion is continued in the first clause of ver. 15 also. The lion tears his victim and carries it away, then he retires into his cave or den; so Jehovah, after bringing calamity upon Israel, withdraws from the scene and retires to his own place in heaven, though the heaven of heavens cannot contain him. There, in that unapproachable ether, he is inaccessible to and beyond the reach of the guilty nation that knew not nor valued the former times of merciful visitation. One remedy, and only one, is left and that is found in penitence and prayer. Once they find out their guiltiness and humble themselves in repentance, they may hopefully seek his face and favor. Turning away from human help, and supplicating the gracious help of the Divine presence, they are encouraged by the prospect of relict' and revival; while the means to that end are, no doubt, painful, yet profitable. In the school of affliction they learnt penitence and were brought to their knees in prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a> introduce the following revelation by a statement of the occasion of it. &#1492;&#1492;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; refers back to the date named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-1.htm">Daniel 10:1</a>. The &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; after &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; does not serve to designate the three weeks as common day-weeks, in contrast to the &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>., but is an accusative subordinated to the definition of time which expresses the idea of continuance: three weeks long, or three whole weeks, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1</a>; cf. Gesen. Gramm. 118, 3. For three weeks Daniel mourned and fasted, i.e., abstained from the usual food. &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, precious food, delicacies; but Hv., v. Leng., Maur., Hitz., and Kran. interpret it of leavened bread, so called in contrast to the unleavened paschal bread, the bread of affliction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>). But this contrast is not well founded, for the &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (unleavened cakes) of the passover was not (notwithstanding <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>) bread of sorrow, but pure, holy bread, which Daniel did not eat, in opposition to the law, for three weeks. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; is not to be limited to bread in its narrower sense, but denotes food generally. Flesh and wine are festival food, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-25.htm">Genesis 27:25</a>, which is not had every day. The anointing with oil was the sign of joy and of a joyous frame of mind, as with guests at a banquet, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>, and was intermitted in the time of sorrow; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>. Fasting, as an abstaining from the better sustenance of common life, was the outward sign of sorrow of soul.<p>According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a>, Daniel mourned and fasted in the first month of the year, the month in the middle of which the paschal feast was kept, in which Israel celebrated their deliverance from their state of slavery in Egypt and their advancement to be the people of God, and were joyful before their God. On the 24th day of this month occurred the Theophany (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a>.), with which, however, his fasting came to an end. According to this, it appears that he fasted from the third to the twenty-third of the month Nisan; thus it began immediately after the feast of the new moon, which was kept for two days (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-18.htm">1 Samuel 20:18</a>., 27, 34 with 6:29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>). Thus Hv. and Hitzig conclude; while v. Leng. and Maurer argue, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, that between the time of fasting and the appearance of the angel an interval elapsed, consequently that Daniel fasted from the first to the twenty-first of the month Nisan. But from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a> nothing further follows than that the angel was detained twenty-one days; so that the question as to the beginning and the end of the fast is not certainly answered from the text, and, as being irrelevant to the matter, it can remain undecided. More important is the question as to the cause of such long-continued great sorrow, which is not answered by the remark that he was thus prepared for receiving a divine revelation. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>, Daniel sought &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., understanding as to the state of the matter, or regarding the future of his people, which filled him with concern. The word about the restoration of Jerusalem which he had received through the angel Gabriel in the first year of Darius (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>) had come to pass since that revelation in the first year of Cyrus, but had had only little effect on the religious lukewarmness of the majority of the people. Of the whole people only a very small portion had returned to the land of their fathers, and had begun, after restoring the altar of burnt-offering, to build the house of God in Jerusalem. But while the foundation of the new temple was laid, there mingled with the joyful shoutings of the people also the loud wailings of the old men who had seen the former temple in its glory, when they beheld this building undertaken amid circumstances so depressing and sorrowful (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1-13</a>). In addition to this, the Samaritans immediately, when the Jewish rulers refused for conscience sake to permit them to take part with them in the building, sought, by means of influences used at the Persian court, to prevent the carrying on of the building (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1-5</a>). This sad state of matters could not but, at the beginning of the new year, fill the heart of Daniel with deep sorrow, and move him at the return of the time of the passover to mourn in fasting and prayer over the delay of the salvation promised to his people, and to supplicate in behalf of Israel the pardon of their sins, and their deliverance out of the hand of their enemies. Therefore he mourned and fasted before and during the paschal days for three weeks, until on the twenty-fourth day of the month he received a revelation from God. </body></html>
