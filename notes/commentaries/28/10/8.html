Their hearts were divided. God is the Sovereign of the heart; he will have all, or none. Were the stream of the heart wholly after God, it would run strongly, and bear down all before it. Their pretences to covenant with God were false. Even the proceeding of justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vine is the visible church even at this day!

He had before called "Bethel, house of God," by the name of "Bethaven, house of vanity;" now he calls it "Aven, vanity" or "iniquity," as being the concentration of those qualities. Bethel was situated on a "hill," the "mount of Bethel," and, from different sides, people were said to "go up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>; above <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>) to it. "The high place" often means the shrine, or "the house of the high places." Jeroboam had built such at Bethel <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>; many such already existed in his time, so that, "whoever would, he consecrated" as their "priests" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-32.htm">1 Kings 13:32-33</a>. The high place or shrine, is accordingly said to be "built" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>, "broken down and burnt" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15</a>. At times, they were tents, and so said to be "woven <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>, made of garments of divers colors" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16</a>. The calf then, probably, became a center of idolatry; many such "idol-shrines" were formed around it, on its mount, until Bethel became a metropolis of idolatry. This was "the sin of Israel," as being the source of all its sins.<p>The thorn and the thistle shall come up upon their altars - This pictures, not only the desolation of the place, as before <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>, but the forced cessation of idolatry. Fire destroys, down to the root, all vegetable life which it has once touched. The thorn, once blackened by fire, puts out no fresh shoot. But now, these idol fires having been put out forever, from amid the crevices of the broken altars, "thorn and thistle"  should grow freely as in a fallow soil. Where the victims aforetime "went up"  is also a sacrificial term), or were offered, now the wild briars and thistles alone should "go up," and wave freely in undisputed possession. Ephraim had "multiplied altars," as God multiplied their "goods;" now their altars should be but monunments of the defeat of idolatry. They remained, but only as the grave-stones of the idols, once worshiped there.<p>They shall say to the mountains, cover us - Samaria and Bethel, the seats of the idolatry and of the kingdom of Israel, themselves both on heights, had both, near them, mountains higher than themselves. Such was to Bethel, the mountain on the East, where Abraham built an altar to the Lord <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>; Samaria was encircled by them. Both were probably scenes of their idolatries; from both, the miseries of the dwellers of Bethel and Samaria could be seen. Samaria especially was in the center of a sort of amphitheater; itself, the spectacle. No help should those high places now bring to them in their need. The high hills round Samaria, when the tide of war had filled the valley around it, hemmed them in, the more hopelessly. There was no way, either to break through or to escape. The narrow passes, which might have been held, as flood gates against the enemy, would then be held against them. One only service could it seem, that their mountains could then render, to destroy them. So should they be freed from evils worse than the death of the body, and escape the gaze of people upon their misery. "They shall wish rather to die, than to see what will bring death." "They shall say to the mountains on which they worshiped idols, fall on us, and anticipate the cruelty of the Assyrians and the extreme misery of captivity." Nature abhors annihilation; man shrinks from the violent marring of his outward form; he clings, however debased, to the form which God gave him. What misery, then, when people long for, what their inmost being shrinks from!<p>The words of the prophet become a sort of proverbial saying for misery, which longs for death rather than life. The destruction of Samaria was the type of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and of every other final excision, when the measure of iniquity was filled, and there was neither hope nor remedy. This was the characteristic of the destruction of Samaria. They had been God's people; they were to be so no more. This was the characteristic of the destruction of Jerusalem, not by the Babylonians, after which it was restored, but by the Romans, when they had rejected Christ, and prayed, "His Blood be on us and on our children." So will it be in the end of the world. Hence, our Lord uses the words <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>, to forewarns of the miseries of the destruction of Jerusalem, when the Jews hid themselves in caves for fear of the Romans ; and John uses them to picture man's despair at the end of the world <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>. "I dread" says Bernard , "the gnawing worm, and the living death. I dread to fall into the hands of a living death, and a dying life. This is "the second death," which never out-killeth, yet which ever killeth. How would they long to die once, that they may not die forever! "They who say to the mountains, fall on us, and to the hills, cover us," what do they will, but, by the aid of death, either to escape or to end death? "They shall seek death, but shall not find it, and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them," saith John" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Bethel, which is not only as before called Bethaven, the house of iniquity; but Aven, iniquity itself; the high places of it were the temple and altars built there for idolatrous service, which were usually set on hills and mountains: <p>the sin of Israel shall be destroyed; that is, which high places are the sin of Israel, the occasion of sin unto them; and where they committed sin, the sin of idolatry, in worshipping the calves; these should be thrown down, demolished, and no longer used: <p>the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; lying in ruins, these shall grow upon them, the people and priests being carried captive that used to sacrifice upon them; but now they shall lie deserted by them, being destroyed by the enemy: <p>and they shall say to the mountains, cover us; and to the hills, fall on us; not that the high places and altars shall say so in a figurative sense, according to R.

These unlawful places of sacrifice and unholy places of iniquity are further characterized by the appositional "the sin of Israel." By constructing and frequenting such places Israel had primarily and grievously sinned. By sacrificing to and worshipping even Jehovah on these high places instead of in Jerusalem, the only legal place for Divine service under the Law, their national sin in the matter of worship began; subsequently, <span class="accented">however</span>, things became worse, and these high places became scenes of most abominable idolatries and shamelessly sinful practices. Those places - one and all - are in the words before us doomed to destruction. <span class="cmt_word">The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars.</span> The destruction is thus vividly described as total and complete; those bad eminences were devoted to entire wasteness and desolation. "It is a sign of extreme solitude," says Jerome, "so that no traces even of wall or buildings remained to be seen;" similarly Rashi says, "Thorns and thistles shall grow up upon their altars, because the worshippers thereof have departed and no one longer remains to attend to them" so Kimchi: "On the altars of Israel which they (the enemies) shall lay waste shall thorns spring up." <span class="cmt_word">And they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</span> The sight of such fearful ruin and desolation overwhelms the wretched inhabitants of the land with distress and dismay; in sheer despair and even desperation they invoke a sure and sudden death as much preferable to their remaining longer spectators of such heart-rending scenes. Their exclamation appears to be proverbial, and to have had its origin in the custom of the Israelites fleeing, in seasons of great calamities, to the mountains and clefts of the rocks to hide themselves; thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a> we read that "because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and eaves, and strongholds." The object of their exclamation is to be buried under the hills or mountains rather than endure such calamities longer; or rather than the enemies should see them in their shame. Aben Ezra makes "altars" the subject of "shall say," as if it were the wish of the altars to be covered that they may never more be seen. Theodoret considers the sense of the passage to be that the multitude of calamities in the war occasioned by hostile invasion would be so great that there would be no one who would not prefer being overwhelmed in an earthquake or by the sudden fall of the mountains, rather than endure the calamities inflicted by the enemies. Similarly, but more concisely, Jerome says, "They are more willing to die than see the evils that bring death." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then shall they who in the times of tribulation have led many to the knowledge of salvation receive the glorious reward of their faithfulness. With this thought the angel closes the announcement of the future. &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; refers back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-33.htm">Daniel 11:33-35</a>, and is here, as there, not limited to the teachers, but denotes the intelligent who, by instructing their contemporaries by means of word and deed, have awakened them to stedfastness and fidelity to their confession in the times of tribulation and have strengthened their faith, and some of whom have in war sealed their testimony with their blood. These shall shine in eternal life with heavenly splendour. The splendour of the vault of heaven (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>) is a figure of the glory which Christ designates as a light like the sun ("The righteous shall shine forth as the sun," <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-43.htm">Matthew 13:43</a>, referring to the passage before us). Cf. for this figure also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-40.htm">1 Corinthians 15:40</a>.

But this interpretation is not satisfactory. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a> the Servant of Jehovah justifies many, not by the sacrifice, but by His righteousness, by this, that He, as &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; who has done no sin, takes upon Himself the sins of the people and gives His soul an offering for sin. &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; is neither in the law of sacrifices nor anywhere in the O.T. named as the effect of the sacrifice, but always only &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;) (to take up, take away iniquity) and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, and in the expiatory sacrifices with the constant addition &#1500;&#1493; (&lt;) &#1493;&#1504;&#1505;&#1500;&#1495;; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-26.htm">Leviticus 4:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-31.htm">Leviticus 4:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-35.htm">Leviticus 4:35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-16.htm">Leviticus 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>.<p>Nor is the practice of offering sacrifice anywhere described as a &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;.
