The Hebrew <span class="greekheb">עתה יאשׁמו</span>, may be rendered, <span class="ital">now shall they be punished, </span>or, <span class="ital">treated as guilty. So </span>the Vulgate, <span class="ital">nunc interibunt, now, </span>that is, <span class="ital">forthwith, shall they perish. He shall break down their altars, </span>&c. — That is, God shall cause their idolatrous altars to be broken down, namely, by the Assyrians. <span class="ital">For now they shall say — </span>They shall see and feel, and be compelled to own; <span class="ital">We have no king — </span>Absolutely none, or no such king as we need and expected. This is thought by some commentators to relate to the time of anarchy, or the interregnum which continued for eight or nine years between the murder of Pekah and the settlement of Hoshea on the throne; <span class="ital">because we feared not the Lord — </span>They shall be sensible that their forsaking the Lord for idols, and their casting off his fear, is the true cause of all their calamities; and particularly of their being deprived of the blessing of a wise, just, and good civil government. <span class="ital">What then — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">But what should a king do for us? </span>A king could not save us without the help of God. The verse, however, seems rather to refer to the time of their captivity, and the sense probably is, “After Israel shall be carried captive into the country of their enemies, and shall have no king over their nation, they shall then acknowledge that this misfortune has happened to them through their own fault, and because they have not feared the Lord. And they shall acknowledge that it would profit them nothing to have kings, without having also the protection of God.” — Calmet.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 A vine is only valuable for its fruit; but Israel now brought no fruit to perfection. Their hearts were divided. God is the Sovereign of the heart; he will have all, or none. Were the stream of the heart wholly after God, it would run strongly, and bear down all before it. Their pretences to covenant with God were false. Even the proceeding of justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vine is the visible church even at this day! But all earthly prosperity is but a collection of bubbles, soon destroyed like foam upon the water. Sinners will in vain seek shelter from that Judge, whom they now despise as a Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their heart is divided - Between God and their idols, in that they would not wholly part with either, as Elijah upbraided them, "How long halt ye between the two opinions?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>. When the pagan, by whom the king of Assyria replaced them, had been taught by one of the priests whom the king sent back, in order to avert God's judgments, they still propagated this division. Like Jeroboam <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-32.htm">2 Kings 17:32-33</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-41.htm">2 Kings 17:41</a>, they became fearers of the Lord," His worshipers, "and made to themselves out of their whole number (i. e., indiscriminately) priests of the high places. They were fearers of the Lord, and they were servers of their gods, according to the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence. These nations were fearers of the Lord, and they were servers of their idols, both their children and their children's children. As did their fathers, so do they unto this day."<p>This divided allegiance was their hereditary worship. These pagan, as taught by one of the priests of Israel, added the service of God to that of their idols, as Israel had added the service of the idols to that of God. But God rejecteth such half service; from where he adds, "now," in a brief time, all but come, "they shall be found faulty," literally, "they shall be guilty," shall be convicted of guilt and shall bear it. They thought to "serve at once God and Mammon;" but, in truth, they served their idols only, whom they would not part with for God. God Himself then would turn away all their worship, bad, and, as they thought, good. "He," from whom their heart was divided, He Himself, by His mighty power which no man can gain-say, "shall break down their altars," literally, shall "behead" them. As they out of His gifts multiplied their altars and killed their sacrifices upon them against His will, so now should the altars themselves, be demolished; and "the images" which they had decked with the gold which He had given, should, on account of that very gold, tempt the spoiler, through whom God would spoil them.<p>He shall break down - He Himself. The word is emphatic. : "God willeth not that, when the merited vengeance of God is inflicted through man, it should be ascribed to man. Yea, if anyone ascribeth to himself what, by permission of God, he hath power to do against the people of God, he draweth down on him the displeasure of God, and, at times, on that very ground, can hurt the less" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-26.htm">Deuteronomy 32:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a> ff). The prophet then says very earnestly, "He Himself shall break," meaning us to understand, not the lofty hand of the enemy, but that the Lord Himself did all these things. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. heart &#8230; divided&#8212;(1Ki 18:21; Mt 6:24; Jas 4:8).<p>now&#8212;that is, soon.<p>he&#8212;Jehovah.<p>break down&#8212;"cut off," namely the heads of the victims.

Some say from Hoshea their king, who would have reformed them from their idolatry, and returned them to the true worship of God; but of that there is no proof; better from one another, their affections being alienated from each other, by their discords and animosities, their conspiracies against their kings, and the murders of them, and the civil wars among themselves; they also not being of one mind, but disagreeing in their sentiments about their idols; some being for one, and some for another: or rather from God himself, from the fear of him, from his worship and service; or from the law, as the Targum; or their hearts were divided between God and their idols, as in Ahab's time between God and Baal; they pretended to worship God when they worshipped the calves, and so shared the service between them; or it may be rendered, "their heart flatters" (r) them; as if they had done that which was right and good, and were guilty of no evil, nor would any punishment be inflicted on them: <p>now shall they be found faulty; be convicted of their sin and folly, and appear guilty; when they shall be punished for their idolatry, and their idols not able to save them, as the destruction of them next mentioned will fully evince: or, "now shall they become desolate" (s) their land shall be desolate, and they carried captive: <p>he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images: that is, the king of Assyria shall do all this, or God by him: or, "behead their altars" (t); take off the top of them, as the Targum; the horns of them, which might be made of gold, or other ornaments which were of value; and therefore became the plunder of the enemy; and who also would break in pieces their images, for the sake of the metal, gold or silver, of which they were made; as was usually done by conquerors, and to show their entire power over the conquered, that even their gods could not deliver them out of their hands. <p>(r)  "adblanditur cor eorum", Schmidt.

Here their wickedness is traced to its fountainhead; its source was in the corrupt state of the heart. Their heart was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> divided, and so they halted between two opinions - between the worship of Jehovah and idolatry. <span class="accented">Chalaq</span> is taken in this signification by the Chaldee, Syriac, Septuagint, and Jerome, as also by the Hebrew commentators. The LXX. have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the singular, which affords some support to Hitzig's rendering, "He (God)divided their heart," - but this is unsuitable and unscriptural; another <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> reading of the same version is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "They have divided their hearts," which is somewhat better, yet incorrect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The Authorized Version is also questionable, as the verb is not used intransitively in Qal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Kimchi, indeed, understands <span class="accented">chalaq</span> as equivalent to <span class="accented">niehloq</span> in the Niphal, and interprets, "From the fear of God and from his Law their heart is divided," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. separated; similarly Rashi: "Their heart is divided from me;" Aben Ezra somewhat peculiarly, though to the same purport: "They (their heart) has not one part (but several),"or is divided. But, notwithstanding this consensus in favor of the meaning of "divide," the rendering preferred, and justly so, by modern expositors in general, is "smooth." This is, indeed, the primary sense, that of "divide" being secondary, as division was made by lot or a smooth stone, <span class="accented">cheleq</span>, used for the purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Their heart is <span class="accented">smooth</span>," that is, bland, deceitful, hypocritical; though it must be admitted that the word is mostly applied to the tongue, lip, throat, mouth, speech, and not to the heart. Their heart was hypocritical and faithless. <span class="cmt_word">Now shall they be found faulty</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they shall be dealt with as such</span>, or <span class="accented">punished</span>; better still, perhaps, is the rendering, <span class="accented">now shall they atone</span>. The "<span class="accented">now"</span> defines sharply the turning-point between God's love and God's wrath. The state of things hitherto existing cannot continue; it must soon come to an end. Ere long they are doomed to discover their guilt in its punishment; they shall find out their sin by suffering; suddenly and to their cost they shall have a fearful awaking to a sense of their iniquity by the inflictions of Divine wrath upon their guilty heads. <span class="cmt_word">He shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images</span>. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5e4;</span> is peculiar; being a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>, the neck, it signifies "to break the neck of," like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, decollate, then figuratively "tear down," "break in pieces." This bold expression of breaking the neck of the altars may allude to their destruction by breaking off the horns of the altars, or rather to their beheading, cutting off the heads of victims at those altars. The Hebrew expositors make the heart of the people, not God, the immediate object of the verb. "<span class="accented">Their</span> heart," says one of them, "shall tear down their altars and lay waste their pillars, because it is divided from me. It will tear down their altars which they are said also to have multiplied, and lay waste their pillars which they made so goodly." The means of sinning shall be taken from them and destroyed - their altars broken down and their images spoiled. <span class="accented">As</span> the heads of victims had been cut off at these altars erected for idolatrous worship; so the heads of their altars would be broken off. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The stretching forth of his hand upon the countries is a sign expressive of his seizing them, taking possession of them, for which he falls upon them. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; are not other countries besides those which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>, he overflowed (Klief.), but the same.
