Our Lord has made use of the same words, to denote the extremity of the Jews in the last siege of Jerusalem; and St. John, in the Revelation, to set forth the terror of the wicked in the day of judgment. They express also the great consternation of the wicked when any of God’s singular judgments overtake them, whose guilt prompts them to endeavour to hide themselves, and they even run into the darkest caves and holes of rocks to secure themselves.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 A vine is only valuable for its fruit; but Israel now brought no fruit to perfection.

Not Israel only shall be carried into captivity, but its god also. The victory over a nation was accounted of old a victory over its gods, as indeed it showed their impotence. Hence, the excuse made by the captains of Benhadad, that the gods of "Israel were gods of the hills, and not gods of the valleys" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-23.htm">1 Kings 20:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-28.htm">1 Kings 20:28</a>, and God's vindication of His own Almightiness, which was thus denied. Hence, also the boast of Sennacherib by Rabshakeh, "have any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand? Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>, add, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-10.htm">2 Kings 19:10-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>).<p>When God then, for the sin of His people, gave them into the hand of their enemies, He vindicated His own glory, first by avenging any insult offered to His worship, as in the capture of the ark by the Philistines, or Belshazzar's insolent and drunken abuse of the vessels of the temple; or by vindicating His servants, as in the case of Daniel and the three children, or by chastening pride, as in Nebuchadnezzar, and explaining and pointing His chastisement through His servant Daniel, or by prophecy, as of Cyrus by Isaiah and Daniel. To His own people, His chastisements were the vindication of His glory which they had dishonored, and the close of the long strife between the true prophets and the false. The captivity of the calf ended its worship, and was its final disgrace. The destruction of the temple and the captivity of its vessels and of God's people ended, not the worship, but the idolatries of Judah, and extended among their captors, and their captors' captors, the Medes and Persians, the knowledge of the One true God.<p>Unto Assyria, for a present to king Jareb - (or to a hostile or strifeful king. See the note above at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>.) Perhaps the name "Jareb" designates the Assyrian by that which was a characteristic of their empire, love of "strife." The history of their kings, as given by themselves in the newly-found inscriptions, is one warfare. To that same king, to whom they sent for aid in their weakness, from whom they hoped for help, and whom God named as what He knew and willed him to be to them, "hostile, strifeful," and "an avenger," should the object of their idolatry be carried in triumph. They had trusted in the calf and in the Assyrians. The Assyrian, to whom they looked as the protector of their liberties, was to carry away their other trust, their god .<p>Ephraim shall receive shame - This shall be all his gain; this his purchase; this he had obtained for himself by his pride and willfulness and idolatry and ambition and wars: this is the end of all, as it is of all pursuits apart from God; this he "shall receive" from the Giver of all good, "shame." "And Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel." Ephraim's special "counsel" was that which Jeroboam "took" with the most worldly-wise of his people, a counsel which admirably served their immediate end, the establishment of a kingdom, separate from that of Judah. It was acutely devised; it seemed to answer its end for 230 years, so that Israel, until the latter part of the reign of Pekah, was strong, Judah, in comparison, weak. But it was "the sin wherewith he made Israel to sin," and for which God scattered him among the pagan. His wisdom became his destruction and his shame. The policy which was to establish his family and his kingdom, destroyed his own family in the next generation, and ultimately, his people, not by its failure, but by its success. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Here we have an explanation and confirmation of what has just been said in the preceding verse. The calf, the glorious and magnificent national god, as Israel considered it, is brought to Assyria, and there offered as a present to the Assyrian king. The word <span class="accented">gam</span> is emphatic; that is, "it also," "itself also," or "it also with men and other spoils"  - the golden idol of Beth-aven. Kimchi's explanation of <span class="accented">gam</span> is as follows: "Genesis, extension or generalization of the term, refers to the glory he bad mentioned. He says, 'Lo, in its place the glory shall depart from it as soon as they shall break it. <span class="accented">Also</span>, the stump of the calf, namely, the gold thereon, after its form is broken, they shall take away as a present to King Jareb.'" The sign of the accusative with suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>, which here stands before a passive verb, may be taken either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> absolutely, "<span class="accented">as</span> to it also," "<span class="accented">it</span> shall be brought ;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as an instance of anacoluthon; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span>, according to Gesenius, the passive may be regarded as an impersonal active, and thus it may take the object of the action in the accusative. The word <span class="accented">yubhal</span> is from <span class="accented">yabhal</span>, primarily used of flowing in a strong and violent stream, and so the root of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, the flood; then it signifies "to go," "to be brought or carried." The <span class="accented">minchah</span> here spoken of cannot well mean tribute, but is rather a gift of homage to the Assyrian conqueror, whom the prophet m vision sees already wasting the land of Israel and carrying away all its treasures and precious things. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span> The feminine form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> - of which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>, the masculine, by analogy, is not in use - is wrongly explained by the Hebrew expositors as having a pleonastic <span class="accented">nun</span>. The construction usually preferred is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that given above. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others render it, "Shame shall seize Ephraim;" but tiffs constructs a feminine noun with a masculine verb, contrary to grammar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hitzig translates," He (the Assyrian king) shall take away or carry off the shame of Ephraim; that <span class="accented">is</span>, the calf-idol." He remarks that the construct feminine does not always in the speech of North Israel end in <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5ea;</span>, and cites several passages in proof. The <span class="accented">counsel</span> of which Israel would be ashamed is understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the consultation held before making a covenant or treaty with the King of Assyria; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is generally and more correctly understood of Jeroboam taking counsel with his tribesmen of Ephraim about setting up the calf idols. Jareb is a proper name, or rather an appellation. The King of Assyria, or the great king, was looked up to by the smaller Asiatic states for protection, and consequently styled their <span class="accented">Jareb</span>, avenger or defender, just as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;</span>. savior, was a title applied to or assumed by certain kings for a similar reason, as Ptolemy Soter and others. The object of Israel's idolatry is carried off as a present to propitiate or appease the wrath of the Assyrian patron and protector - probably Shalmaneser in the present instance - or taken as a trophy to grace the triumph of the conqueror. So far from defending the calf-people, as Israel had become, their calf-god could not defend itself; instead of preserving its worshippers from deportation, it was doomed itself to deportation. Ephraim, the premier tribe. received shame, and Israel, the remaining tribes that had followed its lead and adopted its evil counsel, shared the shame; all of them together were thoroughly put to shame because of their mistaken and wicked policy. The counsel of Jeroboam - for to it, in our opinion, is the reference - appeared an able stroke of policy; but this policy, by which he hoped to detach Israel from Judah, was not only frustrated, but proved positively ruinous, so far were the means from effecting the end, or the end from justifying the wisdom of the means. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514; points back to &#1511;&#1509; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>). At the time of the end, in which the hostile persecutor rises up to subdue the whole world, and sets up his camp in the Holy Land to destroy many in great anger and to strike them with the ban (&#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-44.htm">Daniel 11:44</a>), i.e., totally to outroot them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40-45</a>), the great angel-prince Michael shall come forth and fight for the people of God against their oppressor. Regarding Michael, see under <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, p. 771. "Who stands over the sons of thy people," i.e., stands near, protecting them (cf. for &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; in the sense of coming to protect, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-11.htm">Esther 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-16.htm">Esther 9:16</a>), describes Michael, who carries on his work as Israel's &#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>). That Michael, fighting for Daniel's people, goes forth against the hostile king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a>), is, it is true, not said expressis verbis, but it lies in the context, especially in the &#1506;&#1502;&#1498; &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1496; (they people shall be delivered) of the second half of the verse, as well as in the expressions regarding Michael, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>.<p>But the people of God need such powerful help for their deliverance, because that time shall be one of oppression without any parallel. The description of this oppression seems to be based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a> (C. B. Michaelis, Hengstenberg); but that which is there said is here heightened by the relative clause (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>), which enlarges the thought, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-24.htm">Exodus 9:24</a>. This &#1510;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1514; (time of distress) is the climax of the oppression which the hostile king shall bring upon Israel, and occurs at the same time as the expiry of the last (the seventieth) week, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>. "The salvation of Israel (&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1496;), which is here thought of as brought about under the direction of Michael, coincides essentially with the description, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-18.htm">Daniel 7:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>., 14, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>." Thus Kranichfeld rightly remarks. He also rightly identifies the continued victorious deliverance of Israel from the oppression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>) with the setting up of the Messianic kingdom, described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, and finds in this verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>) the Messianic kingdom dissolving the world-kingdoms.<p>With this the opposers of the genuineness of the book of Daniel also agree, and deduce therefrom the conclusion, that the pseudo-Daniel expected, along with the overthrow of Antiochus Epiphanes, the appearance of the Messianic kingdom of glory. This conclusion would be indisputable if the premises from which it is drawn, that &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; (at that time) is the time of Antiochus, were well founded. All attempts of believing interpreters, who, with Porphyry, Grotius, Bleek, v. Lengerke, Hitzig, and others, find the death of Antiochus prophesied in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a>, to dismiss this conclusion, appear on close inspection to be untenable. According to Hvernick, with &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514; (and at that time) a new period following that going before is introduced, and that &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; means at some future time. The appearance of Michael for his people denotes the appearance of the Messiah; and the sufferings and oppressions connected with his appearance denote the sufferings which the people of Israel shall endure at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, but which shall be most fully realized only at the second coming of the Lord, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21-22</a>. But this explanation is shattered against the &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, which never has the meaning "at some time," i.e., in the further future, and is refuted by the following remark of Hitzig: - "Not once," says he, with good ground, "can the words &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; be proved by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-6.htm">2 Kings 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-11.htm">Genesis 39:11</a>, to have the meaning of at that day; in &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1506;&#1514; we may not by any means seek such a meaning, and the copula here puts a complete barrier in the way of such arbitrariness. Moreover, if the epoch of Antiochus Epiphanes was indeed a time of oppression, who could a reader then not refer this &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; to the time of that king described in the foregoing chapter?" Finally, &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (intelligentes), <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>, refers back to the &#1506;&#1501; &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; who helped may to knowledge, and who lost their lives in the persecution (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-33.htm">Daniel 11:33-34</a>), and now are raised to eternal life.<p>(Note: These arguments extend also to the overthrow of Ebrard's view, that the expression "to this time" refers to the time after Antiochus Epiphanes shall have died.)<p>Hvernick, however, was right, in opposing those who refer <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> to the period of persecution under Antiochus, in arguing that the statement of the unheard-of greatness of the affliction is far too strong for such a period, and at the same time that the promise of the deliverance of those that shall be found written in the book does not accord with that Syrian oppression, although he is in error when he interprets the appearance of Michael of the first appearance of Christ. This interpretation receives no support either from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a> or from <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21-22</a>, because both passages treat of the coming of Christ in glory. But if the reference of this verse to the appearance of Christ in the flesh is inconsistent with the words, still more so is its reference to the period of Antiochus. Those interpreters who advance this view are under the necessity of violently separating <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> from <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>, which undoubtedly treat of the resurrection from the dead.<p>According to Auberlen, who has rightly conceived that the &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>, allude to the &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-33.htm">Daniel 11:33</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-34.htm">Daniel 11:34</a>, the &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497; to the &#1500;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-33.htm">Daniel 11:33</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a> do not intimate any progress in the development of the history, but by mentioning the resurrection only, are referred to the eternal retribution which awaits the Israelites according to their conduct during the time of great persecution under Antiochus, because, as C. B. Michaelis has said, ejus (i.e., of the resurrection) consideratio magnam vim habet ad confirmandum animum sub tribulationibus. As to the period between the time of trial and the resurrection, nothing whatever is said; for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a> every designation of time is wanting, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> the expression "at this time" twice occurs. Thus Hengstenberg (Christol. iii. 1, p. 6) has remarked, "Whether there be a longer or a shorter time between the tribulation of the Maccabean era and the resurrection, the consolation from the fact of the resurrection remains equally powerful. Therefore it is so connected with the deliverance from the persecution as if the one immediately followed the other." But with this it is conceded that the resurrection from the dead is so associated with the deliverance of Israel from the tyranny of Antiochus as if it came immediately after it, as the opponents of the genuineness of the book affirm. But this interpretation is obviously a mere make-shift. </body></html>
