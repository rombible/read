By describing the first of these two cities as polluted with blood, and the high-road to the other as beset with knots of priests, like robbers, intent on blood, and murdering on the whole length of the way, up to the very walls of the town, the prophet means to represent the priests as seducers of the people to that idolatry which proved the ruin of the nation. Insomuch that, like a man who should be murdered in a place of religious retreat, or upon his way to it, the people, under the influence of such guides, met their destruction in the quarter where, by God’s appointment, they were to seek their safety.” The word <span class="greekheb">שׁכמה</span>, rendered <span class="ital">by consent, </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-9.htm" title="And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.">Hosea 6:9</a>, signifies <span class="ital">toward Shechem.

Therefore the Lord sent awful messages by the prophets. The word of God will be the death either of the sin or of the sinner. God desired mercy rather than sacrifice, and that knowledge of him which produces holy fear and love. This exposes the folly of those who trust in outward observances, to make up for their want of love to God and man. As Adam broke the covenant of God in paradise, so Israel had broken his national covenant, notwithstanding all the favours they received. Judah also was ripe for Divine judgments.

It had an unity, but of evil. As the whole world has been pictured as divided between "the city of God" and the city of the devil, consisting respectively of the children of God and the children of the devil; so the whole of Gilead may be represented as one city, whose inhabitants had one occupation in common, to work evil. Some think that there was a city so called, although not mentioned elsewhere in Holy Scripture, near that Mount Gilead, dear to the memory of Israel, because God there protected their forefather Jacob. Some think that it was Ramoth in Gilead , which God appointed as "a city of refuge," and which, consequently, became a city of Levites and priests <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>.<p>Here, where God had preserved the life of their forefather, and, in him, had preserved them; here, where He had commanded the innocent shedder of blood to be saved; here, where he had appointed those to dwell, whom He had hallowed to Himself, all was turned to the exact contrary. It, which God had hallowed, was become "a city of workers of iniquity," i. e., of people, whose habits and custom was to work iniquity. It, where God had appointed life to be preserved, was "polluted" or "tracked with blood." Everywhere it was marked and stained with the bloody footsteps of those, who (as David said) "put" innocent "blood in their shoes which were on their feet" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5</a>, staining their shoes with blood which they shed, so that, wherever they went, they left marks and signs of it." "Tracked with blood" it was, through the sins of its inhabitants; "tracked with blood" it was again, when it first was taken captive <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>, and "it, which had swum with the innocent blood of others, swam with the guilty blood of its own people." It is a special sin, and especially avenged of God, when what God had hallowed, is made the scene of sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The chief city in the land of Gilead, which lay beyond Jordan, inhabited by Gad and Reuben, and the half tribe of Manasseh; and so belonged to the ten tribes, whose sins are here particularly observed. It had its name from the country, or the country from that, or both from the mountain of the same name. It is thought to be Ramothgilead, a city of refuge, and put for all the cities of refuge in those parts, which were inhabited by priests and Levites; and who ought to have had knowledge of the laws, and instructed the people in them, and observed them themselves, and set a good example to others; but, instead of this, the whole course of their lives, was vicious; they made a trade of sinning, did nothing else but work iniquity; and this was general among them, the city or cities of them consisted of none else; and all manner of iniquity was committed by them, particularly idolatry; for so the words may be rendered, "a city of them that serve an idol" (a); not only at Dan and Bethel, but in the cities of the priests, idols were set up and worshipped; this shows the state to be very corrupt: <p>and is polluted with blood; with the blood of murderers harboured there, who ought not to have been admitted; or with the blood of such who were delivered up to the avenger of blood, that ought to have been sheltered, and both for the sake of money; or with the blood of children, sacrificed to Mo: the word used has the signification of supplanting, lying in wait, and so is understood of a private, secret, shedding of blood, in a deceitful and insidious way: hence some render it, "cunning for blood" (b); to which the Targum seems to agree, calling it a city <p>"of them that secretly or deceitfully shed innocent blood.'' <p>It has also the signification of the heel of a man's foot, and is by some rendered, "trodden by blood" (c); that is, by bloody men: or "footed" or "heeled by blood" (d); that is, such an abundance of it was shed, that a man could not set his foot or his heel any where but in blood. <p>(a)   "civitas operantium idolum", V.

We still find the name of Gilead (in its Arabic form <span class="ital">Jil‘âd</span>) lingering at various parts of the ancient Gilead, but we cannot venture on a combination with the prophet’s Gilead. Ramoth-Gilead would seem, from its importance, a not unlikely place to be meant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">polluted with blood</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">tracked with bloody foot-prints;</span> comp. the striking expression used of Joab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-5.htm" title="Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.">1 Kings 2:5</a>. The Gileadites, half-civilized mountaineers, seem to have been distinguished for their ferocity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm" title="But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.">2 Kings 15:25</a>). From the next verse we may perhaps infer that at Gilead too the priests were foremost in lawlessness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8, 9</span>. Two spots of specially ill fame are singled out—Gilead and the road to Shechem.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - In these two verses the prophet adduces proof of that faithlessness with which he had just charged Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</span> The latter clause is more literally rendered, <span class="accented">foot-printed</span> or <span class="accented">foot-tracked from blood</span>. Two things require consideration here - the place and its pollution. Gilead is sometimes a mountain range, and sometimes the mountainous region east of the Jordan; it has Bashan on the north, the Arabian plateau on the east, and Moab on the south. It stretches from the south end of the Sea of Galilee to the north end of the Dead Sea - some sixty miles in length by twenty in breadth. The part of Gilead between the Hieromax and the Jabbok is now called <span class="accented">Jebel Ajlun</span>; while the section south of the Jabbok forms the province of <span class="accented">Belka</span>. In the New Testament it is spoken of under the name of Pertea, or beyond Jordan. Sometimes the whole trans-Jordanic territory belonging to Israel is called Gilead. In the passage before us it is the name of a city, though some take it to mean the whole land of Gilead. The men of Gilead and the Gileadites in general seem to have been fierce, wild mountaineers; and yet they are represented as still worse in this Scripture. They are nut only barbarous and wicked, but murderous and infamous for homicidal atrocities. As evidence in some sort of the justness of this dark picture, the murder of Pekahiah by Pekah with "fifty men of the Gileadites." as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>, may be specified. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is taken <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some as the feminine of the adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, crafty, cunning, wily; thus Rashi explains it: "Gilead is full of people who lie in wait for murder;" and Kimchi likewise has, "Gilead is a city of evil-doers, who are crafty to murder men." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is rather the Qal Pual participle feminine from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to seize the heel of any one, hold, tread in the footsteps, follow, go after; which is the right meaning, viz. "tracked," as given above. We retain the Authorized Version of the first clause of ver. 9, slightly modified, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">As troops of robbers wait for a man, so is the company of priests</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>, wait, being an anomalous form of the infinitive Piel for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>; thus Kimchi says, "The <span class="accented">yod</span> stands in the place of <span class="accented">he</span>, and the form is the infinitive." Both Aben Ezra and Kimchi translate the first clause as above; the former beg, "The sense is, As robber-troops wait for a man who is to pass along the way, that they may plunder him, so is (or so does) the company of the priests;" the latter explains, "As troops of robbers wait for a man passing along the way to plunder him, so is the company of priests, he means to say, as the priests of the high places who combine to plunder those who pass along the way. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> another translation, which, connecting <span class="accented">ish</span> taken collectively with <span class="accented">gedhudhim</span>, and making it the subjective genitive of the infinitive <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span>, is, "Like the lurking of the men of the gang, s is the company of the priests." This first clause is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> quite misread and not rendered by the LXX.: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "And thy strength is that of a robber: the priests have hid the way." Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> they read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, and for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> they read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;</span>. In the second clause we prefer decidedly the translation which is intimated in the margin of the Authorized Version; thus: <span class="accented">Along the way they murder even go Shechem</span>. The word <span class="accented">derekh</span> is an adverbial accusative of place; and Sichem, the present Nablus, was situated on Mount Ephraim between Ebal and Gerizim. It was a Levitical city and a city of refuge; it thus lay on the west as Gilead on the east of Jordan, and both cities, thus perhaps nearly parallel in place on opposite sides of the river, were equal in crime and infamy. The prophet does not tell us who the wayfarers were, or whither they were bound; he only intimates that they fell victims to certain miscreant priests located in these quarters. As this city lay on the main route from the north to Jerusalem, pilgrims to the annual feasts passed along this way. The priests of the calf-win, ship, being in general persons taken from the dregs of the people, waylaid those pilgrims, whether for plunder, or through hostility to the purer worship still maintained in the holy city, or from sheer cruelty. Or it is even possible that the wayfarers referred to may have been persons going from Samaria, the northern capital, to the idolatrous worship at Bethel. In either case, on the way to their destination or on the return journey they were set upon and robbed, or, in the event of resistance, they were murdered. <span class="cmt_word">For they commit lewdness;</span> rather, <span class="accented">yea, they have committed enormity</span>. The <span class="accented">zimmah</span>, or infamy, here mentioned is referred <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some to unnatural wickedness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>); it is rather <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a designation of wickedness and abominations in general; thus Kimchi explains it of "evil and abominable work of every kind." He further remarks: "The prophet says, Net this alone have they done; but all their works are <span class="accented">zimmah</span>. And perhaps <span class="accented">zimmah</span> may be explained of thought, as if he said, As they have thought in their heart so they have acted." On this verse generally it may be briefly remarked <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "by consent" of the Authorized Version would require <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;</span> to be joined with "shoulder;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the connection of the first and second clauses in the Authorized Version is much the same with that of Ewald: "And as troops lie in wait the company of priests murder along the way to Sichem." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> His explanation is that the priests murdered those that fled by the way before they reached the refuge, perhaps at the command of some leading persons ill disposed towards them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Daniel heard the voice, which according to v. 6 was like the noise of a multitude, he was stunned, and fell on his face to the ground, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>.
