Therefore the Lord sent awful messages by the prophets. The word of God will be the death either of the sin or of the sinner. God desired mercy rather than sacrifice, and that knowledge of him which produces holy fear and love. This exposes the folly of those who trust in outward observances, to make up for their want of love to God and man. As Adam broke the covenant of God in paradise, so Israel had broken his national covenant, notwithstanding all the favours they received. Judah also was ripe for Divine judgments.

Shechem too was a "city of refuge" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7</a>, and so also a city of Levites and priests <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-21.htm">John 21:21</a>. It was an important city. For there Joshua assembled all Israel for his last address to them, and made a covenant with them <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/24-1.htm">John 24:1</a>, 25. There, Rehoboam came to be accepted by Israel as their king <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1</a>, and was rejected by them. There Jeroboam after the schism, for a time, made his residence <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>. The priests were banded together; their counsel was one; they formed one company; but they were bound together as a band of robbers, not to save people's lives but to destroy them. Whereas the way to the cities of refuge was, by God's law, to be "prepared" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-3.htm">Deuteronomy 19:3</a>, clear, open, without let or hindrance to the guiltless fugitive, to save his life, the priests, the guardians of God's law, obstructed the way, to roll and destroy. They, whom God appointed to teach the truth that people might live, were banded together against His law.<p>Shechem, besides that it was a city of refuge, was also hallowed by the memory of histories of the patriarchs who walked with God. There, was Jacob's well <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5-6</a>; there Joseph's bones were buried <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>; and the memory of the patriarch Jacob was cherished there, even to the time of our Lord <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5-6</a>. Lying in a narrow valley between Mount Ebal and Gerizim, it was a witness, as it were, of the blessing and curse pronounced from them, and had, in the times of Joshua, an ancient sanctuary of God <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-26.htm">Joshua 24:26</a>. It was a halting-place for the pilgrims of the northern tribes, in their way to the feasts at Jerusalem; so that these murders by the priests coincide with the tradition of the Jews, that they who would go up to Jerusalem were murdered in the way.<p>For they commit lewdness - Literally, "For they have done deliberate sin" . The word literally means "a thing thought of," especially an evil, and so, deliberate, contrived, bethought-of, wickedness. They did deliberate wickedness, gave themselves to do it, and did nothing else. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. company&#8212;"association" or guild of priests.<p>murder by consent&#8212;literally, "with one shoulder" (compare Zep 3:9, Margin). The image is from oxen putting their shoulders together to pull the same yoke [Rivetus]. Maurer translates, "in the way towards Shechem." It was a city of refuge between Ebal and Gerizim; on Mount Ephraim (Jos 20:7; 21:21), long the civil capital of Ephraim, as Shiloh was the religious capital; now called Naploos; for a time the residence of Jeroboam (1Ki 12:25). The priests there became so corrupted that they waylaid and murdered persons fleeing to the asylum for refuge [Henderson]; the sanctity of the place enhanced the guilt of the priests who abused their priestly privileges, and the right of asylum to perpetrate murders themselves, or to screen those committed by others [Maurer].<p>commit lewdness&#8212;deliberate crime, presumptuous wickedness, from an Arabic root, "to form a deliberate purpose."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hosea/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What is here charged upon these priests, they turned highway-men and murderers, some understand of their killing and spoiling those that were going up to Jerusalem to worship God there; but more likely it is, that in this Gilead were many murderers, who durst not go out, nor could get their livelihood within the city, but, reduced to straits, took this wicked course for a livelihood, robbed and murdered on the highway, and then divided the prey with the priests, whose consent to the thing made them deeply guilty. And thus in this manner they act most lewd things; or these things are done and encouraged by the priests, because they make it their business, it is their trade now to contrive and act wickedness, highest wickednesses. Or, if you rather like it in the brief, the priests by companies lay wait, and rob, and murder, like as do the troops which rob towards Shethem. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hosea/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as troops of robbers wait for a man,.... As a gang of highwaymen or footpads lie in wait in a ditch, or under a hedge, or in a cave of a rock or mountain, for a man they know will come by that way, who is full of money, in order to rob him; or, as Saadiah interprets it, as fishermen stand upon the banks of a river, and cast in their hooks to draw out the fish; and to the same purpose is Jarchi's note from R. Meir: <p>so the company of priests murder in the way by consent; not only encourage murderers, and commit murders within the city, but go out in a body together upon the highway, and there commit murders and robberies, and divide the spoil among them; all which they did unanimously, and were well agreed, being brethren in iniquity, as well as in office: or, "in the way of Shechem" (e); as good people passed by Gilead to Shechem, and so to Jerusalem, to worship there at the solemn feasts, they lay in wait for them, and murdered them; because they did not give into the idolatrous worship of the calves at Dan and Bethel: or, "in the manner of Shechem" (f); that is, they murdered men in a deceitful treacherous manner, as the Shechemites were murdered by Simeon and Levi: Joseph Kimchi interprets this of the princes and great men, so the word "cohanim" is sometimes used; but the context seems to carry it to the priests: <p>for they commit lewdness; or "enormity"; the most enormous crimes, and that purposely, with deliberation devising and contriving them. <p>(e) "Sichemam versus", Gussetius, Schmidt; approved by Reinbeck.

The word for ‘company’ (<span class="ital">khébher</span>) implies an organized guild (such as the Pharisees afterwards), so that there was no public opinion to check the offenders. Shechem had long ago been notorious for the highway robberies committed by its inhabitants, and was therefore destroyed by Abimelech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-25.htm" title="And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.">Jdg 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-45.htm" title="And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.">Jdg 9:45</a>). It lay on the road, which was doubtless much frequented, from Samaria and the north to Bethel, now the chief sanctuary of the so-called Ten Tribes. Gilead and Shechem together represent the eastern and western divisions of the kingdom.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>According to this verse, the words of Daniel, i.e., his prayer from the first day of his seeking to understand the future, and of his self-mortification in sorrow and fasting (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>), was heard of God, and the angel was immediately sent forth by God to convey to him revelations. And, he adds, &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, I am come for thy words, i.e., in consequence of thy prayer, according to it. The &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; most interpreters understand of the coming to Daniel; Hofmann (Schriftbew. i. p. 331) and Kliefoth, on the contrary, understand it of the coming of the angel to Persia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>). According to the matter, both views are correct, but in the form in which they are presented they are incorrect. Against the latter stands the adversative  &#1493;in &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (but the prince), <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, by which the contents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a> are introduced; for, according to this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a> cannot represent the object of the coming. Against the former stands the fact, that the angel does not come to Daniel immediately, but only after having gained a victory over the prince of the kingdom. The &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; is again taken up in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>, and must have here the same meaning that it has there. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a> it is connected with &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;, "I am come to bring thee understanding," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a> with &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, which only denotes that the "coming" corresponded to Daniel's prayer, but not that he came immediately to him. Daniel had, without doubt, prayed for the accomplishment of the salvation promised to his people, and eo ipso for the removal of all the hindrances that stood in the way of that accomplishment. The hearing of his prayer may be regarded, therefore, as containing in it not merely the fact that God directed an angel to convey to him disclosures regarding the future fortunes of his people, but also at the same time as implying that on the side of God steps were taken for the removal of these hindrances.<p>The thirteenth verse speaks of this, not as denoting that the angel came to Persia for the purpose of working for Israel, but much rather as announcing the reason of the twenty-one days' delay in the coming of the angel to Daniel, in the form of a parenthetical clause. His coming to Daniel was hindered by this, that the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood him twenty-one days. The twenty-one days are those three weeks of Daniel's fasting and prayer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a>. Hence we see that the coming of the angel had its reference to Daniel, for he came to bring him a comforting answer from God; but in order that he might be able to do this, he must first, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, enter into war with and overcome the spirit of the king of Persia, hostile to the people of God. The contents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a> are hence not to be understood as showing that the angel went to Persia in order that he might there arrange the cause of Israel with the king; the verse much rather speaks of a war in the kingdom of the supernatural spirits, which could not relate to the court of the king of Persia. The prince (&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;) of the kingdom of Persia, briefly designated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a> "the prince of Persia," is not king Cyrus, or the collectivum of the kings of Persia, as Hv. and Kran., with Calvin and most of the Reformers, think, but the guardian spirit or the protecting genius of the Persian kingdom, as the Rabbis and most of the Christian interpreters have rightly acknowledged. For the angel that appeared to Daniel did not fight with the kings of Persia, but with a spiritual intelligence of a like nature, for the victory, or precedence with the kings of Persia. This spirit of the kingdom of Persia, whom, after the example of Jerome, almost all interpreters call the guardian angel of his kingdom, is as little the nature-power of this kingdom as Michael is the nature-power of Israel, but is a spirit-being; yet not the heathen national god of the Persians, but, according to the view of Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>.), the &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; of the Persian kingdom, i.e., the supernatural spiritual power standing behind the national gods, which we may properly call the guardian spirit of this kingdom. In the &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; lies, according to the excellent remark of Kliefoth, the idea, that "the &#1513;&#1474;&#1512; of the kingdom of Persian stood beside the kings of the Persians to influence them against Israel, and to direct against Israel the power lying in Persian heathendom, so as to support the insinuations of the Samaritans; that the angel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>, came on account of Daniel's prayer to dislodge this 'prince' from his position and deprive him of his influence, but he kept his place for twenty-one days, till Michael came to his help; then he so gained the mastery over him, that he now stood in his place beside the kings of Persia, so as henceforth to influence them in favour of Israel." He who appeared to Daniel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>, and spake with him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-11.htm">Daniel 10:11</a>, is not "the angel who had his dominion among the nations of the world," or "his sphere of action in the embodiments of the heathen world-power, to which the Jewish people were now in subjection, to promote therein the working out of God's plan of salvation" (Hofm. Schriftbew. i. p. 334). This supposition is destitute of support from the Scriptures. It is rather the Angel of the Lord who carries out God's plans in the world, and for their accomplishment and execution makes war against the hostile spirit of the heathen world-power. The subjugation of this spirit supposes a particular angel ruling in the heathen world just as little as Jehovah's contending against the heathen nations that oppress and persecute His kingdom and people.<p>In the war against the hostile spirit of the kingdom of Persia, the archangel Michael came to the help of the Angel of the Lord. The name &#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500;, who is as God, comes into view, as does the name Gabriel, only according to the appellative signification of the word, and expresses, after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>., the idea of God's unparalleled helping power. Michael is thus the angel possessing the unparalleled power of God. He is here said to be "one of the chief princes," i.e., of the highest angel-princes, - <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>, "your prince," i.e., the prince who contends for Israel, who conducts the cause of Israel. The first title points undoubtedly to an arrangement of orders and degrees among the angels, designating Michael as one of the most distinguished of the angel-princes; hence called in Jde 1:9 &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>, where he is represented as contending with his angels against the dragon. The opinion that Michael is called "one of the chief princes," not as in contrast with the angels, but only with the demons of the heathen gods (Kliefoth), is opposed by the words themselves and by the context. From the circumstance that the guardian spirit of Persia is called &#1513;&#1474;&#1512; it does not follow that &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is not a designation of the angels generally, but only of the princes of the people, who are the spirits ruling in the social affairs of nations and kingdoms (Hofmann, p. 337); and even though this conclusion may be granted, this meaning for &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; with the article and the predicate &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is undemonstrable. For the Scripture does not place the demon-powers of heathendom so on a line with the angels that both are designated as &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. The &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; can only be the princes, chiefs, of the good angels remaining in communion with God, and working for the kingdom of God. Though what is said by the angel Michael, for the sake of the Israelitish people, among whom he has the sphere of his activity, may be said for their comfort, yet it does not follow therefrom that that which is said "cannot give disclosures regarding the relation within the angel-world, but only regarding the relation to the great historical nations and powers of the world" (Hofm. p. 338). For as regards the statement adduced in support of this opinion - "the greatness and importance of the work entrusted to him makes him one of the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, not that the work is entrusted to him because he is so" - just the contrary is true. To a subordinate spirit God will not entrust a work demanding special power and greatness; much rather the being entrusted with a great and important work supposes a man exalted above the common mass. And for the comforting of Israel the words, "Michael, one of the foremost princes, came to my help," affirm that Israel is under very powerful protection, because its guardian spirit is one of the foremost of the angel-princes, whereby implic. it is said at the same time that the people, though they be little esteemed before the world, yet cannot be destroyed by the nations of the world. This thought follows as a conclusion from what is said regarding the dignity of their guardian angel, but it does not form the contents of the saying regarding Michael and his place among the heavenly spirits.<p>But we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a> the reason why the archangel Michael, and no other angel, came to the help of him who was clothed with linen. It was because Michael was the prince of Israel, i.e., "the high angel-prince who had to maintain the cause of the people of God in the invisible spirit-world against opposing powers" (Auberlen, p. 289); and as such he appears also in Jde 1:9 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>. The coming of Michael to give help does not include in it this, that he was superior in might or in position to the angel that spake, and thus supplies no proof that the angel that spake was Gabriel, or an angel different from him who was clothed with linen. For even a subordinate servant can bring help to his master, and in a conflict render him aid in gaining the victory. Against the idea of the subjection of Michael to the angel that spake, or the man clothed with linen, stands the further unfolding of the angel's message, the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-1.htm">Daniel 11:1</a>, according to which the angel that spake gave strength and help to Michael in the first year of the Median Darius, from which we have more reason to conclude that the angel who spake stood above the angel Michael; see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-1.htm">Daniel 11:1</a>.<p>In consequence of the assistance on the part of Michael, the Angel of the Lord obtained the place of superiority by the side of the king of Persia. &#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512; has not here the usual meaning, to be over and above, to remain, but is to be translated after &#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>, to have the pre-eminence, to excel, in the passive signification of the Hiphil: "to be provided with the preference, to gain the superiority." The translation, "I have maintained the place" (Hofm.), cannot be proved. &#1488;&#1510;&#1500;, at the side of, near, is explained from the idea of the protecting spirit standing by the side of his protege. The plural, "kings of Persia," neither refers to Cyrus and Cambyses, nor to Cyrus and the conquered kings living with him (Croesus, etc.), nor to Cyrus and the prince, i.e., his guardian spirit (Hitzig). The plural denotes, that by the subjugation of the demon of the Persian kingdom, his influence not merely over Cyrus, but over all the following kings of Persia, was brought to an end, so that the whole of the Persian kings became accessible to the influence of the spirit proceeding from God and advancing the welfare of Israel. </body></html>
