The Lord’s “controversy” repudiates the entire priesthood, as they had rejected the true knowledge of God. They had inclined to calf-worship, had been vacillating respecting Baal, and had connived at moral offences. If, on the other hand, with most commentators, we consider the people themselves as thus addressed, the passage refers to the cessation of the position of priesthood, which every member of the true theocracy ought to have maintained. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.

They forgot the law of God, neither desired nor endeavoured to retain it in mind, and to transmit the remembrance to their posterity; therefore God will justly forget them and their children. If we dishonour God with that which is our honour, it will, sooner or later, be turned into shame to us. Instead of warning the people against sin, from the consideration of the sacrifices, which showed what an offence sin was to God, since it needed an atonement, the priests encouraged the people to sin, since atonement might be made at so small an expense. It is very wicked to be pleased with the sins of others, because they may turn to our advantage. What is unlawfully gained, cannot be comfortably used. The people and the priests hardened one another in sin; therefore justly shall they share in the punishment. Sharers in sin must expect to share in ruin. Any lust harboured in the heart, in time will eat out all its strength and vigour. That is the reason why many professors grow so heavy, so dull, so dead in the way of religion. They have a liking for some secret lust, which takes away their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge - "My people are," not, "is." This accurately represents the Hebrew . The word "people" speaks of them as a whole; are, relates to the individuals of whom that whole is composed. Together, the words express the utter destruction of the whole, one and all. They are destroyed "for lack of knowledge," literally, "of the knowledge," i. e., the only knowledge, which in the creature is real knowledge, that knowledge, of the want of which he had before complained, the knowledge of the Creator. So Isaiah mourns in the same words , "therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>. They are destroyed for lack of it, for the true knowledge of God is the life of the soul, true life, eternal life, as our Saviour saith, "This is life eternal, that they should know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou has sent." The source of this lack of knowledge, so fatal to the people, was the willful rejection of that knowledge by the priest;<p>Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to Me - God marks the relation between the sin and the punishment, by retorting on them, as it were, their own acts; and that with great emphasis, "I will utterly reject thee . Those, thus addressed, must have been true priests, scattered up and down in Israel, who, in an irregular way, offered sacrifices for them, and connived at their sins. For God's sentence on them is, "thou shalt be no priest to me." But the priests whom Jeroboam consecrated out of other tribes than Levi, were priests not to God, but to the calves. Those then, originally true priests to God, had probably a precarious livelihood, when the true worship of God was deformed by the mixture of the calf-worship, and the people "halted between two opinions;" and so were tempted by poverty also, to withhold from the people unpalatable truth. They shared, then, in the rejection of God's truth which they dissembled, and made themselves partakers in its suppression. And now, they "despised, were disgusted" with  the knowledge of God, as all do in fact despise and dislike it, who prefer ought besides to it. So God repaid their contempt to them, and took away the office, which, by their sinful connivances, they had hoped to retain.<p>Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God - This seems to have been the sin of the people. For the same persons could not, at least in the same stage of sin, despise and forget. They who despise or "reject," must have before their mind that which they "reject." To reject is willful, conscious, deliberate sin, with a high hand; to "forget," an act of negligence. The rejection of God's law was the act of the understanding and will, forgetfulness of it comes from the neglect to look into it; and this, from the distaste of the natural mind for spiritual things, from being absorbed in things of this world, from inattention to the duties prescribed by it, or shrinking from seeing "that" condemned, which is agreeable to the flesh. The priests knew God's law and "despised" it; the people "forgat" it. In an advanced stage of sin, however, man may come to forget what he once despised; and this is the condition of the hardened sinner.<p>I will also forget thy children - Literally, "I will forget thy children, I too." God would mark the more, that His act followed on their's; they, first; then, He saith, "I too." He would requite them, and do what it belonged not to His Goodness to do first. Parents who are careless as to themselves, as to their own lives, even as to their own shame, still long that their children should not be as themselves. God tries to touch their hearts, where they are least steeled against Him. He says not, "I will forget thee," but I will forget those nearest thy heart, "thy children." God is said to forget, when He acts, as if His creatures were no longer in His mind, no more. the objects of His providence and love. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. lack of knowledge&#8212;"of God" (Ho 4:1), that is, lack of piety.

This is not to be understood of those who are the Lord's people by special grace; for they cannot he destroyed, at least with everlasting destruction; God's love to them, his choice of them, covenant with them, the redemption of them by Christ, and the grace of God in them, secure them from such destruction: nor can they perish through want of knowledge; for though they are by nature as ignorant as others, yet it is the determinate will of God to bring them to the knowledge of the truth, in order to salvation; and that same decree which fixes salvation as the end, secures the belief of the truth as the means; and the covenant of grace provides for their knowledge of spiritual things, as well as other spiritual blessings; in consequence of which their minds are enlightened by the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, and they have the knowledge of God and Christ given them, which is life eternal. But this is to he understood of the people of the ten tribes of Israel, who were nationally and nominally the people of God, were so by profession; they called themselves the people of God; and though they were idolaters, yet they professed to worship God in their idols; and as yet God's "loammi" had not taken place upon them; he still sent his prophets among them, to reprove and reform them, and they were not as yet finally rejected by him, and cast out of their land. These may be said to be "destroyed", because they were threatened with destruction, and it was near at hand, they were just upon the brink of it; and because of the certainty of it, and this "through the lack of knowledge": either in the people, who were ignorant of God, his mind, and will, and worship, and without fear and reverence of him, which was the cause of all the abominations they ran into, for which they were threatened with ruin; or in the priests, whose business it was to teach and instruct the people; but instead of teaching them true doctrine, and the true, manner of worship, taught them false doctrine, and led them into superstition and idolatry; and so they perished through the default of the priests in performing their office; which sense is confirmed by what follows: <p>because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shall be no priest to me; the priests that Jeroboam made were of the lowest of the people, ignorant and illiterate men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a> and they chose to continue such; they rejected with contempt and abhorrence, as the word signifies, the knowledge of God, and of all divine things; of the law of God, concerning what was to be done, or not to be done, by the people; and of all statutes and ordinances relating to divine worship, and the performance of the priestly office: and though there might be some of Aaron's line that continued in the land of Israel, and in their office; yet these affected the same ignorance, and therefore the Lord threatens them with a rejection from the priesthood; or, however, that they should be no priests to him, or in his account, but should be had in the utmost abhorrence and contempt, The word here used has a letter in it more than usual (s), which may signify the utter rejection of them, and the great contempt they were had in by the Lord; this was to take place, and did, at the captivity by Shalmaneser. <p>Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God: which he had given them, who was their God by profession; and which they had forgot as if they never had read or learnt it; and so as not to observe and keep it themselves, nor teach and instruct others in it: <p>I will also forget thy children; have no regard to them, take no notice and care of them, as if they were never known by him; meaning either the people in general, their disciples and spiritual children; or else their natural children, who should be cut off, and not succeed them in the priesthood. The words are very emphatic, "I will forget them, even I" (t); which expresses the certainty of it more fully, as well as more clearly points at the justness of the retaliation. <p>(s)  the last is superfluous; the reason of the word being so written.

There is no reason to think that the ‘priest-people’ of Israel is addressed; there was no priest-people till after the return from exile.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">forgotten … forget</span>] To ‘forget’ what has been committed to one’s charge is the same as to ignore it. The penalty of the priests is not really distinct from that of the people (see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-9.htm" title="And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.">Hosea 4:9</a></span>); the priestly office could in no full sense be maintained in captivity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the law of thy God</span>] ‘Thy God’, because the priest was specially ‘brought near’ to Jehovah. ‘The law’, Heb. <span class="ital">tôrâh</span>, will cover oral as well as written instructions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm" title="According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do: you shall not decline from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>), but a later passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-12.htm" title="I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.">Hosea 8:12</a>) shows that a written legislation existed in Hosea’s time.

The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d5;</span> is rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by Jerome in the sense of "silence:" "conticuit populus incus," which he explains to mean "sinking into eternal silence." So also the Chaldee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX., understands it in the sense of "likeness:" "My people are like (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) as if they had no knowledge." Aben Ezra disproves this sense as follows: "This word, if it were from the root signifying 'likeness,' would have after it <span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">seghol</span>, as, 'To [<span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">seghol</span>] whom art thou like in thy greatness?' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-2.htm">Ezekiel 31:2</a>); but without the word <span class="accented">el</span> it has the meaning of ' cutting off.'" So Kimchi: "Here also it has the sense of  'cutting off.'" The article before "knowledge" implies renewed mention and refers to the word in ver. 1; or it may emphasize the word as that knowledge by way of eminence, which surpasses all other knowledge, and without which no other knowledge can really prove a blessing in the end. The knowledge of God is the most excellent of all sciences. Paul counted all things but loss in comparison with its possession; and our blessed Lord himself says, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent;" while the Prophet Isaiah attributed the captivity to its absence: "My people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge." <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast rejected knowledge... seeing thou hast forgotten the Law of thy Son.</span> The cause of this ignorance is here charged on the unfaithfulness of the priesthood. They rejected knowledge and forgot the Law of their God. The two concluding clauses of this verse may be regarded as "split members" of a single sentence. As rejection implies the presence of the object rejected, while forgetfulness implies its absence from the mind or memory, some have understood rejection of knowledge as the sin of the priest, and forgetfulness that of the people. This separation is not necessary, for what men continue for a time to despise they will by-and-by forget. The forgetfulness is thus an advance upon rejection. The sin of these priests was very great, for, while the priests' lips were required to keep knowledge, they neither preserved that knowledge themselves nor promoted it among the people; hence the indignant and direct address. Thus Kimchi says: "He addresses the priestly order that existed at that time: Thou hast rejected he knowledge for thyself and to teach it to the people, consequently I will reject thee from being a priest unto me. Since thou dost not exercise the office of priest, which is to teach the Law, I will reject thee so that thou shalt not be a priest in my house." <span class="cmt_word">I will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me... I will also forget thy children, even I.</span> The punishment resembles the offence; the human delinquency is reflected in the Divine retaliation. To make this the more pointed, the "thou on thy part (<span class="accented">attah</span>)" at the head of the sentence has its counterpart, or rather is counterbalanced by the "even I" or "I too (<span class="accented">gam ani</span>)" at its close. The severity of the punishment is augmented by the threat that, not only the then existing priests, but their sons after them, would be excluded from the honor of the priesthood. This was touching painfully the tenderest part. It needs scarcely be observed that forgetfulness is only spoken of God in a figurative sense, and after the manner of men, that being forgotten which is no longer the object of attention or affection. "The meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>," says Kimchi, "is by way of figure, like the man who forgets something and does not take it to heart." The unusual form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span> has been variously accounted for. The Massorites mark the <span class="accented">aleph</span> before <span class="accented">caph</span> as redundant; it is omitted in several manuscripts of Kennicott and De Rossi, as also some of the early printed editions. Kimchi confesses his ignorance of its use. Olshausen treats it as a copyist's error; but Ewald "regards it as an Aram-seen pausal form." Some take the reference to be to Israel as a kingdom of priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>) rather than to the actual priesthood. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Daniel's prayer.

But if we consider this dependence more closely, we shall, it is true, find the expression &#1492;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; (confusion of faces, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7</a>, but we also find it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-21.htm">2 Chronicles 32:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-19.htm">Jeremiah 7:19</a>, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-16.htm">Psalm 44:16</a>; &#1505;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (forgivenesses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-9.htm">Daniel 9:9</a>) we find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>; and &#1506;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; (is poured upon, spoken of the anger of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>) is found not only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-7.htm">2 Chronicles 12:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-21.htm">2 Chronicles 34:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-25.htm">2 Chronicles 34:25</a>, but also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-6.htm">Jeremiah 44:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>. We have only to examine the other parallel common thoughts and words adduced in order at once to perceive that, without exception, they all have their roots in the Pentateuch, and afford not the slightest proof of the dependence of this chapter on <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a>.<p>The thought, "great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy," etc., which is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4</a> and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, has its roots in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-21.htm">Deuteronomy 7:21</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-9.htm">Daniel 9:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>, and in the form found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Nehemiah 9:32</a>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; the expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15</a>), "Thou hast brought Thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand," has its origin in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26</a>, etc. But in those verses where single thoughts or words of this prayer so accord with <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a> or <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-15</a> as to show a dependence, a closer comparison will prove, not that Daniel borrows from Ezra or Nehemiah, but that they borrow from Daniel. This is put beyond a doubt by placing together the phrases: "our kings, our princes, our fathers" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-8.htm">Daniel 9:8</a>), compared with these: "our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-34.htm">Nehemiah 9:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Nehemiah 9:32</a>), and "our kings and our priests" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7</a>). For here the naming of the "priests" along with the "kings and princes" is just as characteristic of the age of Ezra and Nehemiah as the omission of the "priests" is of the time of the Exile, in which, in consequence of the cessation of worship, the office of the priest was suspended. This circumstance tends to refute the argument of Sthelin (Einl. p. 349), that since the prayers in Chron., Ezra, and Nehem. greatly resemble each other, and probably proceed from one author, it is more likely that the author of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a> depended on the most recent historical writings, than that <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a> was always before the eyes of the author of Chron. - a supposition the probability of which is not manifest.<p>If, without any preconceived opinion that this book is a product of the times of the Maccabees, the contents and the course of thought found in the prayer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>, are compared with the prayers in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-15</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a>, we will not easily suppose it possible that Daniel depends on Ezra and Nehemiah. The prayer of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6-15</a> is a confession of the sins of the congregation from the days of the fathers down to the time of Ezra, in which Ezra scarcely ventures to raise his countenance to God, because as a member of the congregation he is borne down by the thought of their guilt; and therefore he does not pray for pardon, because his design is only "to show to the congregation how greatly they had gone astray, and to induce them on their part to do all to atone for their guilt, and to turn away the anger of God" (Bertheau).<p>The prayer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6-37</a>, is, after the manner of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a> and 106, an extended offering of praise for all the good which the Lord had manifested toward His people, notwithstanding that they had continually hardened their necks and revolted from His from the time of the call of Abraham down to the time of the exile, expressing itself in the confession, "God is righteous, but we are guilty," never rising to a prayer for deliverance from bondage, under which the people even then languished.<p>The prayer of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>, on the contrary, by its contents and form, not only creates the impression "of a fresh production adapted to the occasion," and also of great depth of thought and of earnest power in prayer, but it presents itself specially as the prayer of a man, a prophet, standing in a near relation to God, so that we perceive that the suppliant probably utters the confession of sin and of guilt in the name of the congregation in which he is included; but in the prayer for the turning away of God's anger his special relation to the Lord is seen, and is pleaded as a reason for his being heard, in the words, "Hear the prayer of Thy servant and his supplication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-17.htm">Daniel 9:17</a>); O my God, incline Thine ear" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>).<p>(Note: After the above remarks, Ewald's opinion, that this prayer is only an epitome of the prayer of Baruch (1:16-3:8), scarcely needs any special refutation. It is open before our eyes, and has been long known, that the prayer of Baruch in the whole course of its thoughts, and in many of the expressions found in it, fits closely to the prayer of Daniel; but also all interpreters not blinded by prejudice have long ago acknowledged that from the resemblances of this apocryphal product not merely to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>, but also much more to Jeremiah, nothing further follows than that the author of this late copy of ancient prophetic writings knew and used the book of Daniel, and was familiar with the writings of Daniel and Jeremiah, and of other prophets, so that he imitated them. This statement, that the pseudo-Baruch in ch. 1:15-3:8 presents an extended imitation of Daniel's prayer, Ewald has not refuted, and he has brought forward nothing more in support of his view than the assertion, resting on the groundless supposition that the mention of the "judges" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-12.htm">Daniel 9:12</a> is derived from Bar. 2:1, and on the remark that the author of the book of Baruch would have nothing at all peculiar if he had formed that long prayer out of the book of Daniel, or had only wrought after this pattern - a remark which bears witness, indeed, of a compassionate concern for his protge, but manifestly says nothing for the critic.)<p>The prayer is divided into two parts. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4-14</a> contain the confession of sin and guilt; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15-19</a> the supplication for mercy, and the restoration of the holy city and its sanctuary lying in ruins.<p>The confession of sin divides itself into two strophes. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4-10</a> state the transgression and the guilt, while <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11-14</a> refer to the punishment from God for this guilt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a> forms the introduction. The words, "Then I directed my face to the Lord," are commonly understood, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-11.htm">Daniel 6:11</a>, as meaning that Daniel turned his face toward the place of the temple, toward Jerusalem. This is possible. The words themselves, however, only say that he turned his face to God the Lord in heaven, to &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, the Lord of the whole world, the true God, not to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, although he meant the covenant God. "To seek prayer in (with) fasting," etc. "Fasting in sackcloth (penitential garment made of hair) and ashes," i.e., sprinkling the head with ashes as an outward sign of true humility and penitence, comes into consideration as a means of preparation for prayer, in order that one might place himself in the right frame of mind for prayer, which is an indispensable condition for the hearing of it - a result which is the aim in the seeking. In regard to this matter Jerome makes these excellent remarks: "In cinere igitur et sacco postulat impleri quod Deus promiserat, non quod esset incredulus futurorum, sed ne securitas negligentiam et negligentia pareret offensam." &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-38.htm">1 Kings 8:38</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-45.htm">1 Kings 8:45</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-49.htm">1 Kings 8:49</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-29.htm">2 Chronicles 6:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-35.htm">2 Chronicles 6:35</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is prayer in general; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, prayer for mercy and compassion, as also a petition for something, such as the turning away of misfortune or evil (deprecari). The design of the prayer lying before us is to entreat God that He would look with pity on the desolation of the holy city and the temple,and fulfil His promise of their restoration. This prayer is found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15-19</a>.</body></html>
