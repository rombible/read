This would lead to disorder and sin. Thus men prepare scourges for themselves, and vice is spread through a people. Let not Judah come near the idolatrous worship of Israel. For Israel was devoted to idols, and must now be let alone. When sinners cast off the easy yoke of Christ, they go on in sin till the Lord saith, Let them alone. Then they receive no more warnings, feel no more convictions: Satan takes full possession of them, and they ripen for destruction. It is a sad and sore judgment for any man to be let alone in sin. Those who are not disturbed in their sin, will be destroyed for their sin. May we be kept from this awful state; for the wrath of God, like a strong tempest, will soon hurry impenitent sinners into ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will not punish your daughters - God threatens, as the severest woe, that He will not punish their sins with the correction of a Father in this present life, but will leave the sinners, unheeded, to follow all iniquity. It is the last punishment of persevering stoners, that God leaves them to prosper in their sins and in those things which help them to sin. Hence, we are taught to pray, "O Lord, correct me, but in judgment, not in Thine anger" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>. For since God chastiseth those whom He loveth, it follows, "if we be without chasetisement, whereof all are partakers, then are we bastards, and not sons" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-8.htm">Hebrews 12:8</a>. To be chastened severely for lesser sins, is a token of great love of God toward us; to sin on without punishment is a token of God's extremest displeasure, and a sign of reprobation. : "Great is the offence, if, when thou hast sinned, thou art undeserving of the wrath of God."<p>For themselves are separated with whores - God turns from them as unworthy to be spoken to anymore, and speaks of them, They "separate themselves," from whom? and with whom? They separate themselves "from" God, and with the degraded ones and "with" devils. Yet so do all those who choose willful sin.<p>And they sacrifice - (continually, as before) with (the) harlots The unhappy women here spoken of were such as were  "consecrated" (as their name imports) to their vile gods and goddesses, and to prostitution. This dreadful consecration, yea desecration, whereby they were taught to seek honor in their disgrace, was spread in different forms over Phoenicia, Syria, Phrygia, Assyria, Babylonia. Ashtaroth, (the Greek Astarte) was its chief object. This horrible worship prevailed in Midian, when Israel was entering the promised land, and it suggested the devilish device of Balaam <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a> to entangle Israel in sin whereby they might forfeit the favor of God. The like is said to subsist to this day in pagan India. The sin was both the cause and effect of the superstition. Man's corrupt heart gave rise to the worship: and the worship in turn fostered the corruption. He first sanctioned the sin by aid of a degrading worship of nature, and then committed it under plea of that worship. He made his sin a law to him. Women, who never relapsed into the sin, sinned in obedience to the dreadful law . Blinded as they were, individual pagan had the excuse of their hereditary blindness; the Jews had imperfect grace. The sins of Christians are self sought, against light and grace.<p>Therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall - The word comprises both, "that doth not understand," and, "that will not understand." They might have understood, if they would. God had revealed Himself to them, and had given to them His law, and was still sending to them His prophets, so that they could not have known and understood God's will, had they willed. Ignorance, which we might avoid or cure, if we would, is itself a sin. It cannot excuse sin. They shall, he says, fall, "or be cast headlong." Those who blind their eyes, so as not to see or understand God's will, bring themselves to sudden ruin, which hide from themselves, until they fall headlong in it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Either not punish them at all, so that they shall go on in sin, and to a greater degree, to the disgrace and reproach of their parents and husbands; or not as yet, or not so severely in them, because it was by their example they were led into it. Jarchi's note is very impertinent, that God threatens them with the disuse of the bitter waters of jealousy. The words are by some rendered interrogatively, "shall I not punish your daughters?" &amp;c. (r); verily I will; and not them only, but their parents and husbands too, who deserve more severe corrections: <p>for themselves are separated with whores, and sacrifice with harlots; they separated themselves to Baalpeor, that shameful idol, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, the Priapus of the Gentiles, in whose idolatrous worship many obscene rites were used; these men separated themselves from their wives, as well as from God and his worship, and from the company and conversation of men, and in private committed uncleanness with the women that attended, and with the female priests that officiated at the worship of idols; those "sanctified" ones, as the word may be rendered; and after that ate of things offered to idols with them. So the Targum, <p>"they associated themselves with whores, and ate and drank with harlots.'' <p>Some versions understand the latter of catamites, or sodomitical persons, and of the wickedness practised by them in such places. <p>Therefore the people that doth not understand; the law, as the Targum; what is to be done, and what to be avoided; the difference between the true and false religion; have no knowledge of divine and spiritual things, at least are very wavering and unsettled in their minds about religion, having thought little, and know less, of the matter: <p>shall fall: into idolatry and adultery, led by such examples. So the Septuagint version, "is implicated with a whore"; or "embraces a whore", as the Syriac and Arabic versions; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22</a> or shall fall into calamities, ruin, and destruction; shall be dashed, as the Targum; so the Arabic interpreter of <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-26.htm">Mark 9:26</a>, uses the word: though Aben Ezra and Kimchi say, that in the Arabic language it signifies to be perplexed and disturbed, so as not to know what to do (s). The first sense seems to be best, of being scandalized, offended, and stumbling and falling into sin; and which Abarbinel suggests, and it agrees with what follows concerning Judah. <p>(r) So Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Schmidt.

Their own dishonor and disgrace, through the unfaithfulness of persons so near to them, would impress them with a sense of the dishonor done to God, the spiritual Husband of his people; their feeling of pain and shame in consequence would convey to them a clearer notion of the abhorrence which their offences had occasioned to God. But their punishment would become more severe, and their pain intensified by the Divine refusal to avenge them by punishing the lewdness that caused such dishonor. While punishment would prevent the sin and consequent reproach, impunity, or the postponement of punishment, would leave the offenders to go on in their course of sin and shame. Aben Ezra comments on this fourteenth verse as follows: "The sense is - It is not to be wondered at if the daughters commit whoredom; for they themselves, when they go up to the tops of the mountains to burn incense, eat and drink with harlots and commit whoredom - all of them. And, behold, the sense is, not that he shall not punish them at all, but he speaks in regard to, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in comparison with, the fathers; for they teach them to commit whoredom doing according to their works. Perhaps the daughters are still little, therefore I shall not punish." Rashi thinks that this threatening refers to the disuse of the bitter waters of jealousy, so that suspected guilt could not be detected. But there is nothing to intimate such a reference; nor would it be in keeping with the scope of the passage. Again, some, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, read the words, not indicatively, but interrogatively - "Shall I not punish," etc.? This would require such a meaning to be read into the passage as the following: "Assuredly I shall punish them; and not the daughters and daughters-in-law only, but the parents and husbands still more severely, because of their greater criminality." Equally unsatisfactory is the explanation of Theodoret, who, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> in a good sense, which it has with the accusative, understands it of God's refusing any protection or preservation of their daughters and spouses from outrage at the hands of a hostile soldiery, so that such sins as they themselves had been guilty in private, would be committed with the females of their family in public. <span class="cmt_word">For they themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots.</span> The change of person appears to imply that God turns away with inexpressible disgust from such vileness, and, turning aside to a third party, explains the grounds of his procedure. The <span class="accented">Qedesheth</span> were females who devoted themselves to licentiousness in the service of Ashtaroth, the Sidonian Venus. Persons of this description were attached to idol temples and idolatrous worship in heathen lands in ancient times, as in India at the present time. The 'Speaker's Commentary' calls them "devotee-harlots," and cites an allusion to the custom from the Moabite Stone, as follows: "I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-kemosh." After stating the humiliating fact that fathers and husbands in Israel, instead of uniting with their wives in the worship of Jehovah, separated themselves, going aside with these female idolaters for the purpose of lewdness, and shared in their sacrificial feasts, the prophet, or rather God by the prophet, impatient of the recital of such shameless licentiousness, and indignant at such presumptuous sinning, closes abruptly with the declaration of the recklessness, and denunciation of the ruin of all such offenders, in the words  - <span class="cmt_word">the people that doth not understand shall fall</span>; margin, be <span class="accented">punished</span>; rather, <span class="accented">dashed to the ground</span>, or <span class="accented">plunge into ruin</span> (<span class="accented">nilbat</span>). Both Aben Ezra and Kimchi give from the Arabic, as an alternative sense of <span class="accented">silbat</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> fall into error. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; with &#1493; consec.: therefore has the curse poured itself out, and the oath, i.e., the curse strengthened with an oath. &#1504;&#1514;&#1498;, to pour forth, of storms of rain and hail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-33.htm">Exodus 9:33</a>), but especially of the destroying fire-rain of the divine wrath, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-6.htm">Jeremiah 44:6</a>. &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; is used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>., of the threatenings against the transgressors of the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>., to which Daniel here makes reference.
