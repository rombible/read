The Hebrew word, <span class="greekheb">אלה</span>, here used, is rendered <span class="greekheb">αρα </span>by the LXX., that is, <span class="ital">execration, imprecation, </span>or <span class="ital">cursing, </span>as Bishop Horsley renders it. Profane swearing, however, or taking the name of God in vain, is doubtless included. The next word, <span class="greekheb">כחשׁ</span>, rendered <span class="ital">lying, </span>means falsehood in general: and especially, as some think, the denying of deposites which had been left in their hands, and which, when the owners came to claim them, they absolutely denied having received. And <span class="ital">killing, </span>committing murders, either privately or with open violence. <span class="ital">They break out — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">פרצו</span>, <span class="ital">they burst out, </span>or <span class="ital">overflow, </span>a metaphor taken from rivers breaking their banks, and bearing down every obstacle by the impetuosity of their waters. The meaning is, There is an inundation of all manner of wickedness, and all law and equity is broken through and violated. <span class="ital">And blood toucheth blood — </span>One murder follows upon another, and many are committed in all parts of the country, and as it were, in a constant series and succession. This was probably spoken with an especial reference to the murder of their kings by those who aspired to succeed them; as Zechariah by Shallum, Shallum by Menahem, Pekah by Pekahiah and Hoshea. In such civil broils a great many of their friends and dependants are commonly slain with the kings themselves.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 Hosea reproves for immorality, as well as idolatry.

Our sins, as separate persons, as a family, as a neighbourhood, as a nation, cause the Lord to have a controversy with us; let us submit and humble ourselves before Him, that he may not go on to destroy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hosea/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By swearing, and lying ... - Literally, "swearing or cursing" , "and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery!" The words in Hebrew are nouns of action. The Hebrew form is very vivid and solemn. It is far more forcible than if he had said, "They swear, lie, kill, and steal." It expresses that these sins were continual, that nothing else (so to speak) was going on; that it was all one scene of such sins, one course of them, and of nothing besides; as we say more familiarly, "It was all, swearing, lying, killing, stealing, committing adultery." It is as if the prophet, seeing with a sight above nature, a vision from God, saw, as in a picture, what was going on, all around, within and without, and summed up in this brief picture, all which he saw. This it was and nothing but this, which met his eyes, wherever he looked, whatever he heard, "swearing, lying, killing, stealing, committing adultery." The prophet had before said, that the ten tribes were utterly lacking in all truth, all love, all knowledge of God. But where there are none of these, "there," in all activity, will be the contrary vices. When the land or the soul is empty of the good, it will be full of the evil. "They break out," i. e., burst through all bounds, set to restrain them, as a river bursts its banks and overspreads all things or sweeps all before it. "And blood toucheth blood," literally, "bloods touch bloods" . The blood was poured so continuously and in such torrents, that it flowed on, until stream met stream and formed one wide inundation of blood. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hosea/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. they break out&#8212;bursting through every restraint.<p>blood toucheth blood&#8212;literally, "bloods."

Possibly the wrong done by the adulterer was (as Ammon’s) revenged with the slaughter of the adulterer; or possibly it may refer to murders committed in the very court of the temple; so the blood of the murdered touched the blood of sacrifices. It is too particular to refer it to the blood of Zechariah slain between the porch and the altar, and which (some say) ran down to the altar and touched the blood of the sacrifice. Or what if this should refer to what will be ere long, when Jeroboam is dead, when Zachariah is murdered by Shallum, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-10.htm" title="And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.">2 Kings 15:10</a></span>; Menahem slew Shallum, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-14.htm" title="For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.">2 Kings 15:14</a></span>, and ripped up women with child in Tiphsah, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-16.htm" title="Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.">2 Kings 15:16</a></span>; when Pekah slew Pekahiah, and Hoshea slew him? These kings being thus slain, no doubt much blood was spilt; all which happened in less than forty years; for from Zechariah to Pekah’s usurpation are but fourteen years, from Pekah’s entrance on the throne to Hoshea’s conspiracy are twenty years. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hosea/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>By swearing, and lying,.... Which some join together, and make but one sin of it, false swearing, so Jarchi and Kimchi; but that swearing itself signifies, as the Targum interprets it; for it not only takes in all cursing and imprecations, profane oaths, and taking the name of God in vain, and swearing by the creatures, but may chiefly design perjury; which, though one kind of "lying", may be distinguished from it here; the latter intending "lying" in common, which the devil is the father of, mankind are incident unto, and which is abominable to God, whether in civil or in religious things: "and killing, and stealing and committing adultery"; murders, thefts, and adulteries, were very common with them; sins against the sixth, eighth, and seventh commandments: <p>they break out; through all the restraints of the laws of God and man, like an unruly horse that breaks his bridle and runs away; or like wild beasts, that break down the fences and enclosures about them, and break out, and get away; or like a torrent of water, that breaks down its dams and banks, and overflows the meadows and plains; such a flood and deluge of sin abounded in the nation. Some render it, "they thieve" (o); or act the part of thieves and robbers: and the Targum, <p>"they beget sons of their neighbours' wives;'' <p>and so Abarbinel interprets it of breaking through the hedge of another man's wife; but these sins are observed before: <p>and blood toucheth blood; which some understand of sins in general, so called, because filthy and abominable; and of the addition and multiplication of them, there being as it were heaps of them, or rather a chain of them linked together. So the Targum, <p>"and they add sins to sins.'' <p>Others interpret it of impure mixtures, of incestuous lusts, or marriages contrary to the ties of blood, and laws of consanguinity, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6</a>, or rather it is to be understood of the great effusion of blood, and frequency of murders; so that there was scarce any interval between them, but a continued series of them. Some think respect is had to the frequent slaughter of their kings; Zachariah the son of Jeroboam was slain by Shallum, when he had reigned but six months; and Shallum was slain by Menahem when he had reigned but one month; and this Menahem was a murderer of many, smote many places, and ripped up the women with child; Pekahiah his son was killed by Pekah the son of Remaliah, and he again by Hoshea, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8</a>. <p>(o) "latrocinantur, vel latrones agunt", Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hosea/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> blood toucheth blood.</span><p>(b) In every place appears a liberality to most wicked vices, so that one follows right after another.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">By swearing</span> …] Rather, <span class="bld">(There is nothing but)</span> <span class="bld">swearing and lying</span>, &c.

The absence of the virtues specified implies the presence of the opposite vices. In the most vivid and impressive manner the prophet, instead of enumerating prosaically the vices so prevalent at the time, expresses them more emphatically by a species of exclamation, using <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> infinitives absolute instead of finite verbs; thus: "Swearing, and lying, and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery." They may, however, be regarded as in the nominative as subjects to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. Instead of either supplying <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span>, to allot, or closely connecting" allot" with the verb "to lie," which immediately follows, it is better to understand the two verbs separately, as expressing two different species of sin; that is, swearing and cursing, and lying.  So the Septuagint renders them by the nouns <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "<span class="accented">cursing</span> and lying;" as also the Chaldee, "<span class="accented">they</span> swear falsely and lie." The commandments which the children of Israel thus violated were the third, the ninth, the sixth, the eighth, and the seventh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The construction, adopted in the LXX., Vulgate, and by Luther in his version, takes the infinitives (nounal expressions of habitual or continued actions) as nominatives to the verb <span class="accented">paratsu</span>; thus: "<span class="accented">Cursing</span>, and lying, and murder, and theft, and adultery abound (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) in the land;" "Maledictum, et mendacium, et homicidium, et furtum, et adulterium innndavernut;" and Luther translates, "Gotteslastern, Luger, Morder, Stehlen, and Ehebrechen hat uberhand genommen." The common mode <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of constructing the infinitives independently as above in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> or gerundively as in the Authorized Version, and in either ease understanding an indefinite subject to <span class="accented">paratsu</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> preferable on the whole; thus: "By swearing, etc., they break out." The allusion to the water overflowing its banks and spreading in all directions, implied in the Septuagint Version, is approved by Jerome in his Commentary: "He (the prophet) did not say <span class="accented">est</span>, but, to demonstrate the abundance of crimes, introduced <span class="accented">inundaverunt</span> (overflowed)." The common meaning of <span class="accented">parats</span> is to tear or break - break in upon, especially with violence, as robbers and murderers; <span class="accented">so paritsim</span> has the sense of murderers and robbers. It is better, therefore, to take the verb here as a present perfect connecting past and present, and to translate it" break through," or" in to," that is, as burglars into houses. So Kimchi, though figuratively: "They break through the wall which is the fence of the Law, and multiply transgressions." Similarly, De Wette has "Gewaltthat uber sie;" and Maurer likewise: "Jurare et mentiri et occidere et furari et adulterari! <span class="accented">Violenter agunt</span> et sanguines sanguines altingunt." The Massoretic accentuation favors (putting <span class="accented">athnach</span> at <span class="accented">naopt</span>) this construction; while the context, which speaks of bloodshed, is quite in keeping with acts of violence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a> there follows, in conclusion, the confirmation of the truth of what is said of the duration of this oppression for the people of God. Because the time of it was not seen by Daniel, but was revealed to him in words, &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is here used in reference to that which was, or of which it was, said. But we need not connect this relative sentence with the genitive &#1493;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (the evening and the morning), although this were admissible, but can make it depend on &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; (vision), since the world-revelation of the evenings and mornings forms an integral part of the "vision." &#1493;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; are to be taken collectively. The confirmation of the truth of this revelation does not betray the purpose to make the book falsely appear as if it were old (v. Leng., Hitzig); it much more is fitted to serve the purpose of strengthening the weakness of the faithful, and giving them consolation in the hour of trial. For in the statement of the duration of the afflictions lies not only the fact that they will come to an end, but at the same time also that this end is determined beforehand by God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>. In other places this confirmation serves only to meet doubts, arising from the weakness of the flesh, as to the realization of revelations of such weighty import; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-1.htm">Daniel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-6.htm">Revelation 22:6</a>.<p>But Daniel must close the prophecy, because it extends into a long time. &#1505;&#1514;&#1503; is not equivalent to &#1495;&#1514;&#1501;, to seal up, but it means to stop, to conclude, to hide (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a>), but not in the sense of keeping secret, or because it would be incomprehensible for the nearest times; for to seal or to shut up has nothing in common with incomprehensibility, but is used in the sense of keeping. "A document is sealed up in the original text, and laid up in archives (shut up), that it may remain preserved for remote times, but not that it may remain secret, while copies of it remain in public use" (Kliefoth). The meaning of the command, then, is simply this: "Preserve the revelation, not because it is not yet to be understood, also not for the purpose of keeping it secret, but that it may remain preserved for distant times" (Kliefoth). The reason assigned for the command only agrees with this interpretation. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (to many days) is not to be identified with &#1500;&#1506;&#1514;&#1470;&#1511;&#1509; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, but designates only a long time; and this indefinite expression is here used because it was not intended to give exactly again the termination according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, but only to say that the time of the end was not near.</body></html>
