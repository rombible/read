And the king said, Let him come in....">Esther 6:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">The king said, Let him come in — </span>The king thought him the fittest man he had to be made use of, both in directing and in dispensing his favour, knowing nothing of any quarrel he had with Mordecai. <span class="ital">So Haman came in </span>— Proud of the honour done him, in being admitted into the king’s bed-chamber, before he was up; for it is likely the king only wished to give orders for the honouring of Mordecai, and then he would be easy in his mind, and try to sleep. Haman, however, thinks of finding the king alone, and unengaged, and that this was the fairest opportunity he could wish for, to solicit for Mordecai’s execution. <span class="ital">And the king — </span>Whose heart was as full as his, and who, as was fit, spoke first; <span class="ital">said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? </span>— He names no one, because he would have the more impartial answer. It is a good property in kings and other superiors, to delight in bestowing rewards, and not to delight in punishing. <span class="ital">Now Haman thought in his heart</span> <span class="ital">— </span>As he had great reason to do, because of the favour which the king had showed to him above all others; <span class="ital">To whom would the king delight to do honour more than myself? — </span>No one deserves to be honoured so much as I, nor stands so fair for it. See how men’s pride deceives them! The deceitfulness of our own hearts appears in nothing so much as in the good opinion we are wont to have of ourselves, and of our own performances, against which we should therefore constantly watch and pray. Haman thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, but he was deceived.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:4-11 See how men's pride deceives them. The deceitfulness of our own hearts appears in nothing more than in the conceit we have of ourselves and our own performances: against which we should constantly watch and pray. Haman thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, but he was deceived. We should suspect that the esteem which others profess for us, is not so great as it seems to be, that we may not think too well of ourselves, nor trust too much in others. How Haman is struck, when the king bids him do honour to Mordecai the Jew, the very man whom he hated above all men, whose ruin he was now designing!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was a settled principle of the Persian government that "Royal Benefactors" were to receive an adequate reward. The names of such persons were placed on a special roll, and care was taken that they should be properly recompensed, though they sometimes waited for months or years before they were rewarded. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Now Haman was come into the outward court&#8212;This was early in the morning. It is the invariable custom for kings in Eastern countries to transact business before the sun is hot, often in the open air, and so Haman was in all probability come officially to attend on his master.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/esther/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king's servants said unto him, behold, Haman standeth in the court,.... In the outward court; for into the inward court none might enter without being called, for which he was waiting: <p>and the king said, let him come in; into his bedchamber; and it was of God, no doubt, that Haman should be on the spot at this very time, when the king was in the humour to do honour to Mordecai, and by him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/esther/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court.
