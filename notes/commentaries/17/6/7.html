To form a notion of that height of pride and arrogance at which Haman, who thought all the honours he specified were designed for himself, was arrived, we may observe, that for any one to put on the royal robe without the privity and consent of the king was among the Persians accounted a capital crime. <span class="ital">And the horse that the king rideth upon — </span>Namely, usually; which was well known, both by his excellence, and especially by his peculiar trappings and ornaments. <span class="ital">And the crown royal which is set upon his head — </span>Upon the king’s head.

The deceitfulness of our own hearts appears in nothing more than in the conceit we have of ourselves and our own performances: against which we should constantly watch and pray. Haman thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, but he was deceived. We should suspect that the esteem which others profess for us, is not so great as it seems to be, that we may not think too well of ourselves, nor trust too much in others. How Haman is struck, when the king bids him do honour to Mordecai the Jew, the very man whom he hated above all men, whose ruin he was now designing!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was a settled principle of the Persian government that "Royal Benefactors" were to receive an adequate reward.
