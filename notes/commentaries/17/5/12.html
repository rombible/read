Self-admirers and self-flatterers are really self-deceivers. Haman, the higher he is lifted up, the more impatient he is of contempt, and the more enraged at it. The affront from Mordecai spoiled all. A slight affront, which a humble man would scarcely notice, will torment a proud man, even to madness, and will mar all his comforts. Those disposed to be uneasy, will never want something to be uneasy at. Such are proud men; though they have much to their mind, if they have not all to their mind, it is as nothing to them. Many call the proud happy, who display pomp and make a show; but this is a mistaken thought. Many poor cottagers feel far less uneasiness than the rich, with all their fancied advantages around them. The man who knows not Christ, is poor though he be rich, because he is utterly destitute of that which alone is true riches.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The multitude of his children - Herodotus tells us that, next to prowess in arms, it was regarded as the greatest proof of manly excellence in Persia to be the father of many sons."

Haman being the only invited guest with the king and queen, it was natural that he should have been elated with the honor.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thus he makes that matter of glorying which was designed for and the occasion of his utter ruin. So ignorant are the wisest men, and subject to fatal mistakes; rejoicing when they have most cause of fear and grief, and sorrowing for those things which tend to joy and comfort. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/esther/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Haman said, moreover,.... To all which he added, and what seemed to delight him most of all, or however was a new additional honour done him: <p>yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; which he judged was doing him singular honour; and, by the joint affection of the king and queen to him, he thought himself established in his dignity and grandeur: <p>and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the king; had been invited, not by a messenger, but by the queen herself, which was a double honour. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/esther/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/esther/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At the repast, and indeed at "the banquet of wine," when the greatest cheerfulness would prevail, the king repeated his question as to the desire of the queen, making the same promise as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-3.htm">Esther 5:3</a>. &#1493;&#1514;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;, an abbreviated form of the imperfect &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, is optative or jussive: and it shall be done.</body></html>
