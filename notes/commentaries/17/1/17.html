Seasons of peculiar festivity often end in vexation. Superiors should be careful not to command what may reasonably be disobeyed. But when wine is in, men's reason departs from them. He that had rule over 127 provinces, had no rule over his own spirit. But whether the passion or the policy of the king was served by this decree, God's providence made way for Esther to the crown, and defeated Haman's wicked project, even before it had entered into his heart, and he arrived at his power. Let us rejoice that the Lord reigns, and will overrule the madness or folly of mankind to promote his own glory, and the safety and happiness of his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In Marsena we may perhaps recognize the famous Mardonius, and in Admatha, Xerxes' uncle, Artabanus.<p>The seven princes - There were seven families of the first rank in Persia, from which alone the king could take his wives.

Then the king said to the wise men&#8212;These were probably the magi, without whose advice as to the proper time of doing a thing the Persian kings never did take any step whatever; and the persons named in Es 1:14 were the "seven counsellors" (compare Ezr 7:14) who formed the state ministry. The combined wisdom of all, it seems, was enlisted to consult with the king what course should be taken after so unprecedented an occurrence as Vashti's disobedience of the royal summons. It is scarcely possible for us to imagine the astonishment produced by such a refusal in a country and a court where the will of the sovereign was absolute. The assembled grandees were petrified with horror at the daring affront. Alarm for the consequences that might ensue to each of them in his own household next seized on their minds; and the sounds of bacchanalian revelry were hushed into deep and anxious consultation what punishment to inflict on the refractory queen. But a purpose was to be served by the flattery of the king and the enslavement of all women. The counsellors were too intoxicated or obsequious to oppose the courtly advice of Memucan was unanimously resolved, with a wise regard to the public interests of the nation, that the punishment of Vashti could be nothing short of degradation from her royal dignity. The doom was accordingly pronounced and made known in all parts of the empire.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/esther/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women,....

The name Vashti may be compared with the Old-Persian vahista, i.e., optimus. In Persian s&#780;ty, means a beautiful woman. This statement serves as an introduction to the scene which follows. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-11.htm">Esther 1:11</a>. On the seventh, i.e., the last day of the banquet, when the king's heart was merry with wine, he commanded his seven chamberlains to bring Vashti the queen before him, with the royal crown, to show here beauty to the people and princes. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, when the heart of the king was merry through wine, i.e., when the wine had made him merry, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>. It was the office of the seven eunuchs who served before the king (&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>) to be the means of communication between him and the women, and to deliver to them messages on the part of the monarch. Their number, seven, was connected with that of the Amshaspands; see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>. The attempts made to explain their several names are without adequate foundation; nor would much be gained thereby, the names being of no significance with respect to the matter in question. In the lxx the names vary to some extent. The queen was to appear with the crown on her head (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; or &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, a high turban terminating in a point), and, as is self-evident, otherwise royally apparelled. The queen was accustomed on ordinary occasions to take her meals at the king's table; comp. Herod. ix. 110. There is, however, an absence of historical proof, that she was present at great banquets. The notice quoted from Lucian in Brissonius, de regio Pers. princ. i. c. 103, is not sufficient for the purpose. </body></html>
