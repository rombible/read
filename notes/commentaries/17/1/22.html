The English Version does distinct violence to the Hebrew, perhaps because the literal rendering yielded a somewhat peculiar sense. Taking the words exactly as they stand, they can only mean that in a house where two or more languages are used, from the presence of foreign wives, the husband is to take care that his own language is not supplanted by any of theirs. This is intelligible enough, but is perhaps rather irrelevant to what goes before.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/esther/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-22.htm" title="For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.">Esther 1:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">That it should be published according to the language of every people — </span>That all sorts of persons, not men only, but women also, might understand it, and therefore be inexcusable if they did not comply with it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:10-22 Ahasuerus's feast ended in heaviness, by his own folly.

He that had rule over 127 provinces, had no rule over his own spirit. But whether the passion or the policy of the king was served by this decree, God's providence made way for Esther to the crown, and defeated Haman's wicked project, even before it had entered into his heart, and he arrived at his power.

Then the king said to the wise men&#8212;These were probably the magi, without whose advice as to the proper time of doing a thing the Persian kings never did take any step whatever; and the persons named in Es 1:14 were the "seven counsellors" (compare Ezr 7:14) who formed the state ministry. The combined wisdom of all, it seems, was enlisted to consult with the king what course should be taken after so unprecedented an occurrence as Vashti's disobedience of the royal summons. It is scarcely possible for us to imagine the astonishment produced by such a refusal in a country and a court where the will of the sovereign was absolute. The assembled grandees were petrified with horror at the daring affront. Alarm for the consequences that might ensue to each of them in his own household next seized on their minds; and the sounds of bacchanalian revelry were hushed into deep and anxious consultation what punishment to inflict on the refractory queen. But a purpose was to be served by the flattery of the king and the enslavement of all women. The counsellors were too intoxicated or obsequious to oppose the courtly advice of Memucan was unanimously resolved, with a wise regard to the public interests of the nation, that the punishment of Vashti could be nothing short of degradation from her royal dignity. The doom was accordingly pronounced and made known in all parts of the empire.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That all sorts of persons, not men only, (who by study or travel many times understand divers languages,) but the women also, might understand it, and therefore be inexcusable if they did not comply with it; for which end it was not only written in each language, for that writing might come but to few hands, but moreover it was published in the several cities and towns by such persons as used to publish the king’s edicts. Others, <span class="ital">that he should speak in the language of his own people</span>, i.e. that men should not, in compliance with their wives, who were oft of other nations and languages, inure themselves to it, and bring their wives’ language into the family; but that men should use their own proper language, and cause their wives and children to use it; this being one sign of dominion, and therefore frequent after this time among the Greeks and Romans, who, together with their victorious arms, brought in their language into other countries, and in a great measure imposed it upon them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/esther/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he sent letters unto all the king's provinces,.... The one hundred and twenty seven provinces, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>, which, according to the Targum, were written and sealed with his own seal; which is very probable: <p>into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; that is, these letters were written in the language, and in the characters in which that language was written, used in each of the provinces to which these letters were sent, that they might be easily read and understood by all: the sum of which was: <p>that every man should bear rule in his own house; be prince, lord, and master there, and his commands obeyed, not only by his children and servants, but by his wife also: <p>and that it should be published according to the language of every people; but as this is expressed, or at least implied, in the first clause of this verse, it should rather be rendered, "and that he should speak according to the language of his people"; and so is the latter Targum; it seems as if a man, who had married a woman in another country, in complaisance to her had neglected his own native tongue, and used hers in the family, by which means he lost, or seemed to lose, his authority in it: now, to guard against this, this part of the law was made; and, according to Jarchi, the husband was to compel his wife to learn and speak his language, if she was a foreigner; to which agrees the first Targum, which paraphrases the whole thus,"that a man rule over his wife, and oblige her to speak according to the language of her husband, and the speech of his people;''and, in later times, Bahram Gaur forbid any other language, besides the Persian, to be used within his port, either in speaking or writing (b). <p>(b) Vid.

See further on <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-13.htm" title="And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.">Esther 3:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to every people after their language</span>] It would be interesting to know in detail the languages in which these letters may be supposed to have been written. We cannot, however, hope to attain completeness in our list, although there are a considerable number which we may confidently include, as spoken by the subjects of an Empire reaching ‘from India even unto Ethiopia’ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even to Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)">Esther 1:1</a> with note). They may be classed as follows:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) <span class="ital">Semitic</span>. In Babylonia Assyrian or the cognate Babylonian was the language of the government, while probably Aramaic, which is closely akin to these, was commonly spoken. This last, it would appear, was used throughout a large portion of the Persian Empire, and Aramaic inscriptions—one of them bearing date in the fourth year of Xerxes[61]—have been found in a country as distant from the centre of Persian rule as Egypt. The great Semitic family of languages, of which Aramaic is a member, prevailed in more or less varying forms (in addition to the above-named Assyrian and Babylonian) in a large part of the Persian king’s dominions, viz. Phoenician, Arabic, Hebrew, and Western or Biblical Aramaic.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[61] See the Palaeographical Society’s Oriental Series, plate lxiii.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) <span class="ital">Turanian</span>. In parts of Assyria and Babylonia there may also have been surviving dialects which belong to a wholly different group of languages, and formed the speech of the old Accadian and Sumerian population. These were branches of the <span class="ital">Turanian</span> or <span class="ital">Agglutinative</span> family of which Turkish is one of the representatives at the present day. To this class also belonged Georgian, the most important of the languages spoken on the southern side of the principal Caucasus range.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) <span class="ital">Aryan</span>. This great family, to which can be traced most of the languages of modern Europe, would include Sanscrit and Prakrit, the latter of which is the mother of a large number of the Indian dialects, Zend, the old language of Bactria, and, lastly, the language of Greece, which doubtless at the time of Xerxes was making its way steadily eastward from the country of its birth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and should publish it according to the language of his people</span>] The literal rendering of the Hebrew is <span class="ital">that every man should be ruling in his own house and speaking according to the language of his own people</span>. This has been explained to refer to cases where men had taken wives from other nations. The wife then must conform to her husband as regards the matter in question, and the language used in the family must be the mother tongue of the latter (so the Targum). The clause will thus be a particular application of the general ordinance that ‘every man should bear rule in his own house.’ Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm" title="In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:">Nehemiah 13:23</a> f.) points out as one of the evils of marriages between Jews and non-Jews confusion of language on the part of the children of such unions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is, however, doubtful if the text is sound, and a conjecture has been widely adopted, which involves the change of not more than one Heb. consonant.[62] The meaning then will be, <span class="ital">and shall speak whatsoever seems good to him</span>, i.e. shall give whatever orders he chooses. In favour of this emendation it is pointed out that the new verb introduced by it into the Heb. text is one which, though not very frequent elsewhere, occurs in three other passages in this Book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-8.htm" title="And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.">Esther 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-13.htm" title="Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.">Esther 5:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-4.htm" title="For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for slaves and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.">Esther 7:4</a>). On the other hand it is dubious whether the construction which it involves is permissible Hebrew. The LXX. omits the words, and translates the preceding clause, <span class="ital">so that they might have fear in their houses</span>, meaning apparently, <span class="ital">so that the husbands might be respected at home</span>.[63]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[62] <span class="greekheb">כָּל־שֹׁוֶה עִמּוֹ</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">כִּלְשׁוֹן עַמּוֹ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[63] <span class="greekheb">ὥστε εἶναι φόβον αὐτοῖς ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις αὐτῶν</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he sent</span>. Rather, "<span class="accented">and</span> he sent." Besides publishing the decree, Ahasuerus sent letters prescribing certain things, viz.: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That every man should bear rule in his own house; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That every man should speak his own language in his family, and not that of his wife, if it were different. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is the plain meaning of the existing text, which cannot bear either of the senses suggested in the Authorised Version. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/esther/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The counsel of the wise men. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16</a>. Memucan, who was the last mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>, comes forward as spokesman for the rest, and declares before the king and the princes, i.e., in a solemn assembly, and evidently as the result of a previous joint consultation: Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king alone, but also to all the princes and all the people, because the example of the queen will lead all the Median and Persian wives to despise their husbands. Therefore an irrevocable edict is to be published decreeing the divorce of Queen Vashti, and this law published throughout the whole realm, that all wives may show honour to their husbands. Vashti has not transgressed against the king alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16</a>), but against all the princes and people in all the provinces of King Ahashverosh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16</a>). In what respect, then, is the latter assertion true? We are told <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-17.htm">Esther 1:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-18.htm">Esther 1:18</a>. "For the deed of the queen will come abroad to (&#1506;&#1500; for &#1488;&#1500;) all women, to bring their husbands into contempt in their eyes (the infin. &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514; stating the result), while they will say," etc. (the suffix of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1501; relates to the women, who will appeal to the disobedience of the queen). <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-18.htm">Esther 1:18</a>. "And this day (i.e., already) the princesses of the Persians and Medians, who hear of the act of the queen (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, not the word, but the thing, i.e., her rejection of her husband's command), will tell it to all the princes of the king, and (there will be) enough contempt and provocation. &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; is an outburst of anger; here, therefore, a provocation to wrath. Bertheau makes the words &#1494;&#1511; &#1489;&#1494; &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;&#1497; the object of &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, which, after the long parenthesis, is united to the copula by w, and for, "to speak contempt and wrath," reads: to speak contemptuously in wrath. But this change cannot be substantiated. The expression, to speak wrath, is indeed unexampled, but that is no reason for making &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; stand for &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1510;&#1507;, the very adoption of such an ellipsis showing, that this explanation is inadmissible. The words must be taken alone, as an independent clause, which may be readily completed by &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;: and contempt and wrath will be according to abundance. &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; is a litotes for: more than enough. The object of &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; must be supplied from the context: it - that is, what the queen said to her husband. In the former verse Memucan was speaking of all women; here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-18.htm">Esther 1:18</a>) he speaks only of the princesses of the Persians and Medes, because these are staying in the neighbourhood of the court, and will immediately hear of the matter, and "after the manner of the court ladies and associates of a queen will quickly follow, and appeal to her example" (Berth.). </body></html>
