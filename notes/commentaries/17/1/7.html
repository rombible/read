This was vain glory. Better is a dinner of herbs with quietness, than this banquet of wine, with all the noise and tumult that must have attended it. But except grace prevails in the heart, self-exaltation and self-indulgence, in one form or another, will be the ruling principle. Yet none did compel; so that if any drank to excess, it was their own fault. This caution of a heathen prince, even when he would show his generosity, may shame many called Christians, who, under pretence of sending the health round, send sin round, and death with it.

Drinking-vessels of gold were found in considerable numbers in the Persian camp near Plataea (Herod., 9:80) when the Greeks took it. They had been the property of Persian nobles. The king would naturally possess in great abundance whatever luxury was affected by the upper class of his subjects. <span class="cmt_word">The vessels being diverse one from another</span>. This is a minute point, which must have come from an eye-witness, or from one who had received the account of the banquet from an eye-witness. It was perhaps unusual. At least, in the grand banquet represented by Sargon on the walls of his palace at Khorsabad, it is observable that all the guests hold in their hands goblets which are exactly alike (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 214). <span class="cmt_word">Royal</span> <span class="cmt_word">wine</span>. Literally, "wine of the kingdom" - wine, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the royal cellar, and therefore good wine, but not necessarily the "wine of Helbon, which was the only wine that the king himself drank (Athen., 'Deipnosoph,' 4. p. 145, A). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/esther/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The banquet. <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1-3</a> mark a period. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, which belongs to &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, does not follow till <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>, and even then the statement concerning the feast is again interrupted by a long parenthesis, and not taken up again and completed till <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>. On the use of &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; in historical narratives at the beginning of relations having, as in the present instance and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>, no reference to a preceding narrative, see the remark on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>. Even when no express reference to any preceding occurrence takes place, the historian still puts what he has to relate in connection with other historical occurrences by an "and it came to pass." Ahashverosh is, as has already been remarked on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4.htm">Ezra 4</a>, Xerxes, the son of Darius Hystaspis. Not only does the name &#1488;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; point to the Old-Persian name Ks'ayars'a (with &#1488; prosthetic), but the statements also concerning the extent of the kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/10-1.htm">Esther 10:1</a>), the manners and customs of the country and court, the capricious and tyrannical character of Ahashverosh, and the historical allusions are suitable only and completely to Xerxes, so that, after the discussions of Justi in Eichhorn's Repert. xv. pp. 3-38, and Baumgarten, de fide, etc., pp. 122-151, no further doubt on the subject can exist. As an historical background to the occurrences to be delineated, the wide extent of the kingdom ruled by the monarch just named is next described: "He is that Ahashverosh who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces." &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; ... &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; is not an accusative dependent on &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, he ruled 127 provinces, for &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, to reign, is construed with &#1506;&#1500; or &#1489;&#1468;, but is annexed in the form of a free apposition to the statement: "from India to Cush;" as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>. &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is in the Old-Persian cuneiform inscriptions, Hidhu; in Zend, Hendu; in Sanscrit, Sindhu, i.e., dwellers on the Indus, for Sindhu means in Sanscrit the river Indus; comp. Roediger in Gesenius, Thes. Append. p. 83, and Lassen, Indische Alterthumsk. i. p. 2. &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; is Ethiopia. This was the extent of the Persian empire under Xerxes. Mardonius in Herod. 7:9 names not only the Sakers and Assyrians, but also the Indians and Ethiopians as nations subject to Xerxes. Comp. also Herod. 7:97, 98, and 8:65, 69, where the Ethiopians and Indians are reckoned among the races who paid tribute to the Persian king and fought in the army of Xerxes. The 127 &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, provinces, are governmental districts, presided over, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>, by satraps, pechahs, and rulers. This statement recalls that made in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-2.htm">Daniel 6:2</a>, that Darius the Mede set over his kingdom 120 satraps. We have already shown in our remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-2.htm">Daniel 6:2</a> that this form of administration is not in opposition to the statement of Herod. iii. 89f., that Darius Hystaspis divided the kingdom for the purpose of taxation into twenty &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; which were called &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. The satrapies into which Darius divided the kingdom generally comprised several provinces. The first satrapy, e.g., included Mysia and Lydia, together with the southern part of Phrygia; the fourth, Syria and Phoenicia, with the island of Cyprus. The Jewish historians, on the other hand, designate a small portion of this fourth satrapy, viz., the region occupied by the Jewish community (Judah and Benjamin, with their chief city Jerusalem), as &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3</a>. Consequently the satrapies of Darius mentioned in Herodotus differ from the medinoth of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-2.htm">Daniel 6:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>. The 127 medinoth are a division of the kingdom into geographical regions, according to the races inhabiting the different provinces; the list of satrapies in Herodotus, on the contrary, is a classification of the nations and provinces subject to the empire, determined by the tribute imposed on them.</body></html>
