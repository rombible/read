Such a one was Atossa, the mother of Xerxes. Vashti, too, before her deposition, was evidently <span class= "ital">the</span> queen <span class= "ital">par excel. lence.</span> We find, however, that the name given by the Greek writers to the queen of Xerxes was Amestris, of whose cruelty and dissolute life numerous details are given us by Herodotus and others. There seem good grounds for believing that she was the wife of Xerxes before he became king, which if established would of itself be sufficient to disprove the theory of some who would identify Esther and Amestris. Moreover, Herodotus tells us (7:61. <span class= "ital">82</span>) that Amestris was the cousin of Xerxes, the daughter of his father’s brother; and although we cannot view Esther as of a specially high type of womanhood, still it would be most unjust to identify her with one whose character is presented to us in most unlovely guise. Bishop Wordsworth suggests that Amestris was a wife who had great influence with Xerxes between the fall of Vashti and the rise of Esther. If, however, Amestris was really the chief wife before Xerxes came to the throne, this could hardly be, and the time allowed seems much too scanty, seeing that in it falls the invasion of Greece. Or, lastly, we may with Canon Rawlinson say that Vashti is Amestris (the two names being different reproductions of the Persian, or Vashti being a sort of title) and that the deposition was a temporary one.<p><span class= "bld">The women.</span>—There should be no article.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/esther/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-9.htm" title="Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.">Esther 1:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women — </span>While the king entertained the men.

This was vain glory. Better is a dinner of herbs with quietness, than this banquet of wine, with all the noise and tumult that must have attended it. But except grace prevails in the heart, self-exaltation and self-indulgence, in one form or another, will be the ruling principle. Yet none did compel; so that if any drank to excess, it was their own fault. This caution of a heathen prince, even when he would show his generosity, may shame many called Christians, who, under pretence of sending the health round, send sin round, and death with it.

The name may be explained either as a corruption of Amestris, or as a title, vahishta, (Sanskrit: vasishtha, the superlative of vasu, "sweet"); and it may be supposed that the disgrace recorded (<a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-19.htm">Esther 1:19-21</a>, see the note) was only temporary; Amestris in the later part of Xerxes' reign recovering her former dignity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

For it was not customary with the Persians, nor other eastern nations, to admit of women to their festivals (m), but they feasted by themselves. Who Vashti was is not known with any certainty. Bishop Usher, who takes Ahasuerus to be Darius Hystaspis, thinks Vashti was Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, whom he married. The Targumist says, she was the daughter of Evilmerodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar. Her name seems to be the same with Vesta, a deity worshipped by the Persians, as Xenophon (n), and signifies vehement fire, which was in great veneration with them; and therefore this queen is most likely to be of Persian original: she kept her feast <p>in the royal house which belonged to Ahasuerus; her guests not being so many, there was room enough in the king's palace for them, and where it was more decent for them to be than in the open air in the garden, and exposed to the sight of men. <p>(m) Justin c Trogo, l. 41. c. 3.((n) Cyropaedia, l. 1. c. 23. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/esther/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/esther/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Vashti the queen</span>] If we identify Ahasuerus with Xerxes, the queen here mentioned must have been Amestris, his only wife known to secular history. She was daughter of Otanes (Herod. vii. 61), one of the seven who conspired against Pseudo-Smerdis (b.c. 522). The name Vashti has been explained as another form of Amestris, the letters <span class="ital">m</span> and <span class="ital">v</span> readily interchanging as labials.

The only wife of Xerxes known to the Greeks was Amestris, the daughter of Otanes, one of the seven conspirators (Herod., 7:61). Xerxes probably took her to wife as soon as he was of marriageable age, and before he ascended the throne had a son by her, who in his seventh year was grown up (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 9:108). It would seem to be certain that if Ahasuerus is Xerxes, Vashti must be Amestris. The names themselves are not very remote, since will readily interchange with <span class="accented">v</span>; but Vashti might possibly represent not the real name of the queen, but a favourite epithet, such as <span class="accented">vahista</span>, "<span class="accented">sweetest."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Made a feast for the women</span>. Men and women did not take their meals together in Persia unless in the privacy of domestic life (Brisson, 'De Regn. Pers.,' 2. pp. 273-276). If the women, therefore, were to partake in a festivity, it was necessary that they should be entertained separately. In the royal house. In the gynaeceum or harem, which was probably on the southern side of the great pillared hall at Susa (Fergusson). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:10-22 THE DISGRACE OF VASHTI (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10-22</a>). On the seventh day of the feast "to all in Shushan" (ver. 5), the king having excited himself with drink, took it into his head to send a message to Vashti, requiring her to make her appearance in the banquet of the men, since he desired to exhibit her beauty to the assembled guests, as "she was fair to look on" (ver. 11). His design must have been to present her unveiled to the coarse admiration of a multitude of semi-drunken revellers, in order that they might envy him the possession of so lovely a wife. Such a proceeding was a gross breach of Persian etiquette, and a cruel outrage upon one whom he above all men was bound to protect. Vashti, therefore, declined to obey (ver. 12). Preferring the risk of death to dishonour, she braved the anger of her despotic lord, and sent him back a message by his chamberlains that she would not come. We can well understand that to an absolute monarch such a rebuff, in the face of his whole court and of some hundreds or thousands of assembled guests, must have been exasperating in the extreme. At the moment when he had thought to glorify himself by a notable display of his omnipotence, he was foiled, defeated, made a laughing-stock to all Susa. "Therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him." It is to his credit that, being thus fiercely enraged, he did not proceed to violence, but so far restrained himself as to refer the matter to the judgment of others, and ask the "<span class="accented">seven</span> princes" the question, "What is to be done according to law unto queen Vashti, for not performing the commandment of the king?" (ver. 15). The advice of the princes, uttered by one of their body (vers. 16-20), and assented to by the remainder (ver. 21), was, that Yashti should be degraded from the position of queen, and her place given to another. This sentence was supported by specious arguments based upon expediency, and ignoring entirely the outrageous character of the king's command, which was of course the real, and sole, justification of Vashti's disobedience. It was treated as a simple question of the wife's duty to obey her husband, and the husband's right to enforce submission. Ahasuerus, as might be expected, received the decision of his obsequious counsellors with great satisfaction, and forthwith sent letters into all the provinces of his vast empire, announcing what had been done, and requiring wives everywhere to submit themselves unreservedly to the absolute rule of their lord (ver. 22). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/esther/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"In the third year of his reign he made a feast to all his princes and his servants, when the forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, were before him." &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to make, to prepare, i.e., to give, a feast; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-8.htm">Genesis 21:8</a>. The princes and the servants are, all who were assembled about him in Susa. These are specified in the words which follow as &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1508;. We might supply &#1500; before &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; from the preceding words, (viz.) the forces, etc.; but this would not suit the &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; at the end of the verse. For this word shows that an independent circumstantial clause begins with &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, which is added to call attention to the great number of princes and servants assembled at Susa (Bertheau): the forces of Persia ... were before him: when they were before him. By &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, the host, the forces, Bertheau thinks the body-guard of the king, which, according to Herod. vii. 40, consisted of 2000 selected horsemen, 2000 lancers, and 10,000 infantry, is intended. There is, however, no adequate reason for limiting &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; to the body-guard. It cannot, indeed, be supposed that the whole military power of Persia and Media was with the king at Susa; but &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; without &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; can only signify an lite of the army, perhaps the captains and leaders as representing it, just as "the people" is frequently used for "the representatives of the people." The Persians and Medes are always named together as the two kindred races of the ruling nation. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-9.htm">Daniel 6:9</a>, who, however, as writing in the reign of Darius the Mede, places the Medes first and the Persians second, while the contrary order is observed here when the supremacy had been transferred to the Persians by Cyrus. On the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>. After the mention of the forces, the Partemim, i.e., nobles, magnates (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3</a>), and the princes of the provinces are named as the chief personages of the civil government.</body></html>
