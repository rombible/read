Hence the Jews have a rule, that they should make a collection of money, at this time of the year, to send to the poor, to enable them to provide for themselves things necessary to make a feast; which money they judge it unlawful to apply to any other use.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-19 The enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them by the former edict. If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, they would not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together, strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, and with one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, who endeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than our lives. The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt of wordly wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothing except their own preservation. In every case the people of God should manifest humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantages which might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festival the day after they had finished their work.

Jarchi observes that those in the villages, who are they that do not dwell in walled towns, observed the fourteenth, and they in towns surrounded with walls the fifteenth, as Shushan; and this circumvallation, he says, must be what was from the days of Joshua; according to the Jewish canons, every place that was walled from the days of Joshua the son of Nun, whether in the land of Israel or out of it, though not now walled they read (i.e. the book of Esther) on the fifteenth of Adar, and this is called a walled town; but a place which was not walled in the days of Joshua, though now walled, they read in the fourteenth, and this is called a city; but the city Shushan, though it was not walled in the days of Joshua, they read on the fifteenth, because in it was done a miracle (m) and each of these was kept as a day of public rejoicing for their great deliverance and freedom from their enemies: <p>and a good day: as the Jews usually call the several days of the passover, pentecost, and tabernacles: <p>and of sending portions one to another: expressive of mutual joy, and congratulating one another upon the happiness they shared in; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-10.htm">Revelation 11:10</a>, and particularly this may respect sending gifts to the poor, who had not that to rejoice and make merry with others had; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>, though these seem to be distinct from them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-22.htm">Esther 9:22</a>. <p>(m) Maimon.

The writer is describing the custom of his own day as arising out of the circumstances here recounted. He implies that in his time the Jews who did not come under the above description followed the date at which those in Shushan celebrated their deliverance. The LXX., however, inserts a clause to this effect, viz. ‘But those who dwell in the chief cities keep the fifteenth day of Adar as a day of glad feasting, and of sending portions likewise to their neighbours.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and of sending portions one to another</span>] i.e. that the poor might share in the happiness of the occasion. The same procedure was enjoined by Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm" title="Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy to our LORD: neither be you sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.">Nehemiah 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-12.htm" title="And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.">Nehemiah 8:12</a>) at the proclamation of the Law in his time. It was in accordance with the ordinance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-14.htm" title="And you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within your gates.">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>) that the enjoyment of the Feast of Weeks should be extended to ‘the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.’ The custom of sending gifts (usually sweetmeats) is still preserved at Purim.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns</span>. Rather, "the Jews of the <span class="accented">country</span>, who dwelt in the <span class="accented">country</span> towns." There are places where the word translated "<span class="accented">unwalled"</span> connotes that idea - e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>; but the main notion which it expresses is always that of a "country region." Here walls are not at all in the thought of the writer, who intends a contrast between the Jews of the metropolis and those of the provinces. Ecbatana and Babylon are "<span class="accented">country</span> towns" to a Jew of Susa, such as the writer. <span class="cmt_word">A good day</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>, with the comment. <span class="cmt_word">Sending portions one to another</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>; and for the precept on which the practice was founded see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>. In modern times the Jews keep up the practice, and on the 15th of Adar both interchange gifts, chiefly sweetmeats, and make liberal offerings for the poor (comp. ver. 22, <span class="accented">ad fin</span>.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/esther/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Esther requested: "let it be granted to the Jews which are in Susa to do to-morrow also according to the decree of to-day (i.e., exactly as to-day), and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged upon the tree," i.e., their dead bodies nailed on crosses - majoris infamiae causa, according to Hebrew and Persian custom; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22</a> and the explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-11.htm">Ezra 6:11</a>.
