Great expectation there was, no doubt, of this day, and the issue of it. The Jews’ cause was to be tried by battle, and the day fixed for the combat by authority. Their enemies resolved not to lose the advantages given them by the first edict, in hope to overpower them by numbers. The Jews relied on the goodness of their God, and justice of their cause, and resolved to make their utmost efforts against their enemies. The day comes, at length, and here we learn that it was a day of victory and triumph to the Jews, both in the city of Shushan, and in all the rest of the king’s provinces. <span class="ital">In the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them </span>— That day which was selected by Haman, with great industry and art, as the most lucky day, and which their enemies had undoubtedly often thought of, and threatened them with; when, notwithstanding the later edict, they expected to have power over them by virtue of the former, they made assaults upon them accordingly, forming themselves into bodies, and joining in confederacy against them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-19 The enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them by the former edict. If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, they would not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together, strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, and with one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, who endeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than our lives. The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt of wordly wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothing except their own preservation. In every case the people of God should manifest humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantages which might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festival the day after they had finished their work. When we have received great mercies from God, we ought to be speedy in making thankful returns to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Drew near - Or, "arrived," or "reached the time" specified <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-12.htm">Esther 8:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Es 9:1-19.

"And it was written according to all that Mordochai commanded." They were sent to the Jews and to the satraps, etc., of the whole wide realm from India to Ethiopia (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>), while those of Haman had been issued only to the satraps, etc. The rest coincides with <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;, and he (Mordochai) wrote.

So Haug in Ewald's bibl. Jahrb. v. p. 154. The older explanation, mules, on the other hand, is founded on the modern Persian estar, which, to judge from the Sanscrit avatara, must in ancient Persian have been apatara. &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. from &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498;, answering to the Syriac remakaa', herd, especially a herd of horses, and to the Arabic ramaka, stud, is explained by Bertheau as a superlative form for the animal who excels the rest of the herd of stud in activity, perhaps the breeding stallion, while others understand it of the stud in general.
