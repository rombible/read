They had on their side all the executive of the empire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-3.htm" title="And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell on them.">Esther 9:3</a>), and evidently to all intents and purposes the second edict was considered virtually to repeal the first. The Jews, therefore, being in favour at Court, and, as was not unnatural after their alarm, being now full of indignation and vengeance, were probably resolved to use their opportunities while they had the chance. If so, who could object so long as they did nothing against the authorities? and they, we have seen, were on their side. That they did make a bloody use of their opportunity is shown clearly by <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-16.htm" title="But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,">Esther 9:16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/esther/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-2.htm" title="The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell on all people.">Esther 9:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities — </span>Imbodied and stood upon their defence, offering violence to none, but bidding defiance to all.

If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, they would not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together, strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, and with one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, who endeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than our lives. The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt of wordly wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothing except their own preservation. In every case the people of God should manifest humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantages which might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festival the day after they had finished their work. When we have received great mercies from God, we ought to be speedy in making thankful returns to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Drew near - Or, "arrived," or "reached the time" specified <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-12.htm">Esther 8:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

By "<span class="accented">their</span> cities" the writer means not cities exclusively Jewish, but cities where Jews formed an element in the population, as Susa, Babylon, Damascus - perhaps Rhages and Ecbatana - and no doubt many others. Cities exclusively Jewish, like Nearda, in later times (Joseph., 'Ant. Jud.,' 18:9, &sect; 1), scarcely existed as yet out of Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">To lay hand on such as sought their hurt</span>. The defensive character of the Jews' action is again noted. Only if their hurt was sought (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-13.htm">Psalm 71:13, 24</a>) did they lay hand on any; only against those who <span class="accented">sought their hurt</span> did they lift a finger. <span class="cmt_word">The fear of them</span>.

"And it was written according to all that Mordochai commanded." They were sent to the Jews and to the satraps, etc., of the whole wide realm from India to Ethiopia (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>), while those of Haman had been issued only to the satraps, etc. The rest coincides with <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;, and he (Mordochai) wrote.

So Haug in Ewald's bibl. Jahrb. v. p. 154. The older explanation, mules, on the other hand, is founded on the modern Persian estar, which, to judge from the Sanscrit avatara, must in ancient Persian have been apatara. &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. from &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498;, answering to the Syriac remakaa', herd, especially a herd of horses, and to the Arabic ramaka, stud, is explained by Bertheau as a superlative form for the animal who excels the rest of the herd of stud in activity, perhaps the breeding stallion, while others understand it of the stud in general. The contents of the edict follow in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-11.htm">Esther 8:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-12.htm">Esther 8:12</a> : "that the king allows the Jews in every city to assemble and to stand for their life (i.e., to fight for their lives, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>), to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish all the power (&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, military power) of the people and province that should assault them, children and women, and to plunder their property, upon a certain day," etc. The appointed time is thus stated as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>. The Jews were thus authorized to attack and destroy all enemies who should assault them on the day appointed for their extermination. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-13.htm">Esther 8:13</a> coincides with <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-14.htm">Esther 3:14</a>, with this difference, that the Jews are to be ready on this day to avenge themselves on their enemies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a> also is similar to <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>, except that the expression is strengthened by an addition to &#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-10.htm">Esther 8:10</a>, and by that of &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, urged on, to &#1502;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, hastened, to point out the utmost despatch possible. </body></html>
