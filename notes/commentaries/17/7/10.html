Then was the king's wrath pacified.">Esther 7:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai — </span>As the sentence was short, so the execution was speedy, and he that expected every one to do him reverence is now made an ignominious spectacle to the world on a gallows fifty cubits high: and himself is sacrificed to justice, who disdained that less than a whole nation should be sacrificed to his revenge. Thus does God resist the proud, and those whom he resists will find him irresistible! Thus did mischief return on the person that contrived it, and <span class="ital">the wicked was snared in the work of his own hands. </span>If he had not set up that gallows, the king probably would not have thought of ordering him to be hanged; but as he had unjustly prepared it for a good man, he was justly condemned to suffer on it himself. The enemies of God’s church have often been thus <span class="ital">taken in their own craftiness. </span>In the morning, Haman designed himself for the robes, and Mordecai for the gallows: but the tables are now turned, and Mordecai has the crown and Haman the cross. <span class="ital">The Lord is known by the judgments which he executeth. </span>“I cannot pass over this wonderful harmony of providence,” says Josephus, (<span class="ital">Antiq., </span>50:2, c. 6,) “without a remark upon the almighty power, and admirable justice of the wisdom of God; not only in bringing Haman to his deserved punishment, but in trapping him in the very snare which he had laid for another, and turning a malicious invention upon the head of the inventor.” Bishop Patrick observes, on this wonderful deliverance of the Jewish nation, that “though, in the whole, there was no extraordinary manifestation of God’s power; no particular cause, or agent, which was in its working advanced above the ordinary pitch of nature; yet the contrivance, and suiting these ordinary agents appointed by God, is in itself more admirable than if the same end had been effected by means which were truly miraculous. That a king should not sleep, is no unusual thing, nor that he should solace his waking thoughts by hearing the annals of his own kingdom, or the journals of his own reign, read to him: but that he should be awake at that time, especially when Haman was watching to destroy the Jews, and that, in the chronicles of the kingdom, they should light on that place where Mordecai’s unrewarded services were recorded; that the king should resolve, thereupon, forthwith to do him honour; that Haman should come in at the very moment when he was so disposed; should ignorantly determine what honour should be done him, and be himself appointed to that ungrateful office: all this, no doubt, was from the Keeper of Israel, who neither slumbereth nor sleepeth, and was truly marvellous in his people’s eyes.” — See Dodd. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:7-10 The king was angry: those that do things with self-will, reflect upon them afterward with self-reproach. When angry, we should pause before we come to any resolution, and thus rule our own spirits, and show that we are governed by reason. Those that are most haughty and insolent when in power and prosperity, commonly, like Haman, are the most abject and poor-spirited when brought down. The day is coming when those that hate and persecute God's chosen ones, would gladly be beholden to them. The king returns yet more angry against Haman. Those about him were ready to put his wrath into execution. How little can proud men be sure of the interest they think they have! The enemies of God's church have often been thus taken in their own craftiness. The Lord is known by such judgments. Then was the king's wrath pacified, and not till then. And who pities Haman hanged on his own gallows? who does not rather rejoice in the Divine righteousness displayed in the destruction his own art brought upon him? Let the workers of iniquity tremble, turn to the Lord, and seek pardon through the blood of Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like the Greeks and Romans, the Persians reclined at their meals on sofas or couches.

Esther then took courage to express her petition. After the usual introductory phrases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-3.htm">Esther 7:3</a> like <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-8.htm">Esther 5:8</a>), she replied: "Let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request." For, she adds as a justification and reason for such a petition, "we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had been silent, for the enemy is not worth the king's damage." In this request &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; is a short expression for: the life of my people, and the preposition &#1489;, the so-called &#1489;&#1468; pretii. The request is conceived of as the price which she offers or presents for her life and that of her people. The expression &#1504;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, we are sold, is used by Esther with reference to the offer of Haman to pay a large sum into the royal treasury for the extermination of the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-7.htm">Esther 4:7</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, contracted after Aramaean usage from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1501;, and occurring also <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:6</a>, supposes a case, the realization of which is desired, but not to be expected, the matter being represented as already decided by the use of the perfect. The last clause, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, is by most expositors understood as a reference, on the part of Esther, to the financial loss which the king would incur by the extermination of the Jews. Thus Rambach, e.g., following R. Sal. ben Melech, understands the meaning expressed to be: hostis nullo modo aequare, compensare, resarcire potest pecunia sua damnum, quod rex ex nostro excidio patitur. So also Cler. and others. The confirmatory clause would in this case refer not to &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, but to a negative notion needing completion: but I dare not be silent; and such completion is itself open to objection. To this must be added, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; in Kal constructed with &#1489;&#1468; does not signify compensare, to equalize, to make equal, but to be equal; consequently the Piel should be found here to justify the explanation proposed. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; in Kal constructed with &#1489;&#1468; signifies to be of equal worth with something, to equal another thing in value. Hence Gesenius translates: the enemy does not equal the damage of the king, i.e., is not in a condition to compensate the damage. But neither when thus viewed does the sentence give any reason for Esther's statement, that she would have been silent, if the Jews had been sold for salves. Hence we are constrained, with Bertheau, to take a different view of the words, and to give up the reference to financial loss. &#1504;&#1494;&#1511;, in the Targums, means not merely financial, but also bodily, personal damage; e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-11.htm">Genesis 26:11</a>, to do harm, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-22.htm">1 Chronicles 16:22</a>. Hence the phrase may be understood thus: For the enemy is not equal to, is not worth, the damage of the king, i.e., not worthy that I should annoy the king with my petition. Thus Esther says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-4.htm">Esther 7:4</a> : The enemy has determined upon the total destruction of my people. If he only intended to bring upon them grievous oppression, even that most grievous oppression of slavery, I would have been silent, for the enemy is not worthy that I should vex or annoy the king by my accusation.</body></html>
