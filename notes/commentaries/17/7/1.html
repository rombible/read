How should we pray for the salvation of our relatives, friends, and all around us! When we petition great men, we must be cautious not to give them offence; even just complaints must often be kept back. But when we approach the King of kings with reverence, we cannot ask or expect too much. Though nothing but wrath be our due, God is able and willing to do exceeding abundantly, even beyond all we can ask or think.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is quite consonant with Oriental notions that Mordecai, after receiving the extraordinary honors assigned him, should return to the palace and resume his former humble employment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 7<p>Es 7:1-6.

And Haman, thinking (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, to say in one's heart, i.e., to think) to whom will the king delight to show honour more than to me (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;, projecting before me, surpassing me, hence adverbially, beyond me, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:12</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:16</a>)? votes immediately for the greatest possible mark of honour, and says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-7.htm">Esther 6:7</a>.: "As for the man in whose honour the king delighteth, let them bring the royal apparel with which the king has been clothed, and a horse on which the king has ridden, and the king's crown upon his head, and let them deliver this apparel and horse to one of the chief princes of the king, and let them array (i.e., with the royal apparel) the man in whose honour the king delighteth, and cause him to ride upon the horse through the streets of the city, and proclaim before him: Thus shall it be done to the man in whose honour the king delighteth." &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-7.htm">Esther 6:7</a>, precedes absolutely, and the predicate does not follow till &#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-9.htm">Esther 6:9</a>, where the preceding subject is now by an anacoluthon taken up in the accusative (&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;). Several clauses are inserted between, for the purpose of enumerating beforehand all that appertains to such a token of honour: a royal garment, a royal steed, a crown on the head, and one of the chief princes for the carrying out of the honour awarded. The royal garment is not only, as Bertheau justly remarks, such a one as the king is accustomed to wear, but, as is shown by the perf. &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, one which the king has himself already put on or worn. Hence it is not an ordinary state-robe, the so-called Median apparel which the king himself, the chief princes among the Persians, and those on whom the king bestowed such raiment were wont to appear in (Herod. 3.84, 7.116; Xenoph. Cyrop. 8.3.1, comp. with the note of Baehr on Her. 3.84), but a costly garment, the property of the sovereign himself. This was the highest mark of honour that could be shown to a subject. So too was the riding upon a horse on which the king had ridden, and whose head was adorned with a royal crown. &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is perf. Niph., not 1st pers. pl. imperf. Kal, as Maurer insists; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; refers to the head of the horse, not to the head of the man to be honoured, as Clericus, Rambach, and most ancient expositors explain the words, in opposition to the natural sense of - &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. We do not indeed find among classical writers any testimony to such an adornment of the royal steed; but the circumstance is not at all improbable, and seems to be corroborated by ancient remains, certain Assyrian and ancient Persian sculptures, representing the horses of the king, and apparently those of princes, with ornaments on their heads terminating in three points, which may be regarded as a kind of crown. The infin. absol. &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503; is a continuation of the preceding jussive &#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;: and they shall give, let them give the garment - to the hand of a man, i.e., hand or deliver to him. The garment and horse are to be delivered to one of the noblest princes, that he may bring them to the individual to be honoured, may array him in the garment, set him on the horse, and proclaim before him as he rides through the city, etc. On &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-4.htm">Esther 1:4</a>, and on the matter itself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>. &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1489; is either an open square, the place of public assemblage, the forum, or a collective signifying the wide streets of the city. &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a> and elsewhere.</body></html>
