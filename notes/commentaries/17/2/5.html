It may be assumed that Mordecai was a eunuch, by the way in which he was allowed access to the royal harem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-11.htm" title="And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.">Esther 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-22.htm" title="And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it to Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.">Esther 2:22</a>). The name Mordecai occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm" title="Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.

The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;">Nehemiah 7:7</a>, as one of those who returned to Judæa with Zerubbabel.<p><span class= "bld">The son of Jair.</span>—It is probable that the names here given are those of the actual father, grandfather, and great-grandfather of Mordecai; though some have thought that they are merely some of the more famous ancestors, Shimei being assumed to be the assailant of David, and Kish the father of Saul. The character of Mordecai strikes us at the outset as that of an ambitious, worldly man; who, though numbers of his tribe had returned to the land of their fathers, preferred to remain behind on the alien soil. The heroic lament of the exiles by Babel’s streams, who would not sing the Lord’s song in a strange land, who looked with horror at the thought that Jerusalem should be forgotten—such were not Mordecai’s thoughts, far from it: why endure hardships, when there is a chance of his adopted daughter’s beauty catching the eye of the sensual king, when through her he may vanquish his rival, and become that king’s chief minister?<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-20 We see to what absurd practices those came, who were destitute of Divine revelation, and what need there was of the gospel of Christ, to purify men from the lusts of the flesh, and to bring them back to the original institution of marriage. Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mordecai, the eunuch <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-11.htm">Esther 2:11</a>, has been conjectured to be the same as Matacas, who, according to Ctesias, was the most powerful of the eunuchs during the latter portion of the reign of Xerxes. Mordecai's line of descent is traced from a certain Kish, carried off by Nebuchadnezzar in 598 B.C. - the year of Jeconiah's captivity - who was his great-grandfather. The four generations, Kish, Shimei, Jair, Mordecai, correspond to the known generations in other cases, for example:<p>High priests kings of Persia Royal stock of Judah  Seraiah Cambyses Jeconiah  Jozadak Cyrus Salathiel  Jeshua Darius Zerubbabel  Joiakim Xerxes Hananiah  <p>The age of Mordecai at the accession of Xerxes may probably have been about 30 or 40; that of Esther, his first cousin, about 20. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew&#8212;Mordecai held some office about the court. But his "sitting at the king's gate" (Es 2:21) does not necessarily imply that he was in the humble condition of a porter; for, according to an institute of Cyrus, all state officers were required to wait in the outer courts till they were summoned into the presence chamber. He might, therefore, have been a person of some official dignity. This man had an orphan cousin, born during the exile, under his care, who being distinguished by great personal beauty, was one of the young damsels taken into the royal harem on this occasion. She had the good fortune at once to gain the good will of the chief eunuch [Es 2:9]. Her sweet and amiable appearance made her a favorite with all who looked upon her (Es 2:15, last clause). Her Hebrew name (Es 2:7) was Hadassah, that is, "myrtle," which, on her introduction into the royal harem, was changed to Esther, that is, the star Venus, indicating beauty and good fortune [Gesenius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/esther/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now in Shushan the palace was a certain Jew,.... Not one of the tribe of Judah, for he was afterwards called a Benjaminite; but was so called, because he was of the kingdom of Judah, which consisted of both tribes. Jarchi says, all that were carried captive with the kings of Judah were called Jews among the nations, though of another tribe: <p>whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; who was among those that came with Zerubbabel from Babylon to Jerusalem, and returned to Persia again, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>, though some think this was another Mordecai; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>, who descended not from Kish, the father of Saul, but a later and more obscure person. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/esther/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/esther/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">There was a certain Jew</span>] The grammatical form in the original may be intended to emphasize the abruptness with which Mordecai is brought upon the scene. The influence which he, a Jew, is to have upon the history is thus placed in significant contrast with the brilliancy of the court of Susa.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Mordecai</span>] It may surprise us that a name which properly means a votary of the Babylonian god Marduk, another form of Merodach (Jupiter), should be borne by a Jew.[64] It has been suggested that it may have been given to the son in compliment to a Babylonian friend or master, and without any reference to its derivation, just as, in later days, the name Martin, e.g. St Martin of Tours, is completely devoid of associations with its etymological source, Mars. Mordecai, the cousin and adoptive father of Esther, is to be distinguished from the Mordecai who was a companion of Zerubbabel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm" title="Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.

The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;">Nehemiah 7:7</a>). He has, without justification, been identified with Matacas, described by Ctesias[65] as a powerful favourite of Xerxes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[64] But see Sayce (<span class="ital">The Higher Criticism and the Monuments</span>, p. 470), who points out that “in the contract tablets which have been discovered under the soil of Babylonia we occasionally find the names of Jews, and in some instances these Jews are associated with persons evidently of the same nationality, but who have adopted, if not the beliefs, at all events the divine names of the Babylonian religion.” He adds instances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[65] <span class="ital">Persica</span>, xxvii.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the son of Jair etc.</span>] These names may denote respectively Mordecai’s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. It is better, however, to consider Shimei and Kish to be the well-known members of the tribe of Benjamin, the former appearing in the history of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm" title="And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.">2 Samuel 16:5</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-8.htm" title="And, behold, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.">1 Kings 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/2-36.htm" title="And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build you an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth there any where....">1 Kings 2:36-46</a>), and the latter as father of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm" title="Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-51.htm" title="And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.">1 Samuel 14:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>). Thus only these <span class="ital">prominent</span> links are mentioned in tracing the descent, it being a frequent practice among the Jews to omit less important members of a genealogy. Jewish tradition, accordingly, as expressed in the Targum on this passage, identifies Shimei with the enemy of David. Josephus takes the same view, as is shewn by his statement that Esther, Mordecai’s cousin, was of royal descent, thus referring to Kish in his relationship to Saul. See further in note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-1.htm" title="After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.">Esther 3:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now in Shushan... there was a certain Jew</span>. Hitherto the narrative has been a mere story of the Persian court. Now at last a Jew is brought on the scene, very abruptly; and the history is to a certain extent attached to the other sacred books, and assigned its place, by the genealogy which follows. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name was Mordecai</span>. The name Mordecai must almost certainly be connected with that of Marduk, or Merodach, the Babylonian and Assyrian god. But it may have been given to his son by a Baby-Ionian Jew without any thought of its derivation or meaning, perhaps out of compliment to a Babylonian friend or master. Another Mordecai, also a Jew, is mentioned by Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>) and Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-7.htm">Nehemiah 7:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/esther/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The saying pleased the king and the princes, and the king carried it into execution. He sent letters into all his provinces to make known his commands, and to let all husbands know, that they were to bear rule in their own houses. "In every province according to its writing, and to every people according to their speech" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>), that his will might be clearly understood by all the subjects of his wide domain, who spoke different languages and used different alphabetical characters. The contents of these letters follow in &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, that every man should be master in his own house. These words state only the chief matter and object of the edict; but they presuppose that the fact which gave rise to the decree, viz., the refusal of Vashti, and her consequent deposition, were also mentioned. The last words: "and that he shall speak according to the language of his people," are obscure. Older expositors understand them to mean, that every man was to speak only his native language in his house, so that in case he had a foreign wife, or several who spoke other languages, they might be obliged to learn his language, and to use that alone. Bertheau, on the other hand, objects that such a sense is but imported into the words, and in no wise harmonizes with the context. Both these assertions are, however, unfounded. In the words, the man shall speak according to the language of his people, i.e., he shall speak his native tongue in his house, it is implied that no other language was to be used in the house, and the application of this law to foreign wives is obvious from the context. The rule of the husband in the house was to be shown by the fact, that only the native tongue of the head of the house was to be used in the family. Thus in a Jewish family the Ashdodite or any other language of the wife's native land could not have been used, as we find to have been the case in Judaea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>). All other explanations are untenable, as has been already shown by Baumgarten, p. 20; and the conjecture set up after Hitzig by Bertheau, that instead of &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; we should read &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;, every one shall speak what becomes him, gives not only a trivial, and not at all an appropriate thought, but is refuted even by the fact that not &#1506;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;, but only &#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8</a>) could bear the meaning: to be becoming to any one. Such a command may, indeed, appear strange to us; but the additional particular, that every man was to speak his native tongue, and to have it alone spoken, in his own house, is not so strange as the fact itself that an edict should be issued commanding that the husband should be master in the house, especially in the East, where the wife is so accustomed to regard the husband as lord and master. Xerxes was, however, the author of many strange facts besides this. </body></html>
