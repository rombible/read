Here we see the danger and infelicity of the greatest men, the life of a most potent monarch depending upon the fidelity of one single person, whose service was neglected by the court, though a memorial was made of it.

Thus, with respect to those who serve Christ, though their recompence is not till the resurrection of the just, yet an account is kept of their work of faith and labour of love, which God is not unrighteous to forget. The servant of God must be faithful to every trust, and watchful for those who employ him. If he appear to be neglected now, he will be remembered hereafter.

In those days &#8230; two of the king's chamberlains &#8230; were wroth and sought to lay hand on the king, &c.&#8212;This secret conspiracy against the king's life probably arose out of revenge for the divorce of Vashti, in whose interest, and at whose instigation, these eunuchs may have acted. Through the vigilance of Mordecai, whose fidelity, however, passed unnoticed, the design was frustrated, while the conspirators were condemned to be executed and as the matter was recorded in the court annals, it became the occasion afterwards of Mordecai's preferment to the place of power and influence for which, in furtherance of the national interests of the Jews, divine providence intended him.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This may be referred, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Such was the form of capital punishment inflicted upon political offenders in Persia (Herod. iii. 159, iv. 43).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the book of the chronicles</span>] Herodotus (viii. 90) tells us that historiographers were attached to Xerxes’ court, and moved with it from place to place. Thus these chronicles recorded facts and events of State importance. Doubtless they were written on materials more perishable than the burnt clay tablets, which have been found in the vicinity of Babylon and elsewhere, and which have fortunately transmitted to us public occurrences of their time. Ctesias (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-2.htm" title="That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,">Esther 1:2</a>) pretended that records set down by Persian chroniclers were the sources from which he drew his information. We may compare the <span class="ital">acta diurna</span> of the Roman Empire, referred to in Tacitus (<span class="ital">Ann.</span> xiii. 31). The ‘chronicles’ mentioned in the text here are referred to again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-1.htm" title="On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.">Esther 6:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/10-2.htm" title="And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?">Esther 10:2</a>.

The subsequent history shows that Mordecai's information was found to be correct, since he was ultimately adjudged to have deserved the highest possible reward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-6.htm">Esther 6:6-10</a>). The two conspirators were condemned to death and <span class="cmt_word">hanged on a tree</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> crucified or impaled, as traitors and rebels commonly were in Persia (see Herod., 3 159; 4:43; 'Behist. Inscr.,' col. 2. pars. 13, 14; col. 3. par. 8). <span class="cmt_word">And it was written in the book of the chronicles</span>. Historiographers were attached to the Persian court, and attended the monarch wherever he went. We find them noting down facts for Xerxes at Doriscus (Herod., 7:100), and again at Salamis (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 8:90). They kept a record something like the <span class="accented">acta diurna</span> of the early Roman empire (Tacit., 'Ann.,' 13:31), and specially noted whatever concerned the king. Ctesias pretended to have drawn his Persian history from these "chronicles" (<span class="accented">up.</span> Diod. Sic., 2:32), and Herodotus seems to have obtained access to some of them (see the writer's 'Herodotus,' Introduction, ch. 1.h p. 56). <span class="cmt_word">Before the king</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in the king's presence."
