Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The house of the women - i. e. the "gynaeceon," or "haram" - always an essential part of an Oriental palace (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm">1 Kings 7:8</a>). In the Persian palaces it was very extensive, since the monarchs maintained, besides their legitimate wives, as many as 300 or 400 concubines (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-14.htm">Esther 2:14</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Es 2:1-20. Esther Chosen to Be Queen.<p>1-3. After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased&#8212;On recovering from the violent excitement of his revelry and rage, the king was pierced with poignant regret for the unmerited treatment he had given to his beautiful and dignified queen. But, according to the law, which made the word of a Persian king irrevocable, she could not be restored. His counsellors, for their own sake, were solicitous to remove his disquietude, and hastened to recommend the adoption of all suitable means for gratifying their royal master with another consort of equal or superior attractions to those of his divorced queen. In the despotic countries of the East the custom obtains that when an order is sent to a family for a young damsel to repair to the royal palace, the parents, however unwilling, dare not refuse the honor for their daughter; and although they know that when she is once in the royal harem, they will never see her again, they are obliged to yield a silent and passive compliance. On the occasion referred to, a general search was commanded to be made for the greatest beauties throughout the empire, in the hope that, from their ranks, the disconsolate monarch might select one for the honor of succeeding to the royal honors of Vashti. The damsels, on arrival at the palace, were placed under the custody of "Hege, the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women," that is, the chief eunuch, usually a repulsive old man, on whom the court ladies are very dependent, and whose favor they are always desirous to secure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/esther/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti,....

After this argument on the queen's conduct, follows the proposal: "If it please the king (&#1506;&#1500; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>), let there go from him a word of the kingdom (i.e., a royal edict), and let it be written (entered) in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, and not pass away, that Vashti come no more before King Ahashverosh; and let the king give her queenship (her royal rank) to another who is better than she." An edict issued by the king, entered among the laws of the Persians and Medes, and sealed with the royal signet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>), does not pass away, i.e., remains in force, is irrevocable (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-9.htm">Daniel 6:9</a>). The counsellors press for the issue of such an edict, for the purpose of making it impossible to the king to take Vashti again into favour, lest they should experience her vengeance on the restoration of her influence. &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, her companion, is any other woman, Vashti being here regarded merely as a woman. &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; includes both beauty and good behaviour (Berth.). By this means, add the counsellors in <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-20.htm">Esther 1:20</a>, all the ill effects of Vashti's contumacy will be obviated. "And when the king's decree, which he shall make, is heard in his whole kingdom, for it is great, all wives shall give honour to their husbands, from great to small." &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503; is according to the Keri to be pointed as the constructive state, &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;. The expression &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503; is explained by the circumstance, that &#1508;&#1514;&#1490;&#1501; signifies not only edict, decree, but also thing (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16</a>): to do a thing. In the present verse also it might be so understood: when the thing is heard which the king will do in his whole kingdom. The parenthetical clause, for it is great, is intended to flatter the king's vanity, and induce an inclination to agree to the proposal. "From great to small" signifies high and low, old and young. </body></html>
