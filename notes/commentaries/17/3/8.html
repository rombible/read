Let us be thankful for mild and just government. Haman inquires, according to his own superstitions, how to find a lucky day for the designed massacre! God's wisdom serves its own purposes by men's folly. Haman has appealed to the lot, and the lot, by delaying the execution, gives judgment against him. The event explains the doctrine of a particular providence over all the affairs of men, and the care of God over his church. Haman was afraid lest the king's conscience should smite him for what he had done; to prevent which, he kept him drinking. This cursed method many often take to drown convictions, and to harden their own hearts, and the hearts of others, in sin. All appeared in a favourable train to accomplish the project. But though sinners are permitted to proceed to the point they aim at, an unseen but almighty Power turns them back. How vain and contemptible are the strongest assaults against Jehovah! Had Haman obtained his wish, and the Jewish nation perished, what must have become of all the promises? How could the prophecies concerning the great Redeemer of the world have been fulfilled? Thus the everlasting covenant itself must have failed, before this diabolical project could take place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the first month ... - i. e. in March or April of 474 B.C.<p>"Pur" is supposed to be an old Persian word etymologically connected with the Latin "pars", and signifying "part" or "lot." The practice of casting lots to obtain a lucky day still obtains in the East, and is probably extremely ancient. A lot seems to have been cast, or a throw of some kind made, for each day of the month and each month of the year. The day and month which obtained the best throws were then selected. Assyrian calendars note lucky and unlucky days as early as the eighth century B.C. Lots were in use both among the Oriental and the Classical nations from a remote antiquity.<p>"Adar," the twelfth month, corresponds nearly to our March. It seems to have derived its name from "adar", "splendor," because of the brightness of the sun and the flowers at that time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. In the first month &#8230; they cast Pur, that is, the lot&#8212;In resorting to this method of ascertaining the most auspicious day for putting his atrocious scheme into execution, Haman acted as the kings and nobles of Persia have always done, never engaging in any enterprise without consulting the astrologers, and being satisfied as to the lucky hour. Vowing revenge but scorning to lay hands on a single victim, he meditated the extirpation of the whole Jewish race, who, he knew, were sworn enemies of his countrymen; and by artfully representing them as a people who were aliens in manners and habits, and enemies to the rest of his subjects, he procured the king's sanction of the intended massacre. One motive which he used in urging his point was addressed to the king's cupidity. Fearing lest his master might object that the extermination of a numerous body of his subjects would seriously depress the public revenue, Haman promised to make up the loss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There is a certain people, </span> mean and contemptible, not worthy to be named. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dispersed among the people; </span> who therefore, if tolerated, may poison all thy subjects with their pernicious principles; and whom thou mayst easily crush without any great noise or difficulty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In all the provinces of thy kingdom; </span> for though many of their brethren were returned to their own land, yet great numbers of them staid behind, either because they preferred their ease and worldly commodities before their spiritual advantages, or because they wanted conveniency or opportunity for a remove, which might happen from divers causes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Their laws are diverse from all people; </span> they have peculiar and fantastical rites, and customs, and religion; and therefore are justly offensive to all thy people, and may either infect them with their conceits, or occasion great dissensions and distractions among them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither keep they the kings laws; </span> as is manifest by Mordecai’s bold contempt of thy late edict concerning me, which being done by him as a Jew, the whole nation are involved in his crime, and are prepared to do so when they have occasion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It is not for the king’s profit to suffer them</span> to live in his kingdom.

Many had acted to the full upon the advice given them by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-5.htm" title="Build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;">Jeremiah 29:5</a> ff.) to make homes for themselves in exile. This passage in Esther points out that they were widely scattered through the Persian dominions, and therefore although, as the tone of Haman’s speech intends to convey, despicable in themselves, nevertheless capable of much mischief. The Book of Tobit (the date of which, though it cannot be fixed with certainty, may at any rate be taken as pre-Maccabean) speaks of settlements of Jews at Rages (in Media) and at Ecbatana (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-14.htm" title="And the next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)">Esther 1:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-1.htm" title="So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.">Esther 7:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">their laws are diverse from</span> those of <span class="ital">every people</span>] The author of the Book may have had in mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-6.htm" title="Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people....">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>, where this diversity is claimed as a witness to the wisdom of the people.[68] With Haman’s charge here, implying, as it does, an almost necessary disloyalty on the part of the Jews towards the king, we may compare that addressed to the Persian court by Rehum and Shimshai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/4-12.htm" title="Be it known to the king, that the Jews which came up from you to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations....">Ezra 4:12-16</a>) against the Jews of the Return. In neither case was there any substantial basis for the charge. If we were to accept the historical character of the narrative, we might say that dissatisfaction arising from the Persian reverses in the late war smoothed the way for a popular agitation, though altogether unreasonable, of the kind which Haman desired.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[68] For the expansion of this verse in the hands of a Jewish commentator, see Additional Note III, p. 72, <span class="ital">Targum Shçnî</span> (2nd extract).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the king’s profit</span>] rather, as marg., <span class="ital">meet for the king</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to suffer them</span>] to let them alone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>SECOND SPECIMEN OF THE SECOND TARGUM (TARGUM SHENI) ON ESTHER<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-8.htm" title="And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.">Esther 3:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[The passage is of interest, as no doubt representing the charges brought against Jews by their Gentile neighbours at the time when the Targum was written.]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people of the Jews scattered and dispersed among the peoples of every province of the kingdom; proud and haughty in spirit, collecting melting snows in winter[93], and putting them in summer pitchers[94], and their customs are different from those of every people and their laws from those of every province, and they do not adapt themselves to our laws, and they are not minded to conform to our customs, and they refuse to do service to the king; and when they see us, they spit upon the ground and look upon us as something unclean; and when we go to speak to them and demand of them some service to the king, they climb over walls and break through fences, and disappear into rooms, and make their escape through gaps; and when we run to lay hold of them, they turn round and stand with flashing eyes and gnash with their teeth and stamp with their feet, and they frighten us and we cannot lay hold of them.
