Whether Mordecai also rebelled against the ignominious character of the obeisance, we cannot say.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/esther/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-2.htm" title="And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him.

There was therefore, probably, more implied in the reverence commanded to be paid to him than what proceeded from a mere civil respect. The kings of Persia, we know, required a kind of divine adoration from all who approached them; and, as they arrogated this to themselves, so they sometimes imparted it to their chief friends and favourites, which seems to have been the case with regard to Haman at this time. And if so, we need not wonder that a righteous Jew should deny that honour, or the outward expressions of it, to any man; since the wise and sober Grecians positively refused to give it to their very kings themselves, the people of Athens once passing sentence of death on one Timocrates, a citizen of theirs, for prostrating himself before Darius, though he was then one of the greatest monarchs upon earth. The author of the apocryphal additions to the book of Esther seems to imply that this was the case of Mordecai, whom he introduces praying thus, chap. Est 13:12, &c. “Thou knowest, O Lord, that it is not in contempt, or pride, nor for any desire of glory, that I did not bow down to proud Haman, for I would willingly kiss his feet for the salvation of Israel; but I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of man to the glory of God, nor adore any one but thee my Lord alone.” See <span class="ital">Valer. Max., </span>lib. 6, cap. 3. We may observe further here, that Mordecai should refuse to pay such obeisance, as all others paid to Haman at this time, will appear the less strange, if we consider that Haman being of that nation against which God pronounced a curse, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>,) Mordecai might think himself, on this account, not obliged to pay him the reverence which he expected; and if the rest of the Jews had the like notion of him, this might be a reason sufficient for his extending his resentment against the whole nation. See Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Mordecai refused to reverence Haman. The religion of a Jew forbade him to give honours to any mortal man which savoured of idolatry, especially to so wicked a man as Haman. By nature all are idolaters; self is our favourite idol, we are pleased to be treated as if every thing were at our disposal. Though religion by no means destroys good manners, but teaches us to render honour to whom honour is due, yet by a citizen of Zion, not only in his heart, but in his eyes, such a vile person as Haman was, is contemned, Ps 15:4. The true believer cannot obey edicts, or conform to fashions, which break the law of God. He must obey God rather than man, and leave the consequences to him. Haman was full of wrath. His device was inspired by that wicked spirit, who has been a murderer from the beginning; whose enmity to Christ and his church, governs all his children.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mordecai probably refused the required prostration, usual though it was, on religious grounds. Hence, his opposition led on to his confession that he was a Jew <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-4.htm">Esther 3:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman&#8212;Large mansions in the East are entered by a spacious vestibule, or gateway, along the sides of which visitors sit, and are received by the master of the house; for none, except the nearest relatives or special friends, are admitted farther. There the officers of the ancient king of Persia waited till they were called, and did obeisance to the all-powerful minister of the day.<p>But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence&#8212;The obsequious homage of prostration not entirely foreign to the manners of the East, had not been claimed by former viziers; but this minion required that all subordinate officers of the court should bow before him with their faces to the earth. But to Mordecai, it seemed that such an attitude of profound reverence was due only to God. Haman being an Amalekite, one of a doomed and accursed race, was, doubtless, another element in the refusal; and on learning that the recusant was a Jew, whose nonconformity was grounded on religious scruples, the magnitude of the affront appeared so much the greater, as the example of Mordecai would be imitated by all his compatriots. Had the homage been a simple token of civil respect, Mordecai would not have refused it; but the Persian kings demanded a sort of adoration, which, it is well known, even the Greeks reckoned it degradation to express. As Xerxes, in the height of his favoritism, had commanded the same honors to be given to the minister as to himself, this was the ground of Mordecai's refusal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The reason of which obstinate refusal was, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The quality of the person; that he was not only an infamously wicked man, and a heathen, but of that nation which God had obliged the Israelites to abhor and oppose from generation to generation; and therefore he durst not show outward respect to a man whom he did and ought inwardly to contemn. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The nature of the thing; for the worship required was not only civil, but Divine; which as the kings of Persia did undoubtedly arrogate to themselves, and expect and receive from their subjects and others who came into their presence, as is affirmed by divers authors; so they did sometimes impart this honour to some of their chief favourites, that they should be adored in like manner. And that it was so here seems more than probable, because it was wholly superfluous, and almost ridiculous, to give an express and particular command to all the king’s servants that were in the king’ s gate, as here it was, to pay a civil respect to so great a prince, which of course they used and were ever obliged to do; and therefore a Divine honour must be here intended. And that a Jew should deny this honour, or the outward expressions of it, to such a person, is not strange, seeing the wise and sober Grecians did positively refuse to give this honour to the kings of Persia themselves, even when they were to make their addresses to them; and one Timocrates was put to death by the Athenians for worshipping Darius in that manner. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/esther/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king's servants that were in the king's gate,....

It may have been that Haman’s elevation was so strongly contrasted with his origin that there was occasion for the order to be issued.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But Mordecai bowed not down</span>] What was his reason? Although we have Greeks (Spartan ambassadors) refusing to bow down to the Persian monarch (Herod. vii. 136) on the ground that it was not their custom to worship men, yet the Jews had no objection to the act in itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.">2 Samuel 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-28.htm" title="And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well.

And the king said, What would you?">1 Kings 1:16</a>), and disobedience to the king’s direction in such a matter was fraught with danger.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Two possible answers suggest themselves. (1) He considered Haman as the king’s representative, and, as the Persian obeisance to the sovereign involved a belief that he was in some sort an incarnation of the Deity, Mordecai, as a Jew, refused to perform an act of idolatry. If so, however, we do not see how he could avoid bowing down, whenever he happened to be in the presence of the king himself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-1.htm" title="On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.">Esther 8:1</a>. (2) Mordecai, as a Jew, refused to bow down to the hereditary enemy of Israel. See last note and cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-7.htm" title="He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.">Numbers 24:7</a>. A characteristic piece of Targum says that the king’s servants pointed out to Mordecai that a conspicuous ancestor of his, Jacob, had bowed down before one of Haman’s forefathers, Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-3.htm" title="And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.">Genesis 33:3</a>). Mordecai, however, replied that he himself was not involved in this act, as being descended from Benjamin who at the time referred to was not yet born.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the king's servants</span>. Literally, "the king's slaves" - the lower officers of the court, porters and others, of about the same rank as Mordecai. <span class="cmt_word">Bowed and reverenced Haman</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prostrated themselves before him in the usual Oriental fashion. <span class="cmt_word">For the king had so commanded</span>. No reason is assigned for this order, which was certainly unusual, since the prostration of an inferior before a superior was a general rule (Herod., 1:134). Perhaps Haman had been elevated from a very low position, and the king therefore thought a special order requisite. <span class="cmt_word">Mordecai bowed not</span>. Greeks occasionally refused to prostrate themselves before the Great King himself, saying that it was not their custom to worship men (Herod., 7:136; Plut., 'Vit. Artax.,' &sect; 22; Arrian., 'Exp. Alex.,' 4:10-12, etc.). Mordecai seems to have had the same feeling. Prostration was, he thought, an act of worship, and it was not proper to worship any one excepting God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/esther/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19-23</a> relate the intervention of an incident of great importance in the subsequent development of the narrative. When virgins were for the second time gathered together, two courtiers were incensed with the king, and sought to lay hands upon him. This thing was known to Mordochai, who sat in the gate of the palace and kept up a constant communication with Esther even after she became queen, and by him communicated to her, that she might bring it to the knowledge of the king. The matter being investigated and found to have been truly reported, the offenders were punished, and an entry of the particulars made in the chronicles of the kingdom. The words "when virgins were assembled for the second time," which serve to define the time when the conspiracy of the two courtiers took place, as is obvious from the circumstance that &#1492;&#1492;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21</a>, refers to &#1489;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1509;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a>, are obscure. The obscurity lies in the fact that no reason for assembling virgins can be perceived, after the choice of Ahashverosh had fallen upon Esther. The sentence &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1509; unmistakeably corresponds with &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1509; of v. 8. This was already rightly perceived by Grotius, who, however, wrongly infers: est &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (retrogressio), referendum enim hoc ad illa quae supra, ii. 2. This is, however, not only incompatible with &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, but also with the circumstance that, according to the correct understanding of the sentences in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-22.htm">Esther 2:22</a>, Esther was then already queen, and Mordochai was sitting in the gate of the king's palace, and thence keeping up communication with her; while as long as Esther was in the women's house preparing for her interview with the king, under the guardianship of Hegai, he walked day by day before the court of the women's house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-11.htm">Esther 2:11</a>). Still less admissible is the view of Drusius, received by Bertheau, that the gathering of the virgins for the second time is to be understood from the circumstance, that after going in to the king, they had to go into the second house of the women, under the stricter guardianship of Shaashgaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-14.htm">Esther 2:14</a>). For, being no longer &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, but &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-14.htm">Esther 2:14</a>), their reception into the house of the concubines could not be called a second gathering together, since as virgins they were formerly in a different house. The only explanation of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; left us is the view, that even after the choice of Esther to be queen, a second gathering together of virgins actually took place; for this, as C. a Lapide remarks, is what the words undoubtedly declare. The matter itself was in accordance with the prevailing custom of polygamy, which kings carried to such an extent, that, as C. a Lapide points out, Solomon, e.g., had 700 wives and 300 concubines, i.e., secondarias uxores. From &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a>, onwards, explanatory circumstantial clauses follow: "The Mordochai sat in the king's gate" introduces the parenthetical sentence, "Esther had not yet showed her kindred and her people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-10.htm">Esther 2:10</a>), as Mordochai had charged her; for Esther did the commandment of Mordochai as when she was under his care;" i.e., Esther obeyed, after her elevation to be queen, the command of Mordochai not to make her Jewish descent known, as she had formerly done while she was yet his foster-daughter. &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, care, education, is a substantive derived from &#1488;&#1502;&#1503;. </body></html>
