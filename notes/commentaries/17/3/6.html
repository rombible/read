The religion of a Jew forbade him to give honours to any mortal man which savoured of idolatry, especially to so wicked a man as Haman. By nature all are idolaters; self is our favourite idol, we are pleased to be treated as if every thing were at our disposal. Though religion by no means destroys good manners, but teaches us to render honour to whom honour is due, yet by a citizen of Zion, not only in his heart, but in his eyes, such a vile person as Haman was, is contemned, Ps 15:4. The true believer cannot obey edicts, or conform to fashions, which break the law of God. He must obey God rather than man, and leave the consequences to him. Haman was full of wrath. His device was inspired by that wicked spirit, who has been a murderer from the beginning; whose enmity to Christ and his church, governs all his children.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To destroy all the Jews - In the East massacres of a people, a race, a class, have at all times been among the incidents of history, and would naturally present themselves to the mind of a statesman. The Magophonia, or the great massacre of the Magi at the accession of Darius Hystaspis, was an event not then fifty years old, and was commemorated annually. A massacre of the Scythians had occurred about a century previously. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman&#8212;Large mansions in the East are entered by a spacious vestibule, or gateway, along the sides of which visitors sit, and are received by the master of the house; for none, except the nearest relatives or special friends, are admitted farther. There the officers of the ancient king of Persia waited till they were called, and did obeisance to the all-powerful minister of the day.<p>But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence&#8212;The obsequious homage of prostration not entirely foreign to the manners of the East, had not been claimed by former viziers; but this minion required that all subordinate officers of the court should bow before him with their faces to the earth. But to Mordecai, it seemed that such an attitude of profound reverence was due only to God. Haman being an Amalekite, one of a doomed and accursed race, was, doubtless, another element in the refusal; and on learning that the recusant was a Jew, whose nonconformity was grounded on religious scruples, the magnitude of the affront appeared so much the greater, as the example of Mordecai would be imitated by all his compatriots. Had the homage been a simple token of civil respect, Mordecai would not have refused it; but the Persian kings demanded a sort of adoration, which, it is well known, even the Greeks reckoned it degradation to express. As Xerxes, in the height of his favoritism, had commanded the same honors to be given to the minister as to himself, this was the ground of Mordecai's refusal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/esther/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He thought scorn; </span> he thought that particular vengeance was unsuitable to his quality, and to the greatness of the injury. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Haman sought to destroy all the Jews; </span> which he attempted, partly, from that implacable hatred which, as an Amalekite, he had against them; partly, from his rage against Mordecai; and partly, from Mordecai’s reason of this contempt, because he was a Jew, which, as he truly judged, extended itself to all the Jews, and would equally engage them all in the same neglect and hatred of his person, <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/esther/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone,....

The whole nation to which his enemy belonged must perish. A little more than forty years previously, at the accession of Darius Hystaspes, there had been a general massacre of the Magi, when the people “slew every Magus who came in their way” (Herod. iii. 79). This and other instances[67] which might be adduced illustrate the tendency towards passionate and excessive vengeance on the part of the Oriental disposition, which holds human life cheap. Some, however, have seen in Haman’s conduct the operation of a wider principle in the shape of race-hatred, paralleled in later days by anti-semitic outbursts upon the continent, or the persecution of Eastern Christians by the Turks.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[67] For example, when Cyaxares and the Medes invite to a banquet a large number of Scythians, whose depredations had proved troublesome, and massacre them when drunk (Herod. i. 106).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone</span>. If Haman had simply said to Ahasuerus, "There is one of your menials who persistently disobeys a royal edict, and at the same time insults me," Ahasuerus would, as a matter of course, have told him to put the menial to death. But the revengeful temper of the man was such that this seemed to him insufficient. Mordecai had insulted him as a Jew, and the Jews should pay the penalty. Mordecai should be punished not only in person, but in his kindred, if he had any, and in his nation. The nation itself was contumacious and troublesome (ver. 8); it would be well to get rid of it. And it would be a grand thing to wipe out an insult offered by an individual in the blood of a whole people. Haman therefore <span class="cmt_word">sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus</span>. Massacres on a large scale - not unknown in the West, witness St. Bartholomew's - are of frequent occurrence in the East, where human life is not held in much regard, and the caprices of absolute monarchs determine the course of history. There had been a general massacre of the Magi upon the accession of Darius Hystaspis, the father of Xerxes (Herod., 3:79), and one of Scythians about a century before (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 1.106). These were examples which might occur to Haman. A later one is the Roman massacre of Mithridates in  <span class="date">B.C. 88</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 3:7-15 HAMAN CASTS LOTS TO OBTAIN A LUCKY DAY FOR HIS ENTERPRISE, AND OBTAINS A DAY IN THE MONTH ADAR, THE LAST MONTH OF THE YEAR (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>). Having determined on a general massacre of the Jews on a given day, as the best mode of ridding the empire of them, Haman thought it of supreme importance, to select for the massacre a propitious and fortunate day. Lucky and unlucky days are recognised generally throughout the East; and it is a wide-spread practice, when any affair of consequence is taken in hand, to obtain a determination of the time for commencing it, or carrying it into effect, by calling in the arbitrement of Chance. Haman had recourse to "the lot," and by means of it obtained, as the fight day for his purpose, the 13th of Adar, which was more than ten months distant. The long delay was no doubt unpalateable, but he thought himself bound to submit to it, and took his further measures accordingly. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/esther/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The definition of time in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a> is again take up by the words: in those days; then the explanatory clause, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-20.htm">Esther 2:20</a>, is repeated; and after this we are informed what it was that had then occurred. In those days Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's courtiers, who were the threshold-keepers (palace-watchers, lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), were wroth, and sought to lay hands on King Ahashverosh, i.e., to slay him. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-22.htm">Esther 2:22</a>. This thing was known to Mordochai, and by him communicated to Esther, who told it, in Mordochai's name, to the king. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-23.htm">Esther 2:23</a>. The matter was investigated (sc. by the king), and found out, sc. as Mordochai had testified. The two criminals were hanged on a tree, i.e., impaled on a stake, a sort of crucifixion, - see rem. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-11.htm">Esther 6:11</a>, - and the circumstance entered in the book of the chronicles, i.e., the chronicles of the kingdom. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, before the king, i.e., in his presence, immediately after sentence had been passed by a court over which the monarch presided. </body></html>
