The king perhaps was glad to throw the cares of government on his minister, and, too indolent to form an opinion for himself, was content to believe that the Jews were a worthless, disloyal people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/esther/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-11.htm" title="And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.">Esther 3:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">The silver is given to thee — </span>Keep it for thy own use, I do not desire it.

Let us be thankful for mild and just government. Haman inquires, according to his own superstitions, how to find a lucky day for the designed massacre! God's wisdom serves its own purposes by men's folly. Haman has appealed to the lot, and the lot, by delaying the execution, gives judgment against him. The event explains the doctrine of a particular providence over all the affairs of men, and the care of God over his church. Haman was afraid lest the king's conscience should smite him for what he had done; to prevent which, he kept him drinking. This cursed method many often take to drown convictions, and to harden their own hearts, and the hearts of others, in sin. All appeared in a favourable train to accomplish the project. But though sinners are permitted to proceed to the point they aim at, an unseen but almighty Power turns them back. How vain and contemptible are the strongest assaults against Jehovah! Had Haman obtained his wish, and the Jewish nation perished, what must have become of all the promises? How could the prophecies concerning the great Redeemer of the world have been fulfilled? Thus the everlasting covenant itself must have failed, before this diabolical project could take place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The silver is given to thee - Some understand this to mean that Xerxes refused the silver which Haman had offered to him; but the passage is better explained as a grant to him of all the property of such Jews as should be executed <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/esther/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman&#8212;There was a seal or signet in the ring.

In the East, confiscation of goods is the invariable accompaniment of capital punishment, and they are forfeited to the crown. At first sight the words seem to mean that the king declines Haman’s offer, and gives him free leave to massacre the Jews, and plunder them for his own benefit. But probably it is implied that the promised payment to the king was to be made out of the spoils. It is clear that the information which Mordecai obtained assured him that the king’s treasuries were to receive the booty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-7.htm" title="And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.">Esther 4:7</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The silver is given thee, the people also</span>. Not "the silver which thou hast given me is given back to thee," for the 10,000 talents had not been given, but only offered. Rather, "the silver of the people is given thee, together with the people themselves, to do with both as it pleases thee." Confiscation always accompanies execution in the East, and the goods of those who are put to death naturally escheat to the crown, which either seizes them or makes a grant of them. Compare ch. 8:11, where the property of those of the Jews' enemies who should suffer death is granted to those who should slay them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/esther/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When, then, Haman, whose attention had been called to the fact, saw, when next he went in unto the king, that Mordochai did not fall down before him, he was full of wrath, and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-6.htm">Esther 3:6</a>) thought scorn, i.e., in his pride esteemed it too contemptible, to lay hands on Mordochai alone, i.e., to execute him alone, for this opposition to the royal commands; for they had showed him the people of Mordochai, i.e., had told him that as a Jew Mordochai had refused this act of worship, and that the whole Jewish nation thought and acted accordingly. Therefore he sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahashverosh, the people of Mordochai. The subject Haman is repeated before &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; for the sake of clearness, because it was not expressly named with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503;. &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497; &#1506;&#1501; is in apposition to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;: all the Jews as the people of Mordochai, because they were the people of Mordochai and shared his sentiments. </body></html>
