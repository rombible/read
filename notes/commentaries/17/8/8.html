Such a writing “may no man reverse.” Still he will do what he can. It may be possible to meet the difficulty, and save the Jews, without actual reversal of the decree. The king then refers to the proofs of his goodwill, as shown by hanging Haman for his scheme against the Jews, and giving his property to Esther, and bids Esther and Mordecai “write concerning the Jews according to what seems good in your eyes.” Give, that is, any orders you please about them, short of repealing the former order. The result of this permission, whether the idea was suggested by the king, or occurred to Esther or Mordecai, was that authority was given to the Jews to defend themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/esther/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-8.htm" title="Write you also for the Jews, as it likes you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.">Esther 8:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Write ye also for the Jews — </span>On their behalf, to the governors and commanders of the king’s forces, or to whom you please. <span class="ital">In the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring — </span>I offer you my authority and seal, to confirm whatsoever you shall think fit to write. <span class="ital">The writing which is written in the king’s name, &c., may no man reverse — </span>This reason may belong, either, 1st, To the writing of these present letters; and then the sense is, These letters will be most effectual, being no less irrevocable than the former, and, coming last, will repeal the former.

Esther, though safe herself, fell down and begged for the deliverance of her people. We read of no tears when she begged for her own life, but although she was sure of that, she wept for her people. Tears of pity and tenderness are the most Christ-like. According to the constitution of the Persian government, no law or decree could be repealed or recalled. This is so far from speaking to the wisdom and honour of the Medes and Persians, that it clearly shows their pride and folly. This savours of that old presumption which ruined all, We will be as gods! It is God's prerogative not to repent, or to say what can never be altered or unsaid. Yet a way was found, by another decree, to authorize the Jews to stand upon their defence. The decree was published in the languages of all the provinces. Shall all the subjects of an earthly prince have his decrees in languages they understand, and shall God's oracles and laws be locked up from any of his servants in an unknown tongue?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/esther/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Write ... as it liketh you ... - (See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-19.htm">Esther 1:19</a> note.
