How much of our knowledge of God is merely hearsay? and it is not till the experimental teaching of the Holy Ghost has revealed God to our consciences that we really see Him with the inward eye. The confession of Job, therefore, is the confession of every converted man. Compare in a much later and very different, and yet analogous sphere, the confession of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/42.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-4.htm" title="Hear, I beseech you, and I will speak: I will demand of you, and declare you to me.">Job 42:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Hear, I beseech thee — </span>Hear and accept my humble and penitent confession. <span class="ital">I will demand of thee — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">אשׁאלךְ</span>, <span class="ital">eshaleka, interrogabo te, I will inquire, ask, </span>or <span class="ital">make my petition to thee. </span>I will no more dispute the matter with thee, but beg information from thee.

When the understanding is enlightened by the Spirit of grace, our knowledge of Divine things as far exceeds what we had before, as the sight of the eyes excels report and common fame. By the teachings of men, God reveals his Son to us; but by the teachings of his Spirit he reveals his Son in us, Ga 1:16, and changes us into the same image, 2Co 3:18. It concerns us to be deeply humbled for the sins of which we are convinced. Self-loathing is ever the companion of true repentance. The Lord will bring those whom he loveth, to adore him in self-abasement; while true grace will always lead them to confess their sins without self-justifying.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak - This is the language of humble, docile submission. On former occasions he had spoken confidently and boldly of God; he had called in question the equity of his dealings with him; he had demanded that he might be permitted to carry his cause before him, and argue it there himself; Notes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, and notes <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20-22</a>. Now he is wholly changed. His is the submissive language of a docile child, and he begs to be permitted to sit down before God, and humbly to inquire of him what was truth. "This is true religion."<p>I will demand of thee - Or rather, "I will ask of thee." The word "demand" implies more than there is of necessity in the original word (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;  sha&#770;'al). That means simply "to ask," and it may be done with the deepest humility and desire of instruction. That was now the temper of Job.<p>And declare thou unto me - Job was not now disposed to debate the matter, or to enter into a controversy with God. He was willing to sit down and receive instruction from God, and earnestly desired that he would "teach" him of his ways. It should be added, that very respectable critics suppose that in this verse Job designs to make confession of the impropriety of his language on former occasions, in the presumptuous and irreverent manner in which he had demanded a trial of argument with God. It would then require to be rendered as a quotation from his own words formerly.<p>"I have indeed uttered what I understood not,<p>Things too wonderful for me, which I know not,<p>(When I said) Hear now, I will speak,<p>I will demand of thee, and do thou teach me"<p>This is adopted by Umbreit, and has much in its favor that is plausible; but on the whole the usual interpretation seems to be most simple and proper. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. When I said, "Hear," &c., Job's demand (Job 13:22) convicted him of being "without knowledge." God alone could speak thus to Job, not Job to God: therefore he quotes again God's words as the groundwork of retracting his own foolish words.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/42.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Hear and accept my humble and penitent confession and recantation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will demand of thee; </span> or, and <span class="ital">inquire</span>, to wit, counsel or instruction, as a scholar doth of his master, as the following words note.

The words are not an entreaty on the part of Job that the Almighty would further instruct him; they are a repetition of the words of the Lord (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-3.htm" title="Gird up now your loins like a man; for I will demand of you, and answer you me.">Job 38:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-7.htm" title="Gird up your loins now like a man: I will demand of you, and declare you to me.">Job 40:7</a>). The verse is closely connected with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm" title="I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye sees you.">Job 42:5</a></span>, which suggests under what feeling Job repeats the words of God to him.

(<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-4.htm" title="Hear, I beseech you, and I will speak: I will demand of you, and declare you to me.">Job 42:4</a></span>) that be far from me; I had heard of thee with the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee” (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm" title="I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye sees you.">Job 42:5</a></span>).
