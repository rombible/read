His troubles began in Satan's malice, which God restrained; his restoration began in God's mercy, which Satan could not oppose. Mercy did not return when Job was disputing with his friends, but when he was praying for them. God is served and pleased with our warm devotions, not with our warm disputes. God doubled Job's possessions. We may lose much for the Lord, but we shall not lose any thing by him. Whether the Lord gives us health and temporal blessings or not, if we patiently suffer according to his will, in the end we shall be happy. Job's estate increased. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; it is he that gives us power to get wealth, and gives success in honest endeavours.

But it was one of the bitter sources of his affliction, and one of the grounds of his complaint, that in his trials his kindred stood aloof from him; so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-14</a>, he says, "He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me." It is not easy to account for this. It may have been, however, that a part were kept from showing any sympathy, in accordance with the general fact that there are always professed friends, and sometimes kindred, who forsake a man in affliction; and that a part regarded him as abandoned by God, and forsook him on that account - from a mistaken view of what they regarded as duty, that they ought to forsake one whom God had forsaken. When his calamities had passed by, however, and he again enjoyed the tokens of the divine favor, all returned to him full of condolence and kindness; part, probably, because friends always cluster around one who comes out of calamity and rises again to honor, and the other portion because they supposed that as "God" regarded him now with approbation, it was proper for "them" to do it also. A man who has been unfortunate, and who is visited with returning prosperity, never lacks friends. The rising sun reveals many friends that darkness had driven away, or brings to light many - real or professed - who were concealed at midnight.<p>And did eat bread with him in his house - An ancient token of friendship and affection; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-1.htm">Jeremiah 41:1</a>.<p>And every man also gave him a piece of money - This is probably one of the earliest instances in which money is mentioned in history. It is, of course, impossible now to determine the form or value of the "piece of money" here referred to. The Hebrew word (&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;  qes&#769;&#305;&#770;yt&#803;a&#770;h), occurs only in this place and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>, where it is rendered "pieces of money," and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, where it is rendered "pieces of silver." It is evident, therefore, that it was one of the earliest names given to coin, and its use here is an argument that the book of Job is of very early origin. Had it been composed at a later age, the word "shekel," or some word in common use to denote money, would have been used. The Vulgate here renders the word "ovem," a sheep; the Septuagint in like manner, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;  amnada, "a lamb;" and so also the Chaldee. In the margin, in both the other places where the word occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, it is also rendered "lambs."<p>The reason why it is so rendered is unknown. it may have been supposed that in early times a sheep or lamb having something like a fixed value, might have been the standard by which to estimate the value of other things; but there is nothing in the etymology of the word to support this interpretation. The word in Arabic (kasat) means to divide out equally, to measure; and the Hebrew word probably had some such signification, denoting that which was measured or weighed out, and hence became the name of a certain "weight" or "amount" of money. It is altogether probable that the first money consisted of a certain amount of the precious metals "weighed out," without being "coined" in any way. It is not an improbable supposition, however, that the figure of a sheep or lamb was the first figure stamped on coins, and this may be the reason why the word used here was rendered in this manner in the ancient versions. On the meaning of the word, Bochart may be consulted, "Hieroz." P. i. Lib. c. xliii. pp. 433-437; Rosenmuller on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; Schultens "in loc;" and the following work in Ugolin's "Thes. Antiq. Sacr." Tom. xxviii., "Otthonis Sperlingii Diss. de nummis non cusis," pp. 251-253, 298-306. The arguments of Bochart to prove that this word denotes a piece of money, and not a lamb, as it is rendered by the Vulgate, the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Arabic, and by Onkelos, are briefly:<p>(1) That in more than an hundred places where reference is made in the Scriptures to a lamb or a sheep, this word is not used. Other words are constantly employed.<p>(2) The testimony of the rabbis is uniform that it denotes a piece of money. Akiba says that when he traveled into Africa he found there a coin which they called kesita. So Rabbi Solomon, and Levi Ben Gerson, in their commentaries, and Kimchi, Pomarius, and Aquinas, in their Lexicons.<p>(3) The authority of the Masoretes in relation to the Hebrew word is the same. According to Bochart, the word is the same as &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;  qa&#772;shat&#803; or &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;  qoshet&#803;, changing the Hebrew letter &#1513;&#1473; for the Hebrew letter &#1513;&#1474;. The word means true, sincere, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-21.htm">Proverbs 22:21</a>. According to this, the name was given to the coin because it was made of pure metal - unadulterated silver or gold. See this argument at length in Bochart.<p>(4) The feminine form of the noun used here shows that it does not mean a lamb - it being wholly improbable that the friends of Job would send him ewe lambs only.<p>(5) In the early times of the patriarchs - as early as the time of Jacob - money was in common use, and the affairs of merchandise were conducted by that as a medium; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-16.htm">Genesis 47:16</a>.<p>(6) The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm">Acts 7:16</a>, leads to the supposition that "money" is referred to by the word as used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>. If, as is there supposed, the purchase of the same field is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a>, then it is clear that money is referred to by the word. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a> it is said that Abraham paid for the field of Ephron iu Macpelah "four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant." And if the same purchase is referred to in both these places, then by a comparison of the two, it appears that the kesita was heavier than the shekel, and contained about four shekels. It is not easy, however, to determine its value.<p>And every one an earring of gold - The word rendered "earring" (&#1504;&#1494;&#1501;  nezem) may mean a ring for the nose <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-47.htm">Genesis 24:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-21.htm">Isaiah 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-22.htm">Proverbs 11:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>, as well as for the ear, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>. The word "ring" would better express the sense here without specifying its particular use; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-24.htm">Judges 8:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-12.htm">Proverbs 25:12</a>. Ornaments of this kind were much worn by the ancients (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>), and a contribution of these from each one of the friends of Job would constitute a valuable property; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2-3</a>. It was not uncommon for friends thus to bring presents to one who was restored from great calamity. See the case of Hezekiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. It was Job's complaint in his misery that his "brethren," were "estranged" from him (Job 19:13); these now return with the return of his prosperity (Pr 14:20; 19:6, 7); the true friend loveth at all times (Pr 17:17; 18:24). "Swallow friends leave in the winter and return with the spring" [Henry].<p>eat bread&#8212;in token of friendship (Ps 41:9).<p>piece of money&#8212;Presents are usual in visiting a man of rank in the East, especially after a calamity (2Ch 32:23). Hebrew, kesita. Magee translates "a lamb" (the medium of exchange then before money was used), as it is in Margin of Ge 33:19; Jos 24:32. But it is from the Arabic kasat, "weighed out" [Umbreit], not coined; so Ge 42:35; 33:19; compare with Ge 23:15, makes it likely it was equal to four shekels; Hebrew kashat, "pure," namely, metal. The term, instead of the usual "shekel," &c., is a mark of antiquity.<p>earring&#8212;whether for the nose or ear (Ge 35:4; Isa 3:21).

Hitherto Jehovah has interrogated him, in order to bring him to a knowledge of his ignorance and weakness. Now, however, after he has thoroughly perceived this, he is anxious to put questions to Jehovah, in order to penetrate deeper and deeper into the knowledge of the divine power and wisdom. Now for the first time with him, the true, living perception of God has its beginning, being no longer effected by tradition (&#1500; of the external cause: in consequence of the tidings which came to my ears, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a>), but by direct communication with God.

Even Eichhorn and Bertholdt on this account suppose that the separate portions of the two speeches of Jehovah have fallen into disorder. Stuhlmann, Bernstein, and De Wette, on the other hand, explained the second half of the description of the leviathan, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12-34</a>, as a later interpolation; for this part is thought to be inflated, and to destroy the connection between Jehovah's concluding words, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm">Job 41:2-3</a>, and Job's answer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2-6</a>. Ewald forcibly rejected the whole section, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a>, by ascribing it to the writer of Elihu's speeches-an opinion which he has again more recently abandoned. In fact, this section ought to have had a third poet as its writer. But he would be the double (Doppelgnger) of the first; for, deducting the somewhat tame &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>, - which, however, is introduced by the interrupted description being resumed, in order now to begin in real earnest, - this section stands upon an equally exalted height with the rest of the book as a poetic production and lofty description; and since it has not only, as also Elihu's speeches, an Arabizing tinge, but also the poetic genius, the rich fountain of thought, the perfection of technical detail, in common with the rest of the book; and since the writer of the book of Job also betrays elsewhere an acquaintance with Egypt, and an especial interest in things Egyptian, the authenticity of the section is by no means doubted by us, but we freely adopt the originality of its present position.<p>But before one doubts the originality of its position, he ought, first of all, to make an earnest attempt to comprehend the portion in its present connection, into which it at any rate has not fallen from pure thoughtlessness. The first speech of Jehovah, moreover, was surprisingly different from what was to have been expected, and yet we recognised in it a deep consistency with the plan; perhaps the same thing is also the case in connection with the second.<p>After Job has answered the first speech of Jehovah by a confession of penitence, the second can have no other purpose but that of strengthening the conviction, which urges to this confession, and of deepening the healthful tone from which it proceeds. The object of censure here is no longer Job's contending with Jehovah in general, but Job's contending with Jehovah on account of the prosperity of the evil-doer, which is irreconcilable with divine justice; that contending by which the sufferer, in spite of the shadow which affliction casts upon him, supported the assertion of his own righteousness. Here also, as a result, the refutation follows in the only way consistent with the dignity of Jehovah, and so that Job must believe in order to perceive, and does not perceive in order not to be obliged to believe. Without arguing the matter with Job, as to why many things in the government of the world are thus and not rather otherwise, Jehovah challenges Job to take the government of the world into his own hand, and to give free course to his wrath, to cast down everything that is exalted, and to render the evil-doer for ever harmless. By thus thinking of himself as the ruler of the world, Job is obliged to recognise the cutting contrast of his feebleness and the divine rule, with which he has ventured to find fault; at the same time, however, he is taught, that - what he would never be able to do - God really punishes the ungodly, and must have wise purposes when, which He indeed might do, He does not allow the floods of His wrath to be poured forth immediately.<p>Thus far also Simson is agreed; but what is the design of the description of the two Egyptian monsters, which are regarded by him as by Ewald as out of place here? To show Job how little capable he is of governing the world, and how little he would be in a position to execute judgment on the evil-doer, two creatures are described to him, two unslain monsters of gigantic structure and invincible strength, which defy all human attack. These two descriptions are, we think, designed to teach Job how little capable of passing sentence upon the evil-doer he is, who cannot even draw a cord through the nose of the behmoth, and who, if he once attempted to attack the leviathan, would have reason to remember it so long as he lived, and would henceforth let it alone. It is perhaps an emblem that is not without connection with the book of Job, that these &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; (&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;), in the language of the Prophets and the Psalms, are the symbols of a worldly power at enmity with the God of redemption and His people. And wherefore should Job's confession, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>, not be suitably attached to the completed description of the leviathan, especially as the description is divided into two parts by the utterances of Jehovah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm">Job 41:2-3</a>, which retrospectively and prospectively set it in the right light for Job? </body></html>
