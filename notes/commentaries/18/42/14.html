His troubles began in Satan's malice, which God restrained; his restoration began in God's mercy, which Satan could not oppose. Mercy did not return when Job was disputing with his friends, but when he was praying for them. God is served and pleased with our warm devotions, not with our warm disputes. God doubled Job's possessions. We may lose much for the Lord, but we shall not lose any thing by him. Whether the Lord gives us health and temporal blessings or not, if we patiently suffer according to his will, in the end we shall be happy. Job's estate increased. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; it is he that gives us power to get wealth, and gives success in honest endeavours. The last days of a good man sometimes prove his best, his last works his best works, his last comforts his best comforts; for his path, like that of the morning light, shines more and more unto the perfect day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he called the name of the first, Jemima - It is remarkable that in the former account of the family of Job, the names of none of his children are mentioned, and in this account the names of the daughters only are designated. "Why" the names of the daughters are here specified, is not intimated. They are significant, and they are "so" mentioned as to show that they contributed greatly to the happiness of Job on the return of his prosperity, and were among the chief blessings which gladdened his old age. The name Jemima (&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;  yem&#305;&#770;yma&#770;h) is rendered by the Vulgate "Diem," and by the Septuagint, &#x397;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  He&#772;meran, "Day." The Chaldee adds this remark: "He gave her the name Jemima, because her beauty was like the day." The Vulgate, Septuagint, and Chaldee, evidently regarded the name as derived from &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;  yo&#770;m, "day," and this is the most natural and obvious derivation. The name thus conferred would indicate that Job had now emerged from the "night" of affliction, and that returning light shone again on his tabernacle. It was usual in the earliest periods to bestow names because they were significant of returning prosperity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>), or because they indicated hope of what would be in their time <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>, or because they were a pledge of some permanent tokens of the divine favor; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>. Thomas Roe remarks ("Travels," 425), that among the Persians it is common to give names to their daughters derived from spices, unguents, pearls, and precious stones, or anything which is regarded as beautiful or valuable. See Rosenmuller, "Alte u. neue Morgenland," No. 779.<p>And the name of the second Kezia - The name Kezia (&#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;  qets&#305;&#770;y&#8219;a&#770;h) means cassia, a bark resembling cinnamon, but less aromatic. "Gesenius." It grew in Arabia, and was used as a perfume. The Chaldee paraphrasist explains this as meaning that he gave her this name because "she was as precious as cassia." Cassia is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>. as among the precious perfumes. "All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia." The agreeableness or pleasantness of the perfume was the reason why the name was chosen to be given to a daughter.<p>And the name of the third, Keren-happuch - Properly, "horn of stibium." The "stibium" (&#1508;&#1493;&#1498;  pu&#770;k), was a paint or dye made originally, it is supposed, from sea-weed, and afterward from antimony, with which females tinged their eye-lashes; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11</a>. It was esteemed as an ornament of great beauty, chiefly because it served to make the eye appear larger. Large eyes are considered in the East as a mark of beauty, and the painting of black borders around them gives them an enlarged appearance. It is remarkable that this species of ornament was known so early as the time of Job, and this is one of the cases, constantly occurring in the East, showing that fashions there do not change. It is also remarkable that the fact of painting in this manner should have been considered so respectable as to be incorporated into the name of a daughter; and this shows that there was no attempt at "concealing" the habit. This also accords with the customs which prevail still in the East. With us, the materials and instruments of personal adorning are kept in the back-ground, but the Orientals obtrude them constantly on the attention, as objects adapted to suggest agreeable ideas. The "process" of painting the eye is described by a recent traveler to be this: "The eye is closed, and a small ebony rod smeared with the composition is squeezed between the lids so as to tinge the edges with the color. This is considered to add greatly to the brilliancy and power of the eye, and to deepen the effect of the long black eye-lashes of which the Orientals are proud. The same drug is employed on their eye-brows; used thus, it is intended to elongate, not to elevate the arc, so that the inner extremities are usually represented as meeting between the eyes. To Europeans the effect is at first seldom pleasing; but it soon becomes so." The foregoing cuts give a representation of the vessels of stibium now in use. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

That is, the name of the first and eldest daughter was called by Job Jemima; which either signifies "day", so the Targum interprets it, and most do, and so is the same with Diana; or, as Spanheim (u) observes, it may be the same with the Arabic word "jemama", which signifies a turtle or dove (w); and who also observes that a country in Arabia is so called, and perhaps from her; and which seems to be confirmed by the Arabic geographer (x), who speaks of a queen called Jamama, who dwelt in a city of the country he describes as being on the north of Arabia Felix, and also speaks of a way from thence to Bozrah in Edom; <p>and the name of the second, Kezia; or Cassia; an aromatic herb of a very fragrant smell, as we render the word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; and from this person the above learned writer conjectures Mount Casius in Arabia might have its name; <p>and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch; which signifies an horn or vessel of paint, such as the eastern women used to paint their faces, particularly their eyes with, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>; and as Jezebel did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>; or "the ray of a precious stone"; some say the carbuncle (y) or ruby; according to the Targum, the emerald; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>, the word is rendered "glittering stones". Now these names may have respect to Job's daughters themselves, to their external beauty, afterwards observed, so the Targum, <p>"he called the one Jemima, because her beauty was as the day; the other he called Kezia, because she was precious like cassia; and another he called Kerenhappuch, because great was the brightness of the glory of her countenance, as the emerald.'' <p>The complexion of the first might be clear as a bright day, though like that but of a short duration; see Sol 6:10; the next might have her name from the fragrancy and sweetness of her temper; and the third, as being so beautiful that she needed no paint to set her off, but was beauty and paint herself; or her beauty was as bright and dazzling as a precious stone; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>. Or these may respect their internal qualities, virtues, and graces; being children of the day, and not of the night; having a good name, which is better than all spices; and possessed of such graces as were comparable to jewels and precious stones. Though it might be, that Job, in giving them these names, may have respect to the change of his state and condition; his first daughter he called Jemima, or "day", because it was now day, with him: he had been in the night and darkness of adversity, temporal and spiritual, but now he enjoyed a day of prosperity, and of spiritual light and joy; the justness of his cause appeared, his righteousness was brought forth as the light, and his judgment as noonday; and the dispensations of divine Providence appeared to him in a different light than he had seen them in: his second daughter he called Kezia, or Cassia, an herb of a sweet smell, in opposition to the stench of his ulcers and of his breath, which had been so very offensive, and from which he was now free; and may denote also the recovery of his good name, better than precious ointment, in which cassia was an ingredient: his youngest daughter he called Kerenhappuch, the horn of paint, in opposition to his horn being defiled in the dust, and his face foul with weeping, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>; or if Kerenhappuch signifies the horn turned, as Peritsol interprets it, it may have respect to the strange and sudden turn of Job's affairs: and it is easy to observe, that men have given names to their children on account of their present state and condition, or on account of the change of a former one; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-51.htm">Genesis 41:51</a>. <p>(u) Hist.

But nkwn has not this signification anywhere: it signifies either directum  equals  rectum or erectum  equals  stabile, but not sincerum. However, objective truth and subjective truthfulness are here certainly blended in the notion "correct." The "correct" in Job's speeches consists of his having denied that affliction is always a punishment of sin, and in his holding fast the consciousness of his innocence, without suffering himself to be persuaded of the opposite. That denial was correct; and this truthfulness was more precious to God than the untruthfulness of the friends, who were zealous for the honour of God.<p>After Job has penitently acknowledged his error, God decides between him and the friends according to his previous supplicatory wish, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>. The heavenly Witness makes Himself heard on earth, and calls Job by the sweet name of &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;. And the servant of Jehovah is not only favoured himself, but he also becomes the instrument of grace to sinners. As where his faith shone forth he became the prophet of his own and the friends' future, so now he is the priestly mediator between the friends and God. The friends against whom God is angry, but yet not as against &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, but only as against those who have erred, must bring an offering as their atonement, in connection with which Job shall enter in with a priestly intercession for them, and only him (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, non alium sed  equals  non nisi), whom they regarded as one punished of God, will God accept (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-21.htm">Genesis 19:21</a>) - under what deep shame must it have opened their eyes!<p>Here also, as in the introduction of the book, it is the &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; which effects the atonement. It is the oldest and, according to its meaning, the most comprehensive of all the blood-offerings. Bullocks and rams are also the animals for the whole burnt-offerings of the Mosaic ritual; the proper animal for the sin-offering, however, is the he-goat together with the she-goat, which do not occur here, because the age and scene are strange to the Israelitish branching off of the &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514; from the &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;. The double seven gives the mark of the profoundest solemnity to the offering that was to be offered. The three also obey the divine direction; for although they have erred, God's will is above everything in their estimation, and they cheerfully subordinate themselves as friends to the friend.<p>(Note: Hence the Talmudic proverb (vid., Frst's Perlenschnre, S. 80): &#1488;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493; &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488; &#1499;&#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1489;, either a friend like Job's friends or death!) </body></html>
