Though he spoke to God in prayer, and entreated for some abatement of his sorrows, he got no relief; and though he spoke to himself in soliloquies, his sorrow was not repressed nor lessened; he could not administer comfort to himself in the present case, though he might to others in like circumstances, if his own were changed; <p>and though I forbear speaking, hold my peace, and say nothing, <p>what am I eased? or "what goes from me" (t)? not anything of my trouble or grief; sometimes a man speaking of his troubles to his friends gives vent to his grief, and he is somewhat eased; and on the other hand being silent about it, he forgets it, and it goes off; but in neither of those ways could Job be released: or it may be his sense is, that when he spake of his affliction, and attempted to vindicate his character, he was represented as an impatient and passionate man, if not as blasphemous, so that his grief was rather increased than assuaged; and if he was silent, that was interpreted a consciousness of his guilt; so that, let him take what course he would, it was much the same, he could get no ease nor comfort. <p>(t)   "quid a me abit", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Though I speak, my grief is <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> not asswaged: and <i>though</i> I forbear, what am I eased?</span><p>(f) If you would say, Why do you not then comfort yourself? he answers that the judgments of God are more heavy than he is able to assuage either by words or silence.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">my grief</span>] i. e. <span class="ital">my pain</span>; see on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-13.htm" title="So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great.">Job 2:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">what am I eased</span>] lit. as margin, <span class="ital">what</span> (of my pain or trouble) <span class="ital">goeth from me?</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6–17.

And now there seems to occur a pause, and the excited sufferer looks about him and realizes both the extremity of the evil in which he is held, and the new and unexpected trial, added to all others, of the judgment of men being against him. And he hardly knows whether he shall speak or be silent, so overcome is he and so unavailing to help him or make men judge truly of him are both speech and silence—<span class="ital">if I speak my grief is not assuaged, and if I forbear what am I eased? <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-6.htm" title="Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?">Job 16:6</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Yet this new condition in which he realizes that he is, which makes speech useless, forces him to speak, and he sets before himself in an excited soliloquy the combined enmity to him of men and God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>First, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/16-7.htm" title="But now he has made me weary: you have made desolate all my company....">Job 16:7-11</a></span>, he realizes to himself the complete estrangement from him of all familiar friends; God’s enmity to him has turned men also into foes (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/16-7.htm" title="But now he has made me weary: you have made desolate all my company....">Job 16:7-8</a></span>). This combined enmity of God and men is represented under what seems the figure of a creature hunted by one great lion-like assailant, leading on a host of minor, ignobler foes. The chief adversary is first described, his rending anger, and gnashing teeth, and flashing eyes (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm" title="He tears me in his wrath, who hates me: he gnashes on me with his teeth; my enemy sharpens his eyes on me.">Job 16:9</a></span>); and then the pell-mell rout of baser foes that howled behind him, their open mouth and shameless gestures, and full cry after the prey, which is flung over into their hands (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/16-10.htm" title="They have gaped on me with their mouth; they have smitten me on the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me....">Job 16:10-11</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Second, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/16-12.htm" title="I was at ease, but he has broken me asunder: he has also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark....">Job 16:12-17</a></span>, then the hostility of God Himself is particularly dwelt upon in graphic figures, which express its unexpected suddenness, its violence and destructiveness. One figure is that of a man suddenly grasped by another of overwhelming strength and tossed about and dashed to pieces (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-12.htm" title="I was at ease, but he has broken me asunder: he has also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.">Job 16:12</a></span>). Then the figure changes, and this shattered frame is set up as a mark, and God’s arrows hiss around him and split his reins and pour out his life to the ground (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm" title="His archers compass me round about, he splits my reins asunder, and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.">Job 16:13</a></span>). Again the figure changes, and this body seems some fair edifice or fort which God dismantles by breach upon breach till it lies a sorrowful ruin (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-14.htm" title="He breaks me with breach on breach, he runs on me like a giant.">Job 16:14</a></span>). And finally the condition of humiliation to which the sufferer is brought is described; and all this befell him though he had done no wrong (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/16-15.htm" title="I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust....">Job 16:15-17</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased!</span> As it is, nor speech nor silence are of any avail.

We have translated &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; by "evil" (Unheil), by which we have sought elsewhere to render &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, in order that we might preserve the same word in both members of the verse. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; (in form  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, in the Chethib &#1513;&#1493;&#1468;, the Aleph being cast away, like the Arabic su&#770;', wickedness, form the v. cavum hamzatum s-'a  equals  sawu'a) is waste and empty in mind, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>) waste and empty in fortune; or, to go further from the primary root, in the former case apparent goodness, in the latter apparent prosperity - delusion, and being undeceived "evil" in the sense of wickedness, and of calamity. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, which follows, refers to the exchange, or neutrally to the evil that is exchanged: the one or the other fulfils itself, i.e., either: is realized (passive of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-15.htm">1 Kings 8:15</a>), or: becomes complete, which means the measure of the punishment of his immorality becomes full, before his natural day, i.e., the day of death, is come (comp. for expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>). The translation: then it is over with him (Ges., Schlottm., and others), is contrary to the usage of the language; and that given by the Jewish expositors, &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; (abscinditur or conteritur), is a needlessly bold suggestion. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>. It is to be observed that &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; is Milel, and consequently 3 praet., not as in Sol 1:16 Milra, and consequently adj. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is not the branches generally (Luzzatto, with Raschi: branchage), but, as the proverbial expression for the high and low, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a> (vid., Dietrich, Abhandlung zur hebr. Gramm. S. 209), shows, the palm-branch bent downwards (comp. Targ. <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; signifies seats and walks covered with foliage). "His palm-branch does not become green, or does not remain green" (which Symm. well renders: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;), means that as he himself, the palm-trunk, so also his family, withers away. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-33.htm">Job 15:33</a> it is represented as &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;), wild grapes, or even unripe grapes of a vine, and as &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;, flowers of an olive.<p>(Note: In order to appreciate the point of the comparison, it is needful to know that the Syrian olive-tree bears fruit plentifully the first, third, and fifth years, but rests during the second, fourth, and sixth. It blossoms in these years also, but the blossoms fall off almost entirely without any berries being formed. The harvest of the olive is therefore in such years very scanty. With respect to the vine, every year an enormous quantity of grapes are used up before they are ripe. When the berries are only about the size of a pea, the acid from them is used in housekeeping, to prepare almost every kind of food. The people are exceedingly fond of things sour, a taste which is caused by the heat of the climate. During the months of June, July, and August, above six hundred horses and asses laden with unripe grapes come daily to the market in Damascus alone, and during this season no one uses vinegar; hence the word &#1489;&#1505;&#1512;&#1488; signifies in Syriac the acid (vinegar) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;. In Arabic the unripe grapes are exclusively called hhossrum (Arab. htsrm), or, with a dialectic distinction, hissrim. - Wetzst.)<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a> the godless man himself might be the subject: he casts down, like an olive-tree, his flowers, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a> this is inadmissible; if we interpret: "he shakes off (Targ. &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, excutiet), like a vine-stock, his young grapes," this (apart from the far-fetched meaning in &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;) is a figure that is untrue to nature, since the grapes sit firmer the more unripe they are; and if one takes the first meaning of &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, "he acts unjustly, as a vine, to his omphax" (e.g., Hupf.), whether it means that he does not let it ripen, or that he does not share with it any of the sweet sap, one has not only an indistinct figure, but also (since what God ordains for the godless is described as in operation) an awkward comparison. The subject of both verbs is therefore other than the vine and olive themselves. But why only an impersonal "one"? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a> &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1508;&#1497;&#1493; was referred to God, who is not expressly mentioned. God is also the subject here, and &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, which signifies to act with violence to one's self, is modified here to the sense of tearing away, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a> (which Aben-Ezra has compared), of tearing out; &#1499;&#1490;&#1508;&#1503;, &#1499;&#1494;&#1497;&#1514;, prop. as a vine-stock, as an olive-tree, is equivalent to even as such an one.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a> declares the lot of the family of the ungodly, which has been thus figuratively described, without figure: the congregation (i.e., here: family-circle) of the ungodly (&#1495;&#1504;&#1507; according to its etymon inclinans, propensus ad malum, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-16.htm">Job 13:16</a>) is (as it is expressed from the standpoint of the judgment that is executed) &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, a hard, lifeless, stony mass (in the substantival sense of the Arabic galmu&#770;d instead of the adject. &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>), i.e., stark dead (lxx &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; Aq., Symm., Theod., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and fire has devoured the tents of bribery (after Ralbag: those built by bribery; or even after the lxx: &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;). The ejaculatory conclusion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>, gives the briefest expression to that which has been already described. The figurative language, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>, is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm">Isaiah 59:4</a> (comp. supra, p. 257); in the latter passage similar vividly descriptive infinitives are found (Ges. 131, 4, b). They hatch the burdens or sorrow of others, and what comes from it is evil for themselves. What therefore their &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;, i.e., their inward part, with the intermingled feelings, thoughts, and strugglings (Olympiodorus: &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;), prepares or accomplishes (&#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-17.htm">Job 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a>), that on which it works, is &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, deceit, with which they deceive others, and before all, themselves (New Test. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;).<p>continued...</body></html>
