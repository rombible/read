What reason we have to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even good men, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under his affliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have sewed sackcloth - I have put on the badges of humiliation and grief; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>. This was the usual emblem of mourning. In order more deeply to express it, or to make it a "permanent" memorial of sorrow, it would seem that it was "sewed" around the body - as we "sew" crape on the hat.<p>And defiled my horn in the dust - The word rendered "defiled" (from &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;  &#8219;a&#770;lal) has, according to Gesenius, the notion of "repetition," derived from the use of the Arabic word. The Arabic means, to drink again, that is, after a former draught; and then, to drink deep. Hence, the word is applied to any action which is repeated - as to the second blow by which one already struck down is killed; to an after-harvest, or to gleaning in the fields. Here Gesenius supposes it means to "maltreat," to "abuse;" and the idea according to him is, that he had covered his whole head in the dust. The word "horn" is used in the Scriptures to denote strength and power. The figure is taken from horned animals, whose strength resides in their horns; and hence, as the horn is the means of defense, the word comes to denote that on which one relies; his strength, honor, dignity. A horn, made of "silver," was also worn as an ornament, or as an emblem, on the forehead of females or warriors.<p>It was probably used at first by warriors as a symbol of "power, authority," or "strength;" and the idea was undoubtedly derived from the fact that the strength of animals was seen to lie in the horn. Then it came to be a mere ornament, and as such is used still in the vicinity of Mount Lebanon. Oriental customs do not undergo those changes which are so common in the Western world, and it is possible that this custom prevailed in the time of Job. The "horn" was usually worn by females; it is also a part of the ornament on the head of a male, and as such would be regarded doubtless as an emblem of honor. The custom is prevalent at the present day among the Druses of Lebanon, the Egyptian cavalry, and in some parts of Russia bordering on Persia. Dr. Macmichael, in his "Journey," says: "One of the most extraordinary parts of the attire of their females (Drusus of Lebanon), is a silver horn, sometimes studded with jewels, worn on the head in various positions, "distinguishing their different conditions."<p>A married woman has it affixed to the right side of the head, a widow on the left, and a virgin is pointed out by its being placed on the very crown. Over this silver projection the long veil is thrown, with which they so completely conceal their faces to rarely have more than an eye visible." The horn worn by females is a conical tube, about twelve inches long. Col. Light mentions the horn of the wife of an emir, made of gold, and studded with precious stones. Horns are worn by Abyssinian chiefs in military reviews, or on parade after a victory. They are much shorter than those of the females, and are about the size and shape of a candle extinguisher, fastened by a strong fillet to the head, which is often made of metal; they are not easily broken off. This special kind of horn is undoubtedly the kind made by the false prophet Zedekiah for Ahab, to whom he said, when Ahab was about to attack the enemy, "With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou hast conquered them;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-10.htm">2 Chronicles 18:10</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>. The idea here is, that whatever once constituted the reliance or the glory of Job, was now completely prostrate. It was as if it were buried in the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. sewed&#8212;denoting the tight fit of the mourning garment; it was a sack with armholes closely sewed to the body.<p>horn&#8212;image from horned cattle, which when excited tear the earth with their horns. The horn was the emblem of power (1Ki 22:11). Here, it is<p>in the dust&#8212;which as applied to Job denotes his humiliation from former greatness. To throw one's self in the dust was a sign of mourning; this idea is here joined with that of excited despair, depicted by the fury of a horned beast. The Druses of Lebanon still wear horns as an ornament.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. I put on sackcloth sewed together, not upon my other garments, but next to my skin, as was done in great calamities; as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-30.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by on the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within on his flesh.">2 Kings 6:30</a></span>.

Another transition. Job turns to the consideration of how he has acted under his severe afflictions. In the first place, he has put on sackcloth, not for a time merely, as ordinary mourners do, but for a permanency, so that he may be said to have sewn it to his skin. There is, perhaps, also an allusion to the adhesion of the garment to his many sores. <span class="cmt_word">And have defiled my horn in the dust</span>. "My horn" is equivalent to "my pride," "my dignity." Job, when he left his state, and put on sackcloth, and "sat down among the ashes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>), denuded himself of his honour and dignity, and as it were trailed them in the dust <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The verb &#1511;&#1502;&#1496; (Aram. &#1511;&#1502;&#1496;), which occurs only once beside (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>), has, like Arab. qmt&#803; (in Gecatilia's transl.), the primary meaning of binding and grasping firmly (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, Symm. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, Targ. for &#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1498;, lengthened to a quadriliteral in Arab. qmt&#803;r, cogn. &#1511;&#1502;&#1509;),<p>(Note: On the other hand, &#1511;&#1496;&#1501;, Arab. qt&#803;m, abscindere, praemordere, has no connection with &#1511;&#1502;&#1496;, with which Kimchi and Reiske confuse it. This is readily seen from the opposite primary distinction of the two roots, &#1511;&#1501; and &#1511;&#1496;, of which the former expresses union, the latter separation.)<p>constringere, from which the significations comprehendere and corrugare have branched off; the signification, to wrinkle (make wrinkled), to shrivel up, is the most common, and the reference which follows, to his emaciation, and the lines which occur further on from the picture of one sick with elephantiasis, show that the poet here has this in his mind. Ewald's conjecture, which changes &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; into &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-2.htm">Job 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-13.htm">Job 30:13</a>  equals  &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, as subject to &#1493;&#1514;&#1511;&#1502;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497; (calamity seizes me as a witness), deprives the thought contained in &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, which renders the inferential clause &#1500;&#1506;&#1491; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; prominent, of much of its force and emphasis. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-8.htm">Job 16:8</a> this thought is continued: &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; signifies here, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm">Psalm 109:24</a> (which see), a wasting away; the verb-group &#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1499;&#1495;&#1491;, Arab. jh&#803;d, kh&#803;t, qh&#803;t&#803;, etc., has the primary meaning of taking away and decrease: he becomes thin from whom the fat begins to fail; to disown is equivalent to holding back recognition and admission; the metaphor, water that deceives  equals  dries up, is similar. His wasted, emaciated appearance, since God has thus shrivelled him up, came forth against him, told him to his face, i.e., accused him not merely behind his back, but boldly and directly, as a convicted criminal. God has changed himself in relation to him into an enraged enemy. Schlottm. wrongly translates: one tears and tortures me fiercely; Raschi erroneously understands Satan by &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;. In general, it is the wrath of God whence Job thinks his suffering proceeds. It was the wrath of God which tore him so (like <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>), and pursued him hostilely (as he says with the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-21.htm">Job 30:21</a>); God has gnashed against him with His teeth; God drew or sharpened (Aq., Symm., Theod., &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#1500;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>). His eyes or looks like swords (Targ. as a sharp knife, &#1488;&#1494;&#1502;&#1500;, &#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;) for him, i.e., to pierce him through. Observe the aorr. interchanging with perff. and imperff. He describes the final calamity which has made him such a piteous form with the mark of the criminal. His present suffering is only the continuation of the decree of wrath which is gone forth concerning him. </body></html>
