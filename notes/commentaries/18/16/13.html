What reason we have to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even good men, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under his affliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His archers - He does not come alone to shoot at me; he has employed a company of bowmen, who also direct "their" arrows against me. The word used here &#1512;&#1489;  rab means properly "much, large," great; and is applied to that which is powerful or mighty. It is nowhere else used in the sense of "archers," and might be rendered "his many;" that is, his bands, hosts, or armies. But as all the ancient versions render it "arrows," or "archers," probably that sense is to be retained. Allusion is here made to those who claimed to be the friends of Job, but who now showed to his apprehension that they were merely sharp-shooters under the control of God, to deepen his woes.<p>He cleaveth my reins asunder - With his arrows. They penetrate quite through me.<p>He poureth out my gall - The word "gall" means the "bile" - the yellowish green bitter fluid secreted in the liver. A similar figure occcurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>, "My liver is poured upon the earth." Among the pagan poets, also, the "liver" is represented as pierced, and as pouring out gore. Thus, Aesch. Agam. 442: &#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;  thinganei pros he&#772;par.

So in the Iliad, xiii. 412, xx. 469, 470. The meaning here is, "I am transfixed with a deadly wound, and must die.

Satan and his principalities and powers casting their fiery darts at him; or rather, his friends shooting their arrows, even bitter words, reproaches, and calumnies; or the various diseases of his body, his boils and ulcers, which were so many arrows shot into him, in every part of him all around, and gave him exquisite pain and anguish; besides the arrows of the Almighty, or that painful sensation he had of the wrath of God. This also is true of Christ, the antitype of Job and of Joseph; of the latter of which it is said, "the archers sorely grieved him, and shot at him, but his bow abode in strength", <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-23.htm">Genesis 49:23</a>; so Satan and his ministers threw their fiery darts at Christ when on the cross, and the scribes and priests, his emissaries, surrounded him there, and shot out their reproachful and blasphemous words at him, and the justice of God smote him, and the law of God cast its curses on him. Gussetius renders the words, "his great ones" (g); and such Job's friends were, men of great substance, and lived in great credit and honour; some have supposed them to be kings, and such were those that opposed Christ, and distressed him, the rulers of the people, civil and ecclesiastic: <p>he cleaveth my reins asunder; by causing his arrows to enter into them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-13.htm">Lamentations 3:13</a>; the consequence of which must be death; a man cannot live, at least long, after this is his case; though some think this is to be understood of the disorder of the stone in his reins or kidneys, which was very distressing to him: <p>and doth not spare; shows no mercy or pity, though in such sad circumstances and dreadful agonies; thus God spared not his own son, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; <p>he poureth out my gall upon the ground; which is done by piercing the gall bladder with the sword, or any such instrument, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-25.htm">Job 20:25</a>; which must issue in death; and the design of both these clauses is to show, that Job looked upon his case irretrievable, and he here makes use of hyperbolical expressions to set it forth by. <p>(g) "Ejus magnates", Comment.

These arrows fly about him and cleave his vital parts and pour out his life to the ground.

God is represented, not as himself the shooter of the arrows, but as surrounding Job with a body of archers, who are under his command and carry out his will. So, generally, Scripture represents the judgments of God as carried out by interior agents (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare</span>. The allusion is probably to Job's physical sufferings, which included severe pains in the lumbar region. He poureth out my gall upon the ground. The rupture of the gallbladder causes the contents to be sprit upon the ground. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  6  If I speak, my pain is not soothed;<p>And if I forbear, what alleviation do Iexperience?<p>  7  Nevertheless now hath He exhausted me;<p>Thou hast desolated all my household,<p>  8  And Thou filledst me with wrinkles - for a witness was it,<p>And my leanness rose up against me<p>Complaining to my face.<p>  9  His wrath tore me, and made war upon me;<p>He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth,<p>As mine enemy He sharpeneth His eyes against me.<p>&#1488;&#1501; stands with the cohortative in the hypothetical antecedent clause <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-6.htm">Job 16:6</a>, and in 6b the cohortative stands alone as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-16.htm">Psalm 73:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>, which is more usual, and more in accordance with the meaning which the cohortative has in itself, Ngelsbach, 89, 3. The interrogative, What goes from me? is equivalent to, what ( equals  nothing) of pain forsakes me. The subject of the assertion which follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-7.htm">Job 16:7</a>) is not the pain - Aben-Ezra thinks even that this is addressed in v. 7b - still less Eliphaz, whom some think, particularly on account of the sharp expressions which follow, must be understood, but God, whose wrath Job regards as the cause of his suffering, and feels as the most intolerable part of it. A strained connection is obtained by taking &#1488;&#1498; either in an affirmative sense (Ew.: surely), as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>, or in a restrictive sense: only ( equals  entirely) He has now exhausted me (Hirz., Hahn, also Schlottm.: only I feel myself oppressed, at least to express this), by which interpretation the &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, which stands between &#1488;&#1498; and the verb, is in the way. We render it therefore in the adversative signification: nevertheless (verum tamen) now he seeks neither by speaking to alleviate his pain, nor by silence to control himself; God has placed him in a condition in which all his strength is exhausted. He is absolutely incapable of offering any resistance to his pain, and care has also been taken that no solacing word shall come to him from any quarter: Thou hast made all my society desolate (Carey: all my clan); &#1506;&#1491;&#1492; of the household, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a>. Jerome: in nihilum redacti sunt omnes artus mei (&#1499;&#1500; &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, as explained by the Jewish expositors, e.g., Ralbag), as though the human organism could be called &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;. Hahn: Thou hast destroyed all my testimony, which must have been &#1488;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497; (from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, whereas &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, has a changeable Ssere). He means to say that he stands entirely alone, and neither sees nor hears anything consolatory, for he does not count his wife. He is therefore completely shut up to himself; God has shrivelled him up; and this suffering form to which God has reduced him, is become an evidence, i.e., for himself and for others, as the three friends, an accusation de facto, which puts him down as a sinner, although his self-consciousness testifies the opposite to him.</body></html>
