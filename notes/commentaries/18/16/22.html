It is strange to find Job speaking, in his condition, of <span class= "ital">years, </span>but so, for that matter, is it to find a man so sorely tormented as he was indulging in so long an argument. Perhaps this shows us that the narrative of Job is intended to be an ideal only, setting forth the low estate of sin-stricken humanity: this is only thrown out as a suggestion, no weight is assigned to it more than it may chance to claim. Perhaps, however, these words are spoken by Job in contemplation of his condition as a <span class= "ital">dying </span>man, even had he not been so afflicted.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-22.htm" title="When a few years are come, then I shall go the way from where I shall not return.">Job 16:22</a>. </span><span class="ital">When a few years are come — </span>The number of years which is determined and appointed to me; <span class="ital">then I shall go the way whence I shall not return — </span>Namely, to the state and place of the dead, whence men cannot return to this life. The meaning is, my death hastens, and therefore I earnestly desire that the cause depending between me and my friends may be determined, that if I be guilty of these things, I may bear the shame of it before all men; and, if I be innocent, that I may see my own integrity and the credit of religion (which suffers upon this occasion) vindicated, that so I may die in peace with God, and may leave the savour of a good name behind me. Observe, reader, to die is to go <span class="ital">the way whence we shall not return. </span>It is to go a journey, a long journey, a journey for good and all; to remove from this to another country, from the world of sense to the world of spirits! It is a journey to our long home; there will be no coming back to our state in this world, nor any change of our state in the other world. We must all of us very certainly, and very shortly, go this journey; and it is comfortable to those who keep a good conscience to think of it; for it is the crown of their integrity. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:17-22 Job's condition was very deplorable; but he had the testimony of his conscience for him, that he never allowed himself in any gross sin. No one was ever more ready to acknowledge sins of infirmity. Eliphaz had charged him with hypocrisy in religion, but he specifies prayer, the great act of religion, and professes that in this he was pure, though not from all infirmity. He had a God to go to, who he doubted not took full notice of all his sorrows. Those who pour out tears before God, though they cannot plead for themselves, by reason of their defects, have a Friend to plead for them, even the Son of man, and on him we must ground all our hopes of acceptance with God. To die, is to go the way whence we shall not return. We must all of us, very certainly, and very shortly, go this journey. Should not then the Saviour be precious to our souls? And ought we not to be ready to obey and to suffer for his sake? If our consciences are sprinkled with his atoning blood, and testify that we are not living in sin or hypocrisy, when we go the way whence we shall not return, it will be a release from prison, and an entrance into everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When a few years are come - Margin "years of number;" that is, numbered years, or a few years. The same idea is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>; see the notes at that place. The idea is, that he must soon die. He desired, therefore, before he went down to the grave, to carry his cause before God, and to have, as he did not doubt he should have, the divine attestation in his favor; compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a>. Now he was overwhelmed with calamities and reproaches, and was about to die in this condition. He did not wish to die thus. He wished that the reproaches might be wiped off, and that his character might be cleared up and made fair. He believed assuredly that if he could be permitted to carry his cause directly before God, he might be able to vindicate his character, and to obtain the divine verdict in his favor; and if he obtained that, he was not unwilling to die. It is the expression of such a wish as every man has, that his sun may not go down under a cloud; that whatever aspersions may rest on his character may be wiped away; and that his name, if remembered at all when he is dead, may go untarnished down to future times, and be such that his friends may repeat it without a blush. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. few&#8212;literally, "years of number," that is, few, opposed to numberless (Ge 34:30).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. To the state and place of the dead, whence men do not and cannot return to this life.

As the years of man's life are but few at most, and Job's years, which were yet to come, still fewer in his apprehension; or "years of number" (m), that are numbered by God, fixed and determined by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>; or being few are easily numbered: <p>then I shall go the way whence I shall not return; that is, go the way of all flesh, a long journey; death itself is meant, which is a going out of this world into another, from whence there is no return to this again, to the same place, condition, circumstances, estate, and employment as now; otherwise there will be a resurrection from the dead, the bodies will rise out of the earth, and souls will be brought again to be united with them, but not to be in the same situation here as now: this Job observes either as a kind of solace to him under all his afflictions on himself, and from his friends, that in a little time it would be all over with him; or as an argument to hasten the pleading of his cause, that his innocence might be cleared before he died; and if this was not done quickly, it would be too late. <p>(m)  "anni numeri", Montanus, Vatablus, Bolducius; "numbered days", Broughton; so Tigurine version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. It is doubtful whether Job means by “a few years” his whole life, or the years that are still to run of it. The last sense is fairest to the language. His disease though mortal was not immediately fatal; but at least his days were consumed “without hope.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">22–17:2</span>. What Job sought with tears was that God would cause his innocence to be acknowledged by God, and made manifest against men. Now he adds words in support of his prayer, or gives the reason for it. He so prays, for here in this life he has no hope of restoration. God’s anger will pursue him to the grave, which is already his portion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;16:22.&emsp;&emsp;For a few years shall come,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And I shall go the way whence I shall not return!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;17:1.&emsp;&emsp;My spirit is spent,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>My days are extinct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The grave is ready for me!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;17:2.&emsp;&emsp;Surely mockeries encompass me,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And mine eye must dwell on their provocation!<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When a few years are come</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a number of years</span>, which generally means a <span class="accented">small</span> number. <span class="cmt_word">I shall go the way whence I shall not return</span>.

Thus exceedingly miserable is his state and appearance, although he is no disguised hypocrite, who might need to do penance in sackcloth and ashes, and shed tears of penitence without any solace. Hirz. explains &#1506;&#1500; as a preposition: by the absence of evil in my hands; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-17.htm">Job 16:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-17.htm">Job 16:17</a> are substantival clauses, and &#1506;&#1500; is therefore just, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, a conjunction ( equals  &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;). His hands are clean from wrong-doing, free from violence and oppression; his prayer is pure, pura; as Merc. observes, ex puritate cordis et fidei. From the feeling of the strong contrast between his piety and his being stigmatized as an evil-doer by such terrible suffering, - from this extreme contrast which has risen now to its highest in his consciousness of patient endurance of suffering, the lofty thoughts of the next strophe take their rise. </body></html>
