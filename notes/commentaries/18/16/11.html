This seems best to suit both with the first clause of the next verse, which shows that Job speaks of his first afflictions which befell him when he was at ease, and with his principal design, which was to prove that both eminent prosperity and affliction did indifferently happen both to good and bad men, which indeed was evident from this example: because holy Job was ruined at the very time when this wicked people were most victorious and successful.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:6-16 Here is a doleful representation of Job's grievances. What reason we have to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even good men, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under his affliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God hath delivered me - Margin "shut me up."

The evil or wicked one, for it is in the singular number; and designs either Satan, into whose hands God had not only delivered his substance, but his person, excepting his life; though it may be, and which is an objection to this sense, Job as yet knew it not; or else Eliphaz, or, the singular number being put for the plural, as the next clause explains it, all his friends, whom he in turn calls evil and wicked men, because of their treatment of him; or else the Sabeans and Chaldeans are intended, who were suffered to plunder him of his substance; the words are very applicable to Christ, who was delivered to the Gentiles, and into the hands of sinners and wicked men, and that by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, who with wicked hands took him, and crucified him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>; or God "shut him up", or "delivered him bound" (d), as the word signifies; which was literally true of Christ, who was bound by the Jews, and delivered first to the high priest, and then to the Roman governor, in such circumstances, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-12.htm">John 18:12</a>; <p>and turned me over into the hands of the wicked; signifying the same as before, unless it should be rendered, "and caused me to decline", or "come down by the hands of the wicked" (e) that is, from his former state of prosperity and happiness, into the low circumstances in which he was, and which he was brought into by the means of wicked men, God suffering it so to be. <p>(d) "vinctum me tradidit", Grotius, Michaelis, Schultens.

All that Job had suffered at the hands of wicked men, the gibes of his "comforters," the insults and "derision ' of "base men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1, 8-10</a>), the desertion of many who might have been expected to have come to his aid, being by God's per-minion, is attributed by Job to God himself, who has "delivered" him up to these "ungodly" ones, and permits them to add to and intensify his sufferings. He was not so ruthlessly treated as his great Anti-type; he was not bound with thongs, or crowned with thorns, or smitten with a reed, or scourged, or crucified - even the smiting on the cheek, spoken of in ver. 10, was probably metaphorical; but he suffered, no doubt, grievously, through the scorn and contumely that assailed him, through his friends' unkindness, and his enimies'  insolent triumph, and the rude jeers of the "<span class="accented">abjeets</span>" who made him their "song" and their "byword" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And turned me over into the hands of the wicked</span>. Job speaks as if God had wholly given him up, made him over to the wicked, to deal with him exactly as they chose. This, of course, was not so. If the malevolence of Satan was limited by the Divine will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-6.htm">Job 2:6</a>); so, much more, would the malevolence of man be limited. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then began Job, and said:<p>  2  I have now heard such things in abundance,<p>Troublesome comforters are ye all!<p>  3  Are windy words now at an end,<p>Or what goadeth thee that thou answerest?<p>  4  I also would speak like you,<p>If only your soul were in my soul's stead.<p>I would weave words against you,<p>And shake my head at you;<p>  5  I would encourage you with my mouth,<p>And the solace of my lips should soothe you.<p>The speech of Eliphaz, as of the other two, is meant to be comforting. It is, however, primarily an accusation; it wounds instead of soothing. Of this kind of speech, says Job, one has now heard &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, much, i.e., (in a pregnant sense) amply sufficient, although the word might signify elliptically (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-28.htm">Nehemiah 9:28</a>) many times (Jer. frequenter); multa (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a>) is, however, equally suitable, and therefore is to be preferred as the more natural. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a> shows how &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is intended; they are altogether &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;, consolatores onerosi (Jer.), such as, instead of alleviating, only cause &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, molestiam (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a> Job returns their reproach of being windy, i.e., one without any purpose and substance, which they brought against him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>.: have windy words an end, or (&#1500;&#1493; vel   equals  &#1488;&#1501; in a disjunctive question, Ges. 155, 2, b) if not, what goads thee on to reply? &#1502;&#1512;&#1509; has been already discussed on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a>. The Targ. takes it in the sense of &#1502;&#1500;&#1509;: what makes it sweet to thee, etc.; the Jewish interpreters give it, without any proof, the signification, to be strong; the lxx transl. &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, which is not transparent. Hirz., Ew., Schlottm., and others, call in the help of the Arabic marida (Aramaic &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;), to be sick, the IV. form of which signifies "to make sick," not "to injure." <p>(Note: The primary meaning of Arabic marida (root mr, stringere) is maceratum esse, by pressing, rubbing, beating, to be tender, enervated (Germ. dialectic and popul. abmaracht); comp. the nearest related maratsa, then maraza, marasa, maraa, and further, the development of the meaning of morbus and &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; - originally and first, of bodily sickness, then also of diseased affections and conditions of spirit, as envy, hatred, malice, etc.; vid., Sur. 2, v. 9, and Beidhwi thereon. - Fl.)<p>We keep to the primary meaning, to pierce, penetrate; Hiph. to goad, bring out, lacessere: what incites thee, that (&#1499;&#1497; as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>, quod not quum) thou repliest again? The collective thought of what follows is not that he also, if they were in his place, could do as they have done; that he, however, would not so act (thus e.g., Blumenfeld: with reasons for comfort I would overwhelm you, and sympathizingly shake my head over you, etc.). This rendering is destroyed by the shaking of the head, which is never a gesture of pure compassion, but always of malignant joy, Sir. 12:18; or of mockery at another's fall, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>; and misfortune, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>. Hence Merc. considers the antithesis to begin with <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-5.htm">Job 16:5</a>, where, however, there is nothing to indicate it: minime id facerem, quin potius vos confirmarem ore meo - rather: that he also could display the same miserable consolation; he represents to them a change of their respective positions, in order that, as in a mirror, they may recognise the hatefulness of their conduct. The negative antecedent clause si essem (with &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, according to Ges. 155, 2, f) is surrounded by cohortatives, which (since the interrogative form of interpretation is inadmissible) signify not only loquerer, but loqui possem, or rather loqui vellem (comp. e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>, dare vellem). When he says: I would range together, etc. (Carey: I would combine), he gives them to understand that their speeches are more artificial than natural, more declamations than the outgushings of the heart; instead of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, it is &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, since the object of the action is thought is as the means, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a> &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, capite meo (for caput meum, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>), and &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-17.htm">Lamentations 1:17</a>, Ges. 138&#8224; ; Ew. takes &#1495;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; by comparison of the Arabic chbr, to know (the IV. form of which, achbara, however, signifies to cause to know, announce), in a sense that belongs neither to the Heb. nor to the Arab.: to affect wisdom. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-5.htm">Job 16:5</a> the chief stress is upon "with my mouth," without the heart being there, so also on the word "my lips," solace (&#1504;&#1497;&#1491; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., recalling <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>, &#1504;&#1497;&#1489; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, offspring or fruit of the lips) of my lips, i.e., dwelling only on the lips, and not coming from the heart. In ''&#1488;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1499;&#1501; (Piel, not Hiph.) the Ssere is shortened to Chirek (Ges. 60, rem. 4). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-6.htm">Job 16:6</a>, &#1499;&#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1501; is to be supplied to &#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;. He also could offer such superficial condolence without the sympathy which places itself in the condition and mood of the sufferer, and desires to afford that relief which it cannot. And yet how urgently did he need right and effectual consolation! He is not able to console himself, as the next strophe says: neither by words nor by silence is his pain assuaged. </body></html>
