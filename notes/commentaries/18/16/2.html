Those who pass censures, must expect to have them retorted; it is easy, it is endless, but what good does it do? Angry answers stir up men's passions, but never convince their judgments, nor set truth in a clear light. What Job says of his friends is true of all creatures, in comparison with God; one time or other we shall be made to see and own that miserable comforters are they all. When under convictions of sin, terrors of conscience, or the arrests of death, only the blessed Spirit can comfort effectually; all others, without him, do it miserably, and to no purpose.

As those Eliphaz has been discoursing of, concerning the punishment of wicked men; many instances of this kind had been reported to him from his preceptors, and from his parents, and which they had had from theirs, as well as Eliphaz had from his; and he had heard these things, or such like, told "many times" from one to another, as Ben Gersom interprets it; or "frequently", as the Vulgate Latin version, yea, he had heard them his friends say many things of this kind; so that there was nothing new delivered, nothing but what was "crambe millies cocta", the same thing over and over again; insomuch that it was not only needless and useless, but nauseous and disagreeable, and was far from carrying any conviction with it, or tracing weight and influence upon him; that he only gave it the hearing, and that was all, and scarce with any patience, it being altogether inapplicable to him: that wicked men were punished for their sins, he did not deny; and that good men were also afflicted, was a very plain case; and that neither good nor hatred, or an interest in the favour of God or not, were not known by these things; nor could any such conclusion be fairly drawn, that because Job was afflicted, that therefore he was a bad man: <p>miserable comforters are ye all; his friends came to comfort him, and no doubt were sincere in their intentions; they took methods, as they thought, proper to answer such an end; and were so sanguine as to think their consolations were the consolations of God, according to his will; and bore hard upon Job for seeming to slight them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-11.htm">Job 15:11</a>; to which Job here may have respect; but they were so far from administering divine consolation, that they were none at all, and worse than none; instead of yielding comfort, what they said added to his trouble and affliction; they were, as it may be rendered, "comforters of trouble", or "troublesome comforters" (k), which is what rhetoricians call an oxymoron; what they said, instead of relieving him, laid weights and heavy pressures upon him he could not bear; by suggesting his afflictions were for some enormous crime and secret sin that he lived in the commission of; and that he was no other than an hypocrite: and unless he repented and reformed, he could not expect it would be better with him; and this was the sentiment of them one and all: so to persons under a sense of sin, and distressed about the salvation of their souls, legal preachers are miserable comforters, who send them to a convicting, condemning, and cursing law, for relief; to their duties of obedience to it for peace, pardon, and acceptance with God; who decry the grace of God in man's salvation, and cry up the works of men; who lay aside the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, the consolation of Israel, and leave out the Spirit of God the Comforter in their discourses; and indeed all that can be said, or directed to, besides the consolation that springs from God by Christ, through the application of the Spirit, signifies nothing; for if any comfort could be had from any other, he would not be, as he is called, the God of all comfort; all the creatures and creature enjoyments, even the best are broken cisterns, and like the deceitful brooks Job compares his friends to, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>, that disappoint when any expectations of comfort are raised upon them. <p>(k)  "consolatores molestiae", Vatablus, Drusius, Mercerus, Cocceius, Schmidt, Michaelis; "molesti", Beza, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Codurcus, Tigurine version; "molestissimi", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>2. <span class="ital">many such things</span>] Job cannot help expressing his impatience of the sameness and the amount of his friends’ talk, and its uselessness or even worse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">miserable comforters</span>] The margin is, <span class="ital">troublesome comforters</span>, lit. comforters of trouble, whose comfort brings no ease but only more trouble.

We have translated &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; by "evil" (Unheil), by which we have sought elsewhere to render &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, in order that we might preserve the same word in both members of the verse. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; (in form  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, in the Chethib &#1513;&#1493;&#1468;, the Aleph being cast away, like the Arabic su&#770;', wickedness, form the v. cavum hamzatum s-'a  equals  sawu'a) is waste and empty in mind, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>) waste and empty in fortune; or, to go further from the primary root, in the former case apparent goodness, in the latter apparent prosperity - delusion, and being undeceived "evil" in the sense of wickedness, and of calamity. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, which follows, refers to the exchange, or neutrally to the evil that is exchanged: the one or the other fulfils itself, i.e., either: is realized (passive of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-15.htm">1 Kings 8:15</a>), or: becomes complete, which means the measure of the punishment of his immorality becomes full, before his natural day, i.e., the day of death, is come (comp. for expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>). The translation: then it is over with him (Ges., Schlottm., and others), is contrary to the usage of the language; and that given by the Jewish expositors, &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; (abscinditur or conteritur), is a needlessly bold suggestion. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>. It is to be observed that &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; is Milel, and consequently 3 praet., not as in Sol 1:16 Milra, and consequently adj. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is not the branches generally (Luzzatto, with Raschi: branchage), but, as the proverbial expression for the high and low, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a> (vid., Dietrich, Abhandlung zur hebr. Gramm. S. 209), shows, the palm-branch bent downwards (comp. Targ. <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; signifies seats and walks covered with foliage). "His palm-branch does not become green, or does not remain green" (which Symm. well renders: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;), means that as he himself, the palm-trunk, so also his family, withers away. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-33.htm">Job 15:33</a> it is represented as &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;), wild grapes, or even unripe grapes of a vine, and as &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;, flowers of an olive.<p>(Note: In order to appreciate the point of the comparison, it is needful to know that the Syrian olive-tree bears fruit plentifully the first, third, and fifth years, but rests during the second, fourth, and sixth. It blossoms in these years also, but the blossoms fall off almost entirely without any berries being formed. The harvest of the olive is therefore in such years very scanty. With respect to the vine, every year an enormous quantity of grapes are used up before they are ripe. When the berries are only about the size of a pea, the acid from them is used in housekeeping, to prepare almost every kind of food. The people are exceedingly fond of things sour, a taste which is caused by the heat of the climate. During the months of June, July, and August, above six hundred horses and asses laden with unripe grapes come daily to the market in Damascus alone, and during this season no one uses vinegar; hence the word &#1489;&#1505;&#1512;&#1488; signifies in Syriac the acid (vinegar) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;. In Arabic the unripe grapes are exclusively called hhossrum (Arab. htsrm), or, with a dialectic distinction, hissrim. - Wetzst.)<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a> the godless man himself might be the subject: he casts down, like an olive-tree, his flowers, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a> this is inadmissible; if we interpret: "he shakes off (Targ. &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, excutiet), like a vine-stock, his young grapes," this (apart from the far-fetched meaning in &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;) is a figure that is untrue to nature, since the grapes sit firmer the more unripe they are; and if one takes the first meaning of &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, "he acts unjustly, as a vine, to his omphax" (e.g., Hupf.), whether it means that he does not let it ripen, or that he does not share with it any of the sweet sap, one has not only an indistinct figure, but also (since what God ordains for the godless is described as in operation) an awkward comparison. The subject of both verbs is therefore other than the vine and olive themselves. But why only an impersonal "one"? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a> &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1508;&#1497;&#1493; was referred to God, who is not expressly mentioned. God is also the subject here, and &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, which signifies to act with violence to one's self, is modified here to the sense of tearing away, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a> (which Aben-Ezra has compared), of tearing out; &#1499;&#1490;&#1508;&#1503;, &#1499;&#1494;&#1497;&#1514;, prop. as a vine-stock, as an olive-tree, is equivalent to even as such an one.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a> declares the lot of the family of the ungodly, which has been thus figuratively described, without figure: the congregation (i.e., here: family-circle) of the ungodly (&#1495;&#1504;&#1507; according to its etymon inclinans, propensus ad malum, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-16.htm">Job 13:16</a>) is (as it is expressed from the standpoint of the judgment that is executed) &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, a hard, lifeless, stony mass (in the substantival sense of the Arabic galmu&#770;d instead of the adject. &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>), i.e., stark dead (lxx &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; Aq., Symm., Theod., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and fire has devoured the tents of bribery (after Ralbag: those built by bribery; or even after the lxx: &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;). The ejaculatory conclusion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>, gives the briefest expression to that which has been already described. The figurative language, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>, is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm">Isaiah 59:4</a> (comp. supra, p. 257); in the latter passage similar vividly descriptive infinitives are found (Ges. 131, 4, b). They hatch the burdens or sorrow of others, and what comes from it is evil for themselves. What therefore their &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;, i.e., their inward part, with the intermingled feelings, thoughts, and strugglings (Olympiodorus: &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;), prepares or accomplishes (&#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-17.htm">Job 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a>), that on which it works, is &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, deceit, with which they deceive others, and before all, themselves (New Test. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;).<p>continued...</body></html>
