It is natural to sufferers to think what they would do if the tables were turned; but, perhaps, our hearts may deceive us; we know not what we would do; we find it easier to discern the reasonableness and importance of a command, when we have occasion to claim the benefit of it, than when we have occasion to do the duty of it. We ought, however, to say and do all we can to strengthen our brethren in affliction, suggesting to them such considerations as are proper to encourage their confidence in God, and to support their sinking spirits. <span class="ital">Faith </span>and <span class="ital">patience, </span>we should remember, are the strength of the afflicted, and what helps these graces, confirms the feeble knees. The reader will observe, there is nothing in the Hebrew for the words <span class="ital">your grief, </span>in the latter clause of this verse, which are therefore printed in Italic letters. Our translators supposed that there is an <span class="ital">ellipsis </span>in the Hebrew text, and that these, or some words of the same import, were necessary to complete the sense. But the word, <span class="greekheb">ניד</span>, <span class="ital">nid, </span>here rendered <span class="ital">moving, </span>(being derived from <span class="greekheb">נוד</span>, <span class="ital">nud, </span>which sometimes means to condole,) may be translated, <span class="ital">compassion, </span>and then, without supposing any defect in the text, the sense of the clause will be, <span class="ital">Compassion should restrain, </span>or, <span class="ital">govern my lips; </span>namely, that they should avoid all speeches which might vex you, and speak only what might be to your <span class="ital">comfort </span>and benefit; whereas you let your tongues loose to speak whatsoever pleaseth you, although it does not profit, but only torment me. Chappelow proposes yet another version of the words, which he thinks the true one, namely, <span class="ital">I could be stronger than you with my mouth; but he </span>[<span class="ital">God</span>] <span class="ital">restrains the motion of my lips.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-5 Eliphaz had represented Job's discourses as unprofitable, and nothing to the purpose; Job here gives his the same character. Those who pass censures, must expect to have them retorted; it is easy, it is endless, but what good does it do? Angry answers stir up men's passions, but never convince their judgments, nor set truth in a clear light. What Job says of his friends is true of all creatures, in comparison with God; one time or other we shall be made to see and own that miserable comforters are they all. When under convictions of sin, terrors of conscience, or the arrests of death, only the blessed Spirit can comfort effectually; all others, without him, do it miserably, and to no purpose. Whatever our brethren's sorrows are, we ought by sympathy to make them our own; they may soon be so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>(But I would strengthen you with my mouth With that which proceeds from the mouth - words.<p>And the moving of my lips - My speaking - implying that it would have been done in a mild, gentle, kind manner - so that the lips would appear just to move.

Thus, Dr. Good renders it:<p>"With my own mouth will I overpower you,<p>Till the quivering of my lips shall fall."<p>But the common interpretation is to be preferred.

Comfort them with the words of his mouth; so God strengthens his people with strength in their souls, when he answers them with good and comfortable words; an angel strengthened Christ as man when in an agony, comforting him, suggesting comfortable things to him; so one saint may strengthen and comfort another when in distress, whether of soul or body; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-3.htm">Psalm 138:3</a>; and thus Job had strengthened and comforted others, with his words in former times, as Eliphaz himself owns, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-3.htm">Job 4:3</a> and so he would again, were there a change in his circumstances, and objects presented: <p>and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief: words uttered by him, which are done by the moving of the lips, should be such as would have a tendency to allay grief, to stop, restrain, forbid, and lessen sorrow; at least that it might not break out in an extravagant way, and exceed bounds, and that his friends might not be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>But</i> I would strengthen you <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage <i>your grief</i>.</span><p>(e) If this were in my power, yet I would comfort you and not do as you do to me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

We have translated &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; by "evil" (Unheil), by which we have sought elsewhere to render &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, in order that we might preserve the same word in both members of the verse.

The translation: then it is over with him (Ges., Schlottm., and others), is contrary to the usage of the language; and that given by the Jewish expositors, &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; (abscinditur or conteritur), is a needlessly bold suggestion. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>. It is to be observed that &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; is Milel, and consequently 3 praet., not as in Sol 1:16 Milra, and consequently adj. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is not the branches generally (Luzzatto, with Raschi: branchage), but, as the proverbial expression for the high and low, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a> (vid., Dietrich, Abhandlung zur hebr. Gramm. S. 209), shows, the palm-branch bent downwards (comp. Targ. <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; signifies seats and walks covered with foliage). "His palm-branch does not become green, or does not remain green" (which Symm. well renders: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;), means that as he himself, the palm-trunk, so also his family, withers away. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-33.htm">Job 15:33</a> it is represented as &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;), wild grapes, or even unripe grapes of a vine, and as &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;, flowers of an olive.<p>(Note: In order to appreciate the point of the comparison, it is needful to know that the Syrian olive-tree bears fruit plentifully the first, third, and fifth years, but rests during the second, fourth, and sixth. It blossoms in these years also, but the blossoms fall off almost entirely without any berries being formed. The harvest of the olive is therefore in such years very scanty. With respect to the vine, every year an enormous quantity of grapes are used up before they are ripe. When the berries are only about the size of a pea, the acid from them is used in housekeeping, to prepare almost every kind of food. The people are exceedingly fond of things sour, a taste which is caused by the heat of the climate. During the months of June, July, and August, above six hundred horses and asses laden with unripe grapes come daily to the market in Damascus alone, and during this season no one uses vinegar; hence the word &#1489;&#1505;&#1512;&#1488; signifies in Syriac the acid (vinegar) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;. In Arabic the unripe grapes are exclusively called hhossrum (Arab. htsrm), or, with a dialectic distinction, hissrim. - Wetzst.)<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a> the godless man himself might be the subject: he casts down, like an olive-tree, his flowers, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a> this is inadmissible; if we interpret: "he shakes off (Targ. &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, excutiet), like a vine-stock, his young grapes," this (apart from the far-fetched meaning in &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;) is a figure that is untrue to nature, since the grapes sit firmer the more unripe they are; and if one takes the first meaning of &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, "he acts unjustly, as a vine, to his omphax" (e.g., Hupf.), whether it means that he does not let it ripen, or that he does not share with it any of the sweet sap, one has not only an indistinct figure, but also (since what God ordains for the godless is described as in operation) an awkward comparison. The subject of both verbs is therefore other than the vine and olive themselves. But why only an impersonal "one"? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a> &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1508;&#1497;&#1493; was referred to God, who is not expressly mentioned. God is also the subject here, and &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, which signifies to act with violence to one's self, is modified here to the sense of tearing away, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a> (which Aben-Ezra has compared), of tearing out; &#1499;&#1490;&#1508;&#1503;, &#1499;&#1494;&#1497;&#1514;, prop. as a vine-stock, as an olive-tree, is equivalent to even as such an one.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a> declares the lot of the family of the ungodly, which has been thus figuratively described, without figure: the congregation (i.e., here: family-circle) of the ungodly (&#1495;&#1504;&#1507; according to its etymon inclinans, propensus ad malum, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-16.htm">Job 13:16</a>) is (as it is expressed from the standpoint of the judgment that is executed) &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, a hard, lifeless, stony mass (in the substantival sense of the Arabic galmu&#770;d instead of the adject. &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>), i.e., stark dead (lxx &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; Aq., Symm., Theod., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and fire has devoured the tents of bribery (after Ralbag: those built by bribery; or even after the lxx: &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;). The ejaculatory conclusion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>, gives the briefest expression to that which has been already described. The figurative language, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>, is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm">Isaiah 59:4</a> (comp. supra, p. 257); in the latter passage similar vividly descriptive infinitives are found (Ges. 131, 4, b).
