What reason we have to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even good men, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under his affliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He breaketh me - He crushes me.<p>With breach upon breach - He renews and repeats the attack, and thus completely overwhelms me. One blow follows another in such quick succession, that he does not give me time to recover.<p>He runneth upon me like a giant - With great and irresistible force - as some strong and mighty warrior whom his adversary cannot resist. The Hebrew is &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;  g&#305;&#770;bbo&#770;r - "a mighty one."

This is readily seen from the opposite primary distinction of the two roots, &#1511;&#1501; and &#1511;&#1496;, of which the former expresses union, the latter separation.)<p>constringere, from which the significations comprehendere and corrugare have branched off; the signification, to wrinkle (make wrinkled), to shrivel up, is the most common, and the reference which follows, to his emaciation, and the lines which occur further on from the picture of one sick with elephantiasis, show that the poet here has this in his mind. Ewald's conjecture, which changes &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; into &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-2.htm">Job 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-13.htm">Job 30:13</a>  equals  &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, as subject to &#1493;&#1514;&#1511;&#1502;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497; (calamity seizes me as a witness), deprives the thought contained in &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, which renders the inferential clause &#1500;&#1506;&#1491; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; prominent, of much of its force and emphasis. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-8.htm">Job 16:8</a> this thought is continued: &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; signifies here, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm">Psalm 109:24</a> (which see), a wasting away; the verb-group &#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1499;&#1495;&#1491;, Arab. jh&#803;d, kh&#803;t, qh&#803;t&#803;, etc., has the primary meaning of taking away and decrease: he becomes thin from whom the fat begins to fail; to disown is equivalent to holding back recognition and admission; the metaphor, water that deceives  equals  dries up, is similar. His wasted, emaciated appearance, since God has thus shrivelled him up, came forth against him, told him to his face, i.e., accused him not merely behind his back, but boldly and directly, as a convicted criminal. God has changed himself in relation to him into an enraged enemy. Schlottm. wrongly translates: one tears and tortures me fiercely; Raschi erroneously understands Satan by &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;. In general, it is the wrath of God whence Job thinks his suffering proceeds. It was the wrath of God which tore him so (like <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>), and pursued him hostilely (as he says with the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-21.htm">Job 30:21</a>); God has gnashed against him with His teeth; God drew or sharpened (Aq., Symm., Theod., &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#1500;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>). His eyes or looks like swords (Targ. as a sharp knife, &#1488;&#1494;&#1502;&#1500;, &#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;) for him, i.e., to pierce him through. Observe the aorr. interchanging with perff. and imperff. He describes the final calamity which has made him such a piteous form with the mark of the criminal. His present suffering is only the continuation of the decree of wrath which is gone forth concerning him. </body></html>
