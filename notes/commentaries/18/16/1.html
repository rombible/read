He ends by declaring that his case is desperate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-1.htm" title="Then Job answered and said,">Job 16:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Job answered and said — </span>“Job, above measure grieved that his friends should treat him in this cruel manner, expostulates very tenderly with them on the subject.

That he, as well as every one about him, was in the utmost astonishment, to find a man, whom he imagined his friend, accuse him falsely, and give him worse treatment than even his greatest enemies would have done. But that he plainly saw God was pleased to add this to the rest of his calamities; that he should not only be deprived of the comfort and assistance he might have expected from his friends, but that he should be used by them in a most relentless way, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/16-7.htm" title="But now he has made me weary: you have made desolate all my company....">Job 16:7-14</a>. That he had voluntarily taken on him all the marks of humility used by the guilty, though he was really innocent; that God above knew his innocence, though his friends so slanderously traduced him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/16-15.htm" title="I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust....">Job 16:15-22</a>.

That he made no doubt, whenever the cause came to a decision, the event would prove favourable to him. In the mean time, they would do well to consider what effect this their treatment of him must have on all mankind, and how great a discouragement it must be to the lovers of virtue, to see a man, whose character was yet unstained, on bare suspicion, dealt with so cruelly by persons pretending to virtue and goodness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/16-4.htm" title="I also could speak as you do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you....">Job 16:4-9</a>. Would they but give themselves time to reflect, they must see that he could have no motive to hypocrisy; since all his schemes and hopes, with regard to life, were at an end, and, as he expected nothing but death, with what view could he play the hypocrite?” <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm" title="They have gaped on me with their mouth; they have smitten me on the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.">Job 16:10</a>, to the end. — Heath.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-5 Eliphaz had represented Job's discourses as unprofitable, and nothing to the purpose; Job here gives his the same character. Those who pass censures, must expect to have them retorted; it is easy, it is endless, but what good does it do? Angry answers stir up men's passions, but never convince their judgments, nor set truth in a clear light. What Job says of his friends is true of all creatures, in comparison with God; one time or other we shall be made to see and own that miserable comforters are they all. When under convictions of sin, terrors of conscience, or the arrests of death, only the blessed Spirit can comfort effectually; all others, without him, do it miserably, and to no purpose. Whatever our brethren's sorrows are, we ought by sympathy to make them our own; they may soon be so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They conceive mischief - The meaning of this verse is, that they form and execute plans of evil. It is the characteristic of such men that they form such plans and live to execute them, and they must abide the consequences. All this was evidently meant for Job; and few things could be more trying to a man's patience than to sit and hear those ancient apothegms, designed to describe the wicked, applied so unfeelingly to himself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>SECOND SERIES.<p>Job 16:1-22.

There was nothing new in the second speech of Eliphaz, if we except its increased bitterness. Job had heard all the commonplaces about the universal sinfulness of man, and the invariable connection between sin and suffering, a thousand times before. It was the traditional belief in which he and all those about him had been brought up. But it brought him no relief. The reiteration of it only made him feel that there was neither comfort nor instruction to be got from his so-called "comforters."
