No one was ever more ready to acknowledge sins of infirmity. Eliphaz had charged him with hypocrisy in religion, but he specifies prayer, the great act of religion, and professes that in this he was pure, though not from all infirmity. He had a God to go to, who he doubted not took full notice of all his sorrows. Those who pour out tears before God, though they cannot plead for themselves, by reason of their defects, have a Friend to plead for them, even the Son of man, and on him we must ground all our hopes of acceptance with God. To die, is to go the way whence we shall not return. We must all of us, very certainly, and very shortly, go this journey. Should not then the Saviour be precious to our souls? And ought we not to be ready to obey and to suffer for his sake? If our consciences are sprinkled with his atoning blood, and testify that we are not living in sin or hypocrisy, when we go the way whence we shall not return, it will be a release from prison, and an entrance into everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My friends scorn me - Margin "are my scorners." That is, his friends had him in derision and mocked him, and he could only appeal with tears to God.<p>Mine eye poureth out tears unto God - Despised and mocked by his friends, he made his appeal to one who he knew would regard him with compassion. This shows that the heart of Job was substantially right. Notwithstanding, all his passionate exclamations; and notwithstanding, his expressions, when he was urged on by his sorrows to give vent to improper emotions in relation to God; yet he had a firm confidence in him, and always returned to right feelings and views. The heart may sometimes err. The best of people may sometimes give expression to improper feelings. But they will return to just views, and will ultimately evince unwavering confidence in God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

It is not to his "friends" or "companions," or "comforters," or any human aid, that Job turns in his distress. God alone is his Refuge. Forced by his woes to pass his time in weeping and mourning (see ver. 16), it is to God that his heart turns, to God that he "pours out his tears." Hardly as he thinks God to have used him, bitterly as he sometimes ventures to complain, yet the idea never crosses him of looking for help or sympathy to any other quarter, of having recourse to any other support or stay. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>), expresses the deepest feeling of his heart, the firmost principle of  his nature. Nothing overrides it. Even "out of the depths" his soul cries to the Lord (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-1.htm">Psalm 130:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  I was at ease, but He hath broken me in pieces;<p>And He hath taken me by the neck and shaken me to pieces,<p>And set me up for a mark for himself.<p>13  His arrows whistled about me;<p>He pierced my reins without sparing;<p>He poured out my gall upon the ground.<p>14  He brake through me breach upon breach,<p>He ran upon me like a mighty warrior.<p>He was prosperous and contented, when all at once God began to be enraged against him; the intensive form &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; (Arab. farfara) signifies to break up entirely, crush, crumble in pieces (Hithpo. to become fragile, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19</a>); the corresponding intensive form &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509; (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1509;, Arab. fd&#803;d&#803;, cogn. &#1504;&#1508;&#1509;), to beat in pieces (Polel of a hammer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>), to dash to pieces: taking him by the neck, God raised him on high in order to dash him to the ground with all His might. &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (from &#1504;&#1496;&#1512;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, like &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; from &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) is the target, as in the similar passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-12.htm">Lamentations 3:12</a>, distinct from &#1502;&#1508;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>, object of attack and point of attack: God has set me up for a target for himself, in order as it were to try what He and His arrows can do.

On all sides, whichever way he might turn himself, the arrows of God flew about him, mercilessly piercing his reins, so that his gall-bladder became empty (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>, and vid., Psychol. S. 268). It is difficult to conceive what is here said; <p>(Note: The emptying of the gall takes place if the gall-bladder or any of its ducts are torn; but how the gall itself (without assuming some morbid condition) can flow outwardly, even with a severe wound, is a difficult question, with which only those who have no appreciation of the standpoint of imagery and poetry will distress themselves. [On the "spilling of the gall" or "bursting of the gall-bladder" among the Arabs, as the working of violent and painful emotions, vid., Zeitschr. der deutschen morgenlnd. Gesellsch. Bd. xvi. S. 586, Z. 16ff. - Fl.])<p>it is, moreover, not meant to be understood strictly according to the sense: the divine arrows, which are only an image for divinely decreed sufferings, pressed into his inward parts, and wounded the noblest organs of his nature. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-14.htm">Job 16:14</a> follows another figure. He was as a wall which was again and again broken through by the missiles or battering-rams of God, and against which He ran after the manner of besiegers when storming. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; is the proper word for such breaches and holes in a wall generally; here it is connected as obj. with its own verb, according to Ges. 138, rem. 1. The second &#1508;&#1512;&#1509; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; with Kametz) has Ssade minusculum, for some reason unknown to us.<p>The next strophe says what change took place in his own conduct in consequence of this incomprehensible wrathful disposition of God which had vented itself on him. </body></html>
