No one was ever more ready to acknowledge sins of infirmity. Eliphaz had charged him with hypocrisy in religion, but he specifies prayer, the great act of religion, and professes that in this he was pure, though not from all infirmity. He had a God to go to, who he doubted not took full notice of all his sorrows. Those who pour out tears before God, though they cannot plead for themselves, by reason of their defects, have a Friend to plead for them, even the Son of man, and on him we must ground all our hopes of acceptance with God. To die, is to go the way whence we shall not return. We must all of us, very certainly, and very shortly, go this journey. Should not then the Saviour be precious to our souls? And ought we not to be ready to obey and to suffer for his sake? If our consciences are sprinkled with his atoning blood, and testify that we are not living in sin or hypocrisy, when we go the way whence we shall not return, it will be a release from prison, and an entrance into everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not for any injustice ... - Still claiming that he does not deserve his sorrows, and that these calamities had not come upon him on account of any enormous sins, as his friends believed.<p>My prayer is pure - My devotion; my worship of God is not hypocritical - as my friends maintain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. foul&#8212;rather, "is red," that is, flushed and heated [Umbreit and Noyes].<p>shadow of death&#8212;that is, darkening through many tears (La 5:17). Job here refers to Zophar's implied charge (Job 11:14). Nearly the same words occur as to Jesus Christ (Isa 53:9). So Job 16:10 above answers to the description of Jesus Christ (Ps 22:13; Isa 50:6, and Job 16:4 to Ps 22:7). He alone realized what Job aspired after, namely, outward righteousness of acts and inward purity of devotion.

Came all those afflictions and calamities upon him, which occasioned so much sorrow, weeping, mourning, and humiliation; he does not say there was no sin in him, not any in his heart, nor in his life, nor any iniquity done by him, he had acknowledged these things before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>; but that there was nothing in his hands gotten in an unjust manner; he had taken away no man's property, nor injured him in the least in a private way; nor had he perverted justice as a public magistrate, by taking bribes or accepting persons, and could challenge any to prove he had, as Samuel did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; <p>also my prayer is pure: he prayed, which disproves the calumny of Eliphaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-4.htm">Job 15:4</a>; and his prayer was pure too; not that it was free from failings and infirmities, which attend the best, but from hypocrisy and deceit; it came not out of feigned lips, but was put up in sincerity and truth; it sprang from an heart purified by the grace of God, and sprinkled from an evil conscience; it was put up in the faith of Christ, and as a pure offering through him; Job lifted up pure and holy hands, and with these a pure and holy heart, and for pure and holy things; so that it was not for want of doing justice to men, nor for want of devotion towards God, that be was thus afflicted by him; compare with this what is said of his antitype, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Not for <i>any</i> injustice in <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> mine hands: also my prayer <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> <i>is</i> pure.</span><p>(q) Signifying that he is not able to understand the cause of this his grievous punishment.<p>(r) That is, unfeigned and without hypocrisy.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Not for any injustice</span>] i. e. <span class="ital">though there is no wrong in my hands</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm" title="And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.">Isaiah 53:9</a>. The first clause denies that he had done anything amiss in action; and the second affirms that his “prayer,” i. e. his whole religious walk with God, was pure.

The perfects here also have not a present signification; he depicts his suffering according to the change it has wrought since it came upon him. The verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; is used with the instrumental Beth instead of with the acc., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a> (comp. on &#1489;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a>): they make an opening with their mouth (similar to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>, they make an opening with the lips, for diducunt labia).

The Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, which occurs only here, signifies not only to gather together a &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; in general, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>, but (after the Arab. tama&#770;la'a &#8219;ala, to conspire against any one)<p>(Note: Wetzstein thinks the signification conspirare for &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; poor in this connection, and prefers to translate: All together they eat themselves full upon me, &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; as reflexive of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-39.htm">Job 38:39</a>, synon. of &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;, as in "the Lovers of Amsi," Ferhht, after the death of his beloved, cries out: We are not separated!

One would, however, expect &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;; but perhaps we may refer to the interchange of &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1490; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-26.htm">Job 22:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-10.htm">Job 27:10</a>, with &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1490; &#1502;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-11.htm">Isaiah 66:11</a>.)<p>to complete one's self, to strengthen one's self (for a like hostile purpose): Reiske correctly: sibi invicem mutuam et auxiliatricem operam contra me simul omnes ferunt.<p>(Note: The signification to help, which belongs to the I. form Arab. mala'a, proceeds from mala&#770;'un, to have abundance, to be well off; prop. to be able to furnish any one with the means (opes, copias) for anything, and thereby to place him in a position to accomplish it.

Wau, whence the inf. &#8219;aul, &#8219;uwu&#770;l, and &#8219;ija&#770;le), it signifies boys, knaves; and it is as unnecessary to suppose two forms, &#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;, as two meanings, puer and pravus, since the language and particularly the book of Job has coined &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; for the latter signification: it signifies in all three passages (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-18.htm">Job 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-11.htm">Job 21:11</a>) boys, or the boyish, childish, knavish. The Arabic warratta leaves no doubt as to the derivation and meaning of &#1497;&#1512;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497;; it signifies to cast down to destruction (warttah, a precipice, ruin, danger), and so here the fut.
