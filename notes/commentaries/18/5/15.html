It is worthy of special note that the Lord is thus conceived of and represented, as the <span class= "ital">Saviour, </span>and the Saviour of them who have no saviour. Is not this an idea confined to the circle of the sacred writings? At all events, it so abounds and predominates in them as to be pre-eminently, if not exclusively, characteristic of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-15.htm" title="But he saves the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.">Job 5:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">But he saveth the poor, </span>&c. — According to the order in which the words stand in the Hebrew, the translation is, <span class="ital">But he saveth from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty, the poor. </span>Schultens thinks it should be interpreted, <span class="ital">from the sword which proceedeth out of their mouth, </span>meaning, their cutting and killing reproaches. A sense this which is approved by Buxtorf, and which receives no small confirmation from divers passages of Scripture, in which reproachful language is stigmatized by the name of a sword. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm" title="My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.">Psalm 57:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm" title="Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:">Psalm 64:3</a>. Dr. Waterland’s translation of the verse is to the same purpose. <span class="ital">But he saveth the poor from destruction by their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. </span>The general sense undoubtedly is, that God saveth such as, being poor, are defenceless, and therefore flee to him for refuge, from the censures, slanders, threatenings, and deceitful insinuations of their enemies; from the false swearing of witnesses, and the unrighteous sentences of corrupt judges, by which things their characters, or estates, or lives, may be exposed to great hazards.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-16 Eliphaz reminds Job, that no affliction comes by chance, nor is to be placed to second causes. The difference between prosperity and adversity is not so exactly observed, as that between day and night, summer and winter; but it is according to the will and counsel of God. We must not attribute our afflictions to fortune, for they are from God; nor our sins to fate, for they are from ourselves. Man is born in sin, and therefore born to trouble. There is nothing in this world we are born to, and can truly call our own, but sin and trouble. Actual transgressions are sparks that fly out of the furnace of original corruption. Such is the frailty of our bodies, and the vanity of all our enjoyments, that our troubles arise thence as the sparks fly upward; so many are they, and so fast does one follow another. Eliphaz reproves Job for not seeking God, instead of quarrelling with him. Is any afflicted? let him pray. It is heart's ease, a salve for every sore. Eliphaz speaks of rain, which we are apt to look upon as a little thing; but if we consider how it is produced, and what is produced by it, we shall see it to be a great work of power and goodness. Too often the great Author of all our comforts, and the manner in which they are conveyed to us, are not noticed, because they are received as things of course. In the ways of Providence, the experiences of some are encouragements to others, to hope the best in the worst of times; for it is the glory of God to send help to the helpless, and hope to the hopeless. And daring sinners are confounded, and forced to acknowledge the justice of God's proceedings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he saveth the poor from the sword - He shows himself to be the friend and protector of the defenseless. The phrase "from the sword, from their mouth," has been variously interpreted. Dr. Good renders it,<p>So he saveth the persecutors from their mouth,<p>And the helpless from the hand of the violent."<p>Noyes,<p>So he saveth the persecuted from their mouth,<p>The oppressed from the hand of the mighty."<p>This rendering is obtained by changing the points in the word &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;  me&#772;chereb, "from the sword," to &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;  ma&#772;che&#774;ra&#772;b, making it the Hophal participle from &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;  cha&#770;rab, to make desolate. This was proposed by Capellus, and has been adopted by Durell, Michaelis, Dathe, Doederlein, and others. Rosenmuller pronounces it wholly unauthorized. Jerome renders it, a gladio otis eorum - "from the sword of their mouth." It seems to me that the whole verse may be literally rendered, "he saveth from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the strong, the poor." According to this version, the phrase "from their mouth" may either mean from the mouth, i. e. the edge of the sword, using the plural for the singular, or from the mouth of oppressors, using it to represent their violence, and their disposition to devour the poor. The latter is more probably the true interpretation, and there is no need of a ehange in the points in the Hebrew. Thus, interpreted, the sense is, that God preserves the poor from oppression; or, in other words, that he befriends them, and is therefore worthy of confidence. This sentiment accords with what is found everywhere in the Bible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Who are so in a literal sense, and whom the Lord saves with a temporal salvation; these being the butt of the crafty, wise, and cunning, on whom their eyes are, for whom they lay snares, and lie in wait to draw them in; and these being helpless and without friends, God takes notice of them, appears for them, and arises for their help, and saves them: <p>from the sword; of their enemies, drawn against them and ready to be sheathed in them: <p>from their mouth; from their reproaches, calumnies, detraction, and evil speaking; or "from the sword, their mouth" (w), as some; or "from the sword of their mouth" (x), as others; or which comes out of it; whose mouths and tongues are as sharp swords, which destroy their credit and reputation, and threaten them with ruin; the Targum is,"from the slaughter of their mouth:" <p>and from the hand of the mighty; their mighty enemies, that, are mightier than they; the Targum is,"from the hand of a mighty king;''such an one as Pharaoh, which the same paraphrase makes mention of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-14.htm">Job 5:14</a>, and from whom the poor Israelites were delivered: this may be applied to the poor in a spiritual sense, who are poor in spirit, and are sensible of their spiritual poverty, whom the Lord looks unto, has a regard for, and saves them from "the sword" of avenging justice; that being awaked against the man, his fellow, and so warded off from them, and from the mouth of a cursing and condemning law, and from Satan the accuser of the brethren; and of wicked men, whose tongue rising up in judgment against them, he condemns; and from the "hand" of Satan the strong man armed, and who is stronger than they; and of all their spiritual enemies. <p>(w) So some in Michaelis.

The salvation of the poor is the consequence of defeating the devices of the crafty, as it is the object in view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from the sword, from their mouth</span>] It is evident that this verse wants the usual balance of clauses, and probably there is some corruption in it. Some mss omit <span class="ital">from</span> before mouth, “from the sword of their mouth.” The omission wants support, but the sense is probably that of the words as they stand: from the sword (which cometh) from their mouth; or the two expressions may be in apposition: <span class="ital">from the sword</span> even <span class="ital">from their mouth</span>. Others have proposed to point the word <span class="ital">from-the-sword</span> differently, making it to mean <span class="ital">the desolate</span>. This restores balance to the verse: thus he saveth the desolate from their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the mighty. The word “desolate” occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-12.htm" title="And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the middle of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.">Ezekiel 29:12</a>, said of cities, and the verb is often applied to lands, mountains, &c., but does not seem used of persons.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he sayeth the poor from the sword, from their mouth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">from the sword of their mouth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from their cruel and destructive words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a>), which cut "like a sharp razor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-2.htm">Psalm 52:2</a>).
