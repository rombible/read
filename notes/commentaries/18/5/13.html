For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.">1Corinthians 3:19</a>): “The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.” The word rendered “froward” means <span class= "ital">crooked, perverse, </span>or <span class= "ital">tortuous. </span>The name Naphtali is derived from the same root (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-8.htm" title="And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.">Genesis 30:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/5-13.htm" title="He takes the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the fraudulent is carried headlong....">Job 5:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness — </span>Men wise to do evil, or wise in the opinion of the world; he not only deceives their hopes and counsels, but turns those counsels against themselves. <span class="ital">And the counsel of the froward — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">Of the perverse, </span>or <span class="ital">wrestlers, </span>such as <span class="ital">wind </span>and <span class="ital">turn </span>every way, as wrestlers do, and will leave no means untried to accomplish their designs: <span class="ital">is carried headlong — </span>That is, tumbled down and broken, and that by their own precipitation and haste. Such is their malice, that they cannot proceed leisurely and wisely, but are eager, and venturous, and rash, and so make more haste than good speed in their wicked designs: or, the meaning may be, The event will show that such deceitful cunning, though never so coolly and sedately digested, will deserve no better name than precipitate rashness and infatuation. <span class="ital">They meet with darkness in the day-time — </span>In plain things they run into gross mistakes, and choose those courses which are worst for themselves. <span class="ital">Darkness </span>often denotes misery, but here ignorance or error. <span class="ital">And grope in the noon-day — </span>Like blind men to find their way, not knowing what to do.

The difference between prosperity and adversity is not so exactly observed, as that between day and night, summer and winter; but it is according to the will and counsel of God. We must not attribute our afflictions to fortune, for they are from God; nor our sins to fate, for they are from ourselves. Man is born in sin, and therefore born to trouble. There is nothing in this world we are born to, and can truly call our own, but sin and trouble. Actual transgressions are sparks that fly out of the furnace of original corruption. Such is the frailty of our bodies, and the vanity of all our enjoyments, that our troubles arise thence as the sparks fly upward; so many are they, and so fast does one follow another. Eliphaz reproves Job for not seeking God, instead of quarrelling with him. Is any afflicted? let him pray. It is heart's ease, a salve for every sore. Eliphaz speaks of rain, which we are apt to look upon as a little thing; but if we consider how it is produced, and what is produced by it, we shall see it to be a great work of power and goodness. Too often the great Author of all our comforts, and the manner in which they are conveyed to us, are not noticed, because they are received as things of course. In the ways of Providence, the experiences of some are encouragements to others, to hope the best in the worst of times; for it is the glory of God to send help to the helpless, and hope to the hopeless. And daring sinners are confounded, and forced to acknowledge the justice of God's proceedings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness - This passage is quoted by the apostle Paul in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>, with the usual formula in referring to the Old Testament, &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;  gegraptai gar, "for it is written," showing that he regarded it as a part of the inspired oracles of God. The word "wise" here undoubtedly means the cunning, the astute, the crafty, and the designing. It cannot mean those who are truly wise in the Scripture sense; but the meaning is, that those who form plans which they expect to accomplish by cunning and craft, are often the victims of their own designs. The same sentiment not unfrequently occurs in the Scriptures and elsewhere, and has all the aspect of being a proverb. Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a> :<p>He made a pit and digged it,<p>And is fallen into the ditch which he made."<p>So <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a> :<p>The pagan are sunk down into the pit that they made;<p>In the net which they hid is their own foot taken."<p>So <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a> :<p>Let his net that he hath bid catch himself<p>Into that very destruction let him fall."<p>So <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-15.htm">Psalm 37:15</a> :<p>Their sword shall enter into their own heart,<p>And their bow shall be broken."<p>Compare Eurip.

Paul (1Co 3:19) quoted this clause with the formula establishing its inspiration, "it is written." He cites the exact Hebrew words, not as he usually does the Septuagint, Greek version (Ps 9:15). Haman was hanged on the gallows he prepared for Mordecai (Es 5:14; 7:10).<p>the wise&#8212;that is, "the cunning."<p>is carried headlong&#8212;Their scheme is precipitated before it is ripe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The wise in their own craftiness; </span> wicked men, who are wise to do evil, and wise in the opinion of the world, he not only deceiveth in their hopes and counsels, but turns them against themselves; as we see in Ahithophel, Haman, &c. <span class="ital">The froward</span>, or <span class="ital">perverse</span>, or <span class="ital">wrestlers</span>; such as wind and turn every way, as wrestlers do, and will leave no means untried to accomplish their counsels. <span class="ital">Is carried headlong</span>, i.e. is tumbled down and broken, and that by their own precipitation and haste.

As beasts are taken in a pit, or birds in a snare or net, or with birdlime; so these crafty men, who are wise in their own opinion, and really so in things natural, civil, and worldly, or however, to do evil are entangled and taken in their own schemes; they fall into the pit they have digged for others, and are snared in the works of their own hands, as Haman and his sons were hanged on the gallows he prepared for Mordecai, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>; or, "by their own craftiness" (q), by the crafty schemes they themselves have formed: so sometimes those very things crafty men design to prevent, are brought about by the very means they make use of; thus Joseph's brethren designed to prevent the accomplishment of his dreams, which portended their subjection to him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-9.htm">Genesis 37:9</a>, by selling him to the Ishmaelites, who carried him to Egypt, where, in process of time, he was made governor of the land, and where his brethren became obedient to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>; with which fact Eliphaz might be acquainted, it being not long before his time: so the Jews, to prevent the Romans taking away their city and nation, contrived to put Christ to death, and did, whereby they brought the wrath of God upon them, executed by those very persons; the same they did also, to prevent the spread of his fame and glory in the world, and that he might not be believed on as the Saviour of men, whereas, hereby he became the Saviour of them; and he a crucified Christ, being preached to the world by his ministers, the savour of his knowledge has been diffused in every place, his glory great in all the earth, and will be more so: the Targum applies this to the wise men of Pharaoh, and the Apostle Paul to the Jewish doctors and wise philosophers of the Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>; which quotation proves the authority of this book: <p>and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong: that is, the counsel or well contrived schemes of the crafty and wise before mentioned, who twist and wind about, as the word (r) here used signifies, that there is no tracing their measures, and finding out the spring of them, nor the ends they have in view; yet these are sometimes carried on to execution in a rash and precipitate manner, and so miscarry; and like a man that is had to a precipice, and is thrown down from thence, and is destroyed at once, so are their counsels and schemes dashed to pieces by the providence of God: or, "is hastened" (s); too much haste is made to accomplish it, and so it comes to nought, through an over eagerness to have it done at once; not waiting a fit opportunity for the accomplishment of it. <p>(q) "per suam ipsorum astutiam", Schultens.
