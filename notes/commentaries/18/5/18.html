And he never makes a wound too great, too deep, for himself to cure. <span class="ital">He will deliver thee — </span>If thou seek to him by prayer and repentance; <span class="ital">in six troubles — </span>In distresses, manifold and repeated.

Call it a chastening, which comes from the Father's love, and is for the child's good; and notice it as a messenger from Heaven. Eliphaz also encourages Job to submit to his condition. A good man is happy though he be afflicted, for he has not lost his enjoyment of God, nor his title to heaven; nay, he is happy because he is afflicted. Correction mortifies his corruptions, weans his heart from the world, draws him nearer to God, brings him to his Bible, brings him to his knees. Though God wounds, yet he supports his people under afflictions, and in due time delivers them. Making a wound is sometimes part of a cure. Eliphaz gives Job precious promises of what God would do for him, if he humbled himself. Whatever troubles good men may be in, they shall do them no real harm. Being kept from sin, they are kept from the evil of trouble. And if the servants of Christ are not delivered from outward troubles, they are delivered by them, and while overcome by one trouble, they conquer all. Whatever is maliciously said against them shall not hurt them. They shall have wisdom and grace to manage their concerns. The greatest blessing, both in our employments and in our enjoyments, is to be kept from sin. They shall finish their course with joy and honour. That man lives long enough who has done his work, and is fit for another world. It is a mercy to die seasonably, as the corn is cut and housed when fully ripe; not till then, but then not suffered to stand any longer. Our times are in God's hands; it is well they are so. Believers are not to expect great wealth, long life, or to be free from trials. But all will be ordered for the best. And remark from Job's history, that steadiness of mind and heart under trial, is one of the highest attainments of faith. There is little exercise for faith when all things go well. But if God raises a storm, permits the enemy to send wave after wave, and seemingly stands aloof from our prayers, then, still to hang on and trust God, when we cannot trace him, this is the patience of the saints. Blessed Saviour! how sweet it is to look unto thee, the Author and Finisher of faith, in such moments!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he maketh sore - That is, he afflicts.<p>And bindeth up - He heals. The phrase is taken from the custom of binding up a wound; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-21.htm">Isaiah 38:21</a>, note. This was a common mode of healing among the Hebrews; and the practice of medicine appears to have been confined much to external applications. The meaning of this verse is, that afflictions come from God, and that he only can support, comfort, and restore. Health is his gift; and all the consolation which we need, and for which we can look, must come from him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. he maketh sore, and bindeth up&#8212;(De 32:39; Ho 6:1; 1Sa 2:6).

Or, "though he maketh sore, yet he bindeth up" (d); as a surgeon, who makes a wound the sorer by probing and opening it, to let out the matter and make way for his medicine, and then lays on the plaster, and binds it up: so God causes grief and puts his people to pain, by diseases of body, or by making breaches in, their families and estates, and such like cutting providences; and then he binds up their breach, and heals the stroke of their wound, and in the issue makes all whole again: so in spiritual things; he cuts and wounds, and gives pain and uneasiness, by the sharp twoedged sword of the word, and by his Spirit making use of it; and lays open all the corruption of nature, and brings to repentance and humiliation for all transgressions; and then pours in the oil and wine of pardoning grace and mercy, and binds up the wounds that are made: <p>he woundeth, and his hands make whole; or "heal" (e); the same thing is meant, expressed by different words; and the whole suggests, that every afflicted man, and particularly Job, should he behave well, and as he ought, under the afflicting hand of God, would be healed, and become sound and whole again, in body, mind, family, and estate; for, though God for the present caused grief, yet he would have compassion, since he did not willingly grieve the children of men; did not do it for his own pleasure, but for their good; as a skilful surgeon cuts and wounds in order to heal; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>. <p>(d) Assembly's Annotations.

The noun &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, coined by the Chokma, and out of Job and Proverbs found only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>, and even there in gnomical connection, is formed from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, essentia, and signifies as it were essentialitas, realitas: it denotes, in relation to all visible things, the truly existing, the real, the objective; true wisdom (i.e., knowledge resting on an objective actual basis), true prosperity, real profiting and accomplishing. It is meant that they accomplish nothing that has actual duration and advantage. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a> cannot be better translated than by Paul, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>, who here deviates from the lxx. With &#1504;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, God's seizure, which prevents the contemplated achievement, is to be thought of. He pours forth over the worldly wise what the prophets call the spirit of deep sleep (&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;) and of dizziness (&#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;).

Bttch. translates: without sword, i.e., instrument of power (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>); but &#1502;&#1503; with &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; leads one to expect that that from which one is rescued is to be described (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-20.htm">Job 5:20</a>). Ewald corrects &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, which Olsh. thinks acute: it is, however, unhebraic, according to our present knowledge of the usage of the language; for the passives of &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; are used of cities, countries, and peoples, but not of individual men. Olsh., in his hesitancy, arrives at no opinion. But the text is sound and beautiful. &#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; with pathetic unaccented ah (Ges. 80, rem. 2, f), from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-16.htm">Psalm 92:16</a> Chethib. </body></html>
