There is secret unsoundness there which is the cause of the manifest and open misery. It is impossible that a man so stricken should be otherwise than, for some unknown reason, the guilty victim of the righteous wrath of a just judge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-3.htm" title="I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.">Job 5:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">I have seen the foolish taking root — </span>I have observed the wicked man, whom I term foolish, as being destitute of true, that is, of heavenly, wisdom, not only prosperous for the present, but, as it seemed, firm and secure for the future, being strongly fortified with power and riches, and children too, so that there was no likelihood or apparent danger of a change; <span class="ital">but suddenly — </span>In a moment, before any one’s expectation; <span class="ital">I cursed his habitation — </span>I saw, by the event which followed his prosperity, that he was a man under a divine curse, and that, notwithstanding the seeming depth and strength in which he vainly promised himself a permanent, unshaken situation for many years, all his hopes were built on a weak and false foundation. Thus Eliphaz answers an objection concerning the present seeming prosperity of the wicked, which he confesses that he himself had sometimes observed, but which, he insists, was of short duration, destructive judgments from God unexpectedly overwhelming them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 Eliphaz here calls upon Job to answer his arguments. Were any of the saints or servants of God visited with such Divine judgments as Job, or did they ever behave like him under their sufferings? The term, saints, holy, or more strictly, consecrated ones, seems in all ages to have been applied to the people of God, through the Sacrifice slain in the covenant of their reconciliation. Eliphaz doubts not that the sin of sinners directly tends to their ruin. They kill themselves by some lust or other; therefore, no doubt, Job has done some foolish thing, by which he has brought himself into this condition. The allusion was plain to Job's former prosperity; but there was no evidence of Job's wickedness, and the application to him was unfair and severe.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have seen the foolish - The wicked. To confirm the sentiment which he had just advanced, Eliphaz appeals to his own observation, and says that though the wicked for a time seem to be prosperous, yet he had observed that they were soon overtaken with calamity and cut down. He evidently means that prosperity was no evidence of the divine favor; but that when it had continued for a little time, and was then withdrawn, it was proof that the man who had been prospered was at heart a wicked man. It was easy to understated that he meant that this should be applied to Job, who, though he had been favored with temporary prosperity, was now revealed to be at heart a wicked man. The sentiment here advanced by Eliphaz, as the result of his observation, strikingly accords with the observation of David, as expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-6</a> :<p>"I have seen the wicked in great power,<p>And spreading himself like a green bay-tree;<p>Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not:<p>Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found."<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-6</a> :35-36.<p>Taking root - This figure, to denote prosperous and rapid growth, is often used in the Scriptures.

I have seen the sinner spread his "root" wide in prosperity, yet circumstances "suddenly" occurred which gave occasion for his once prosperous dwelling being "cursed" as desolate (Ps 37:35, 36; Jer 17:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I have oft observed it in my experience. Having severely rebuked Job for his transports of passion and intemperate speeches against God, he now returns to his former argument, and proves that such dreadful and destructive judgments of God do not befall the righteous, but the wicked, as he observed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-7.htm" title="Remember, I pray you, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?">Job 4:7</a>,8</span>.

Such foolish wicked men as before described; those Eliphaz had observed to prosper in the world, and increase in riches, and even to have attained to a seeming stability and firmness, as if they would ever continue in such happy circumstances, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a>; by this he would obviate an objection that here might be raised and made against the assertion he was proving, that wicked men are afflicted and punished of God for their sins; whereas it is notorious that they are not in trouble as other men, but in very prosperous and flourishing circumstances; this he grants is their case for a while, as he had observed, but in a short time they pass away, they and their substance disappear, and are no more seen, as follows: <p>but suddenly I cursed his habitation; not that he wished ill to him, or imprecated evils upon him; for cursing and bitterness only fit the mouths of wicked men, and not good men, among whom Eliphaz must be allowed to be; but he immediately thought within himself, as soon as he saw the flourishing state of the wicked, that the curse of the Lord was in their houses, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-33.htm">Proverbs 3:33</a>; that they and all they had were under a curse, and that God find given them what they had with a curse, and had cursed all their blessings; which makes the difference between a good man and a wicked man; the one has what he has, his cottage and his small substance, with a blessing; the other his pleasant habitation, as the word (r) here used signifies, his stately palace, rich furniture, and large estates, with a curse; or he prognosticated, he foresaw, and could foretell, and that without pretending to an extraordinary spirit of prophecy, that in a short time the curse of God would light upon him, and upon his house, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>. <p>(r) "pulchritudini ejus", V.

It might seem to prosper: the foolish man might seem to be taking root; but Eliphaz was not deceived by appearances - he saw through them, he knew that there was a curse upon the man's house, and so pronounced it accursed. And the ruin which he had foreseen, it is implied, followed. But suddenly; rather, <span class="accented">immediately</span>, <span class="accented">without hesitation.</span> I cursed his habitation; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pronounced it accursed, declared that the curse of God rested upon it?" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17  Is a mortal just before Eloah,<p>Or a man pure before his Maker?<p>18  Behold, He trusteth not His servants!<p>And His angels He chargeth with imperfection.<p>19  How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,<p>They are crushed as though they were moths.<p>20  From morning until evening, - so are they broken in pieces:<p>Unobserved they perish for ever.<p>21  Is it not so: the cord of their tent in them is torn away,<p>So they die, and not in wisdom?<p>The question arises whether &#1502;&#1503; is comparative: prae Deo, on which Mercier with penetration remarks: justior sit oportet qui immerito affligitur quam qui immerito affligit; or causal: a Deo, h.e., ita ut a Deo justificetur. All modern expositors rightly decide on the latter. Hahn justly maintains that &#1506;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; are found in a similar connection in other places; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a> is perhaps not to be explained in any other way, at least that does not restrict the present passage. By the servants of God, none but the angels, mentioned in the following line of the verse, are intended. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1489;&#1468; signifies imputare (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-15.htm">1 Samuel 22:15</a>); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a>) we read &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, absurditatem (which Hupf. wishes to restore even here), joined with the verb in this signification. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; is certainly not to be taken as stultitia from the verb &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;; the half vowel, and still less the absence of the Dagesh, will not allow this. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1503; (Olsh. 213, c), itself uncertain in its etymology, presents no available analogy. The form points to a Lamedh-He verb, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; from &#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, so perhaps from &#1492;&#1500;&#1492;, Niph. &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, remotus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a> : being distant, being behind the perfect, difference; or even from &#1492;&#1500;&#1492; (Targ. &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, Pa. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;)  equals  &#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, weakness, want of strength.<p>(Note: Schnurrer compares the Arabic wahila, which signifies to be relaxed, forgetful, to err, to neglect. Ewald, considering the &#1514; as radical, compares the Arabic dll, to err, and ta&#770;l, med. wau, to be dizzy, unconscious; but neither from &#1493;&#1492;&#1500; nor from &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; can the substantival form be sustained.)<p>Both significations will do, for it is not meant that the good spirits positively sin, as if sin were a natural necessary consequence of their creatureship and finite existence, but that even the holiness of the good spirits is never equal to the absolute holiness of God, and that this deficiency is still greater in spirit-corporeal man, who has earthiness as the basis of his original nature. At the same time, it is presupposed that the distance between God and created earth is disproportionately greater than between God and created spirit, since matter is destined to be exalted to the nature of the spirit, but also brings the spirit into the danger of being degraded to its own level.</body></html>
