The difference between prosperity and adversity is not so exactly observed, as that between day and night, summer and winter; but it is according to the will and counsel of God. We must not attribute our afflictions to fortune, for they are from God; nor our sins to fate, for they are from ourselves. Man is born in sin, and therefore born to trouble. There is nothing in this world we are born to, and can truly call our own, but sin and trouble. Actual transgressions are sparks that fly out of the furnace of original corruption. Such is the frailty of our bodies, and the vanity of all our enjoyments, that our troubles arise thence as the sparks fly upward; so many are they, and so fast does one follow another. Eliphaz reproves Job for not seeking God, instead of quarrelling with him. Is any afflicted? let him pray. It is heart's ease, a salve for every sore. Eliphaz speaks of rain, which we are apt to look upon as a little thing; but if we consider how it is produced, and what is produced by it, we shall see it to be a great work of power and goodness. Too often the great Author of all our comforts, and the manner in which they are conveyed to us, are not noticed, because they are received as things of course. In the ways of Providence, the experiences of some are encouragements to others, to hope the best in the worst of times; for it is the glory of God to send help to the helpless, and hope to the hopeless. And daring sinners are confounded, and forced to acknowledge the justice of God's proceedings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who giveth rain upon the earth - In the previous verse, Eliphaz had said, in general, that God did wonderful things - things which are fitted to lead us to put our trust in him. In this and the succeeding verses, he descends to particulars, and specifies those things which show that God is worthy to be confided in. This enunciation continues to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-16.htm">Job 5:16</a>, and the general scope is, that the agency of God is seen everywhere; and that his providential dealings are adapted to impress man with elevated ideas of his justice and goodness. Eliphaz begins with the rain, and says that the fact that God sends it upon the earth was fitted to lead man to confide in him. He means, that while the sun, and moon, and seasons have stated times, and are governed by settled laws, the rain seems to be sent directly by God, and is imparted at such times as are best. It is wholly under his control, and furnishes a constant evidence of his benevolence. Without it, every vegetable would dry up, and every animal on the earth would soon die. The word earth here refers probably to the cultivated part of the earth - the fields that are under tillage. Thus, Eichhorn renders it, Angebauten Feldern. On the interest which the phenomena of rain excited among the ancient sages of Idumea, and the laws by which it is produced, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-15.htm">Job 37:15-16</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22-28</a>, note.<p>And sendeth waters - That is, showers.<p>Upon the fields - Margin, "out-places." Hebrew &#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  chu&#770;tso&#770;t - out of doors, outside, abroad, meaning the fields out of cities and towns. Eichhorn renders it, "the pastures," auf Triften. The meaning is, that the whole country is watered; and the fact that God gives rain in this manner, is a reason why we should put confidence in him. It shows that he is a benevolent Being, since it contributes so essentially to human life and happiness, and since no other being but God can cause it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

To the dweller in the parched regions of South-Western Asia rain is the greatest of all blessings, and seems the greatest, of all  marvels. When for months and months together the sun has blazed all day long out of a cloudless sky, when the heaven that is over his head has been brass, and the earth that is under him iron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>), a great despair comes upon him, and that it should ever rain again seems almost an impossibility. Where is the rain to come from? From that cruel, glaring sky, which has pursued him with its hostility week after week, and month after month? Or from that parched earth in which, as it seems, no atom of moisture is left? When God at length gives rain, he scarcely believes his eyes. What? The blessed moisture is once more descending from the sky, and watering the earth, and quickening what seemed dead, and turning the desert into a garden! All Eastern poetry is full of the praises of rain, of its blessedness, of its marvellousness, and of its quickening power. Very naturally Eliphaz, in speaking of God's marvellous works of mercy, mentions rain first, as, within his experience, one of the chief<span class="cmt_word">. And sendeth waters upon the fields.</span> This is either the usual pleonastic repetition of the second hemistich, or (perhaps) a reference to the fountains and rills of water, which spring into being as a consequence of the rain. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Call now, - is there any one who will answer thee?<p>And to whom of the holy ones wilt thou turn?<p>  2  For he is a fool who is destroyed by complaining,<p>And envy slays the simple one.<p>  3  I, even I, have seen a fool taking root:<p>Then I had to curse his habitation suddenly.<p>  4  His children were far from help,<p>And were crushed in the gate, without a rescuer;<p>  5  While the hungry ate his harvest,<p>And even from among thorns they took it away,<p>And the intriguer snatched after his wealth.<p>The chief thought of the oracle was that God is the absolutely just One, and infinitely exalted above men and angels. Resuming his speech from this point, Eliphaz tells Job that no cry for help can avail him unless he submits to the all-just One as being himself unrighteous; nor can any cry addressed to the angels avail. This thought, although it is rejected, certainly shows that the writer of the book, as of the prologue, is impressed with the fundamental intuition, that good, like evil, spirits are implicated in the affairs of men; for the "holy ones," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, are the angels. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; supports the negation implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a> : If God does not help thee, no creature can help thee; for he who complains and chafes at his lot brings down upon himself the extremest destruction, since he excites the anger of God still more. Such a surly murmurer against God is here called &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;. &#1500; is the Aramaic sign of the object, having the force of quod attinet ad, quoad (Ew. 310, a).<p>Eliphaz justifies what he has said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>) by an example. He had seen such a complainer in increasing prosperity; then he cursed his habitation suddenly, i.e., not: he uttered forthwith a prophetic curse over it, which, though &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1501; might have this meaning (not subito, but illico; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-4.htm">Numbers 12:4</a>), the following futt., equivalent to imperff., do not allow, but: I had then, since his discontent had brought on his destruction, suddenly to mark and abhor his habitation as one overtaken by a curse: the cursing is a recognition of the divine curse, as the echo of which it is intended. This curse of God manifests itself also on his children and his property (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-4.htm">Job 5:4</a>.). &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; is the gate of the city as a court of justice: the phrase, to oppress in the gate, is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22</a>; and the form Hithpa. is according to the rule given in Ges. 54, 2, b. The relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>, is here conj. relativa, according to Ges. 155, 1, c. In the connection &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1488;&#1500; is equivalent to &#1506;&#1491;, adeo e spinis, the hungry fall so eagerly upon what the father of those now orphans has reaped, that even the thorny fence does not hold them back. &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-5.htm">Proverbs 22:5</a> : the double praepos. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1503; is also found elsewhere, but with another meaning. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; has only the appearance of being plur.: it is sing. after the form &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, from the verb &#1510;&#1502;&#1501;, nectere, and signifies, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-9.htm">Job 18:9</a>, a snare; here, however, not judicii laqueus (Bttch.), but what, besides the form, comes still nearer - the snaremaker, intriguer. The Targ. translates &#1500;&#1505;&#1496;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., &#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;. Most modern critics (Rosenm. to Ebr.) translate: the thirsty (needy), as do all the old translations, except the Targ.; this, however, is not possible without changing the form. The meaning is, that intriguing persons catch up (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>) their wealth.<p>Eliphaz now tells why it thus befell this fool in his own person and his children. </body></html>
