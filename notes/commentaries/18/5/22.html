Call it a chastening, which comes from the Father's love, and is for the child's good; and notice it as a messenger from Heaven. Eliphaz also encourages Job to submit to his condition. A good man is happy though he be afflicted, for he has not lost his enjoyment of God, nor his title to heaven; nay, he is happy because he is afflicted. Correction mortifies his corruptions, weans his heart from the world, draws him nearer to God, brings him to his Bible, brings him to his knees. Though God wounds, yet he supports his people under afflictions, and in due time delivers them. Making a wound is sometimes part of a cure. Eliphaz gives Job precious promises of what God would do for him, if he humbled himself. Whatever troubles good men may be in, they shall do them no real harm. Being kept from sin, they are kept from the evil of trouble. And if the servants of Christ are not delivered from outward troubles, they are delivered by them, and while overcome by one trouble, they conquer all. Whatever is maliciously said against them shall not hurt them. They shall have wisdom and grace to manage their concerns. The greatest blessing, both in our employments and in our enjoyments, is to be kept from sin. They shall finish their course with joy and honour. That man lives long enough who has done his work, and is fit for another world. It is a mercy to die seasonably, as the corn is cut and housed when fully ripe; not till then, but then not suffered to stand any longer. Our times are in God's hands; it is well they are so. Believers are not to expect great wealth, long life, or to be free from trials. But all will be ordered for the best. And remark from Job's history, that steadiness of mind and heart under trial, is one of the highest attainments of faith. There is little exercise for faith when all things go well. But if God raises a storm, permits the enemy to send wave after wave, and seemingly stands aloof from our prayers, then, still to hang on and trust God, when we cannot trace him, this is the patience of the saints. Blessed Saviour! how sweet it is to look unto thee, the Author and Finisher of faith, in such moments!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh - That is thou shalt be perfectly safe and happy. They shall not come upon thee; and when they approach with threatening aspect, thou shalt smile with conscious security. The word here rendered famine (&#1499;&#1508;&#1503;  ka&#770;pha&#770;n) is an unusual word, and differs from that occurring in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-20.htm">Job 5:20</a>, &#1512;&#1506;&#1489;  ra&#770;&#8219;a&#770;b. This word is derived from &#1499;&#1508;&#1503;  ka&#770;phan - to languish, to pine from hunger and thirst. It then means the languid and feeble state which exists where there is a lack of proper nutriment. A sentiment similar to that which is here expressed occurs in Martial, iv. 19, 4. Ridebis ventos line munere tectus, et imbres. "Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth." Wild beasts in new countries are always objects of dread, and in the fastnesses and deserts of Arabia, they were especially so. They abounded there; and one of the highest images of happiness there would be, that there would be perfect safety from them. A similar promise occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a> :<p>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder;<p>The young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot.<p>And a promise similar to this was made by the Savior to his disciples: "They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them." The sentiment of Eliphaz is, that they who put their trust in God would find protection, and have the consciousness that they were secure wherever they were. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. famine thou shalt laugh&#8212;Not, in spite of destruction and famine, which is true (Hab 3:17, 18), though not the truth meant by Eliphaz, but because those calamities shall not come upon thee.

The noun &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, coined by the Chokma, and out of Job and Proverbs found only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>, and even there in gnomical connection, is formed from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, essentia, and signifies as it were essentialitas, realitas: it denotes, in relation to all visible things, the truly existing, the real, the objective; true wisdom (i.e., knowledge resting on an objective actual basis), true prosperity, real profiting and accomplishing. It is meant that they accomplish nothing that has actual duration and advantage. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a> cannot be better translated than by Paul, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>, who here deviates from the lxx. With &#1504;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, God's seizure, which prevents the contemplated achievement, is to be thought of. He pours forth over the worldly wise what the prophets call the spirit of deep sleep (&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;) and of dizziness (&#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;). On the other hand, He helps the poor. In &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489; the second &#1502;&#1503; is local: from the sword which proceeds from their mouth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-4.htm">Psalm 64:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>, and other passages). Bttch. translates: without sword, i.e., instrument of power (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>); but &#1502;&#1503; with &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; leads one to expect that that from which one is rescued is to be described (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-20.htm">Job 5:20</a>). Ewald corrects &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, which Olsh. thinks acute: it is, however, unhebraic, according to our present knowledge of the usage of the language; for the passives of &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; are used of cities, countries, and peoples, but not of individual men. Olsh., in his hesitancy, arrives at no opinion. But the text is sound and beautiful. &#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; with pathetic unaccented ah (Ges. 80, rem. 2, f), from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-16.htm">Psalm 92:16</a> Chethib. </body></html>
