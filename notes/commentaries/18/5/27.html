Call it a chastening, which comes from the Father's love, and is for the child's good; and notice it as a messenger from Heaven. Eliphaz also encourages Job to submit to his condition. A good man is happy though he be afflicted, for he has not lost his enjoyment of God, nor his title to heaven; nay, he is happy because he is afflicted. Correction mortifies his corruptions, weans his heart from the world, draws him nearer to God, brings him to his Bible, brings him to his knees. Though God wounds, yet he supports his people under afflictions, and in due time delivers them. Making a wound is sometimes part of a cure. Eliphaz gives Job precious promises of what God would do for him, if he humbled himself. Whatever troubles good men may be in, they shall do them no real harm. Being kept from sin, they are kept from the evil of trouble. And if the servants of Christ are not delivered from outward troubles, they are delivered by them, and while overcome by one trouble, they conquer all. Whatever is maliciously said against them shall not hurt them. They shall have wisdom and grace to manage their concerns. The greatest blessing, both in our employments and in our enjoyments, is to be kept from sin. They shall finish their course with joy and honour. That man lives long enough who has done his work, and is fit for another world. It is a mercy to die seasonably, as the corn is cut and housed when fully ripe; not till then, but then not suffered to stand any longer. Our times are in God's hands; it is well they are so. Believers are not to expect great wealth, long life, or to be free from trials. But all will be ordered for the best. And remark from Job's history, that steadiness of mind and heart under trial, is one of the highest attainments of faith. There is little exercise for faith when all things go well. But if God raises a storm, permits the enemy to send wave after wave, and seemingly stands aloof from our prayers, then, still to hang on and trust God, when we cannot trace him, this is the patience of the saints. Blessed Saviour! how sweet it is to look unto thee, the Author and Finisher of faith, in such moments!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lo this - All this that I have said; the truth of all the remarks which I have made.<p>We have searched it - We have by careful observation of the course of events come to these conclusions. These are our views of the providence of God, and of the principles of his government, as far as we have had the opportunity of observing, and they are well worthy of your attention. The sentiments in these two chapters indicate close and accurate observation; and if we think that the observation was not always wholly accurate, or that the principles were carried further than facts would warrant, or that Eliphaz applied them with somewhat undue severity to the case of Job, we are to remember that this was in the infancy of the world, that they had few historical records, and that they had no written revelation. If they were favored with occasional revelations, as Eliphaz claimed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a> ff), yet they were few in number, and at distant intervals, and the divine communications pertained to but few points.<p>Though it may without impropriety be maintained that some of the views of Eliphaz and his friends were not wholly accurate, yet we may safely ask, Where among the Greek and Roman sages can views of the divine government be found that equal these in correctness, or that are expressed with equal force and beauty? For profound and accurate observation, for beauty of thought and sublimity of expression, the sage of Teman will not fall behind the sages of Athens; and not the least interesting thing in the contemplation of the book of Job, is the comparison which we are almost of necessity compelled to make between the observations on the course of events which were made in Arabia, and those which were made by the philosophers of the ancient pagan world. Is it improper to suppose that one design of this book was to show how far the human mind could go, with the aid of occasional revelations on a few points, in ascertaining the principles of the divine administration, and to demonstrate that, after all, the mind needed a fuller revelation to enable man to comprehend the truths pertaining to the kingdom of God? "Hear it for thy good." Margin, as in Hebrew "thyself." These principles are such that they are of importance for you to understand and to apply. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. searched it &#8230; for thy good&#8212;literally, "for thyself" (Ps 111:2; Pr 2:4; 9:12).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is not my single opinion, but my brethren concur with me, as thou wilt hear from their own mouths.

This is the concluding part of Eliphaz's first oration or speech to Job; and in order to engage his attention to it, observes, that what he had said was not his own single opinion, but the sentiment of the rest of his friends; and that it was the result of laborious and diligent investigation; that they had searched the records of former times, and inquired of ancient people, as well as had made the strictest observations on things during their course of life; <p>so it is; and the sum and amount of all was what he had declared, and which they had found to be sure and certain, the truth of the matter; that it is an undoubted truth, which should not be disputed and called in question, but to be held as a first principle, which was this; that wicked men are punished for their sins, and that good men are never greatly afflicted, at least not to such a degree as to be stripped of all the necessaries of life, and to be in a most desolate and perishing condition; and since this had been so thoroughly investigated by them, and such "a probatum est" was written upon it, he exhorts Job to <p>hear it; agree to it, believe it, receive it, and make a proper use of it, as he hoped he would: <p>and know thou it for thy good; or "for thyself" (s); take it to thyself, as belonging to thee, as suitable to thy case; apply it to thyself, learn some lessons from it, and make good use of it; which is what is proposed by all that has been said. <p>(s)  "scito tibi", Montanus, Mercerus, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Lo <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> this, we have searched it, so it <i>is</i>; hear it, and know thou <i>it</i> for thy good.</span><p>(z) We have learned these points by experience, that God does not punish the innocent, that man cannot compare in justice with him, that the hypocrites will not prosper for long, and that the affliction which man sustains comes for his own sin.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo this, we have searched it, so it is</span>. Eliphaz does not claim to be delivering a Divine message, or in any way stating results which he has learnt from revelation. Rather is he declaring what he has "searched out;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> gathered with much trouble from inquiry, observation, and experience. He is, however, quite confident that he has arrived at a true conclusion, and expects Job to accept it and act upon it. <span class="cmt_word">Hear it, and know thou it for thy good</span>; literally, for <span class="accented">thyself.</span> Make the knowledge, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> which I have communicated to thee, thine own. Professor Lee observes, "Them is nothing in all this savouring of any asperity, as far as I can see, beyond the anxieties of true friendship. The sentiments delivered from ver. 17 to the end of the chapter are not only most excellent in themselves, but perfectly applicable to Job's case; and were, in the event, made good in every respect. It is true, we have not much sympathy expressed for Job's bereavements and afflictions. And, in this respect, Eliphaz was, no doubt, to blame" ('Book of the Patriarch Job' p. 216). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17  Behold, happy is the man whom Eloah correcteth;<p>So despise not the chastening of the Almighty!<p>18  For He woundeth, and He also bindeth up;<p>He bruiseth, and His hands make whole.<p>19  In six troubles He will rescue thee,<p>And in seven no evil shall touch thee.<p>20  In famine He will redeem thee from death,<p>And in war from the stroke of the sword.<p>21  When the tongue scourgeth, thou shalt be hidden;<p>And thou shalt not fear destruction when it cometh.<p>The speech of Eliphaz now becomes persuasive as it turns towards the conclusion. Since God humbles him who exalts himself, and since He humbles in order to exalt, it is a happy thing when He corrects (&#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;) us by afflictive dispensations; and His chastisement (&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;) is to be received not with a turbulent spirit, but resignedly, yea joyously: the same thought as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>, in both passages borrowed from this; whereas <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a> here, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31</a>., refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>. &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;, to heal, is here conjugated like a &#1492;&#1500; verb (Ges. 75, rem. 21). <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a> is formed after the manner of the so-called number-proverbs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-18.htm">Proverbs 30:18</a>), as also the roll of the judgment of the nations in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1.htm">Amos 1-2</a>: in six troubles, yea in still more than six. &#1512;&#1506; is the extremity that is perhaps to be feared. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-20.htm">Job 5:20</a>, the praet. is a kind of prophetic praet. The scourge of the tongue recalls the similar promise, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-21.htm">Psalm 31:21</a>, where, instead of scourge, it is: the disputes of the tongue. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1491;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; violence, disaster, is allied in sound with &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496;. Isaiah has this passage of the book of Job in his memory when he writes <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15</a>. The promises of Eliphaz now continue to rise higher, and sound more delightful and more glorious. </body></html>
