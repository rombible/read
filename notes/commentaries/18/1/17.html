Why they thus expressed it is unknown. It may be possible that the Chaldeans were supposed to be distinguished as horsemen, and were principally known as such in their predatory excursions. But it is impossible to account for all the changes made by the Septuagint in the text. Tho Syriac and the Chaldee render it correctly, "Chaldeans." The Chaldeans (Hebrew &#1499;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; kas&#769;d&#305;&#770;ym) were the ancient inhabitants of Babylonia. According to Vitringa (Commentary in Isa. tom. i. p. 412, c. xiii. 19), Gesenius (Commentary zu <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>), and Rosenmailer (Bib. Geog. 1, 2, p. 36ff), the Chaldees or Casdim were a warlike people who orignally inhabited the Carduchian mountains, north of Assyria, and the northern part of Mesopotamia. According to Xenophon (Cyrop. iii. 2, 7) the Chaldees dwelt in the mountains adjacent to Armenia and they were found in the same region in the campaign of the younger Cyrus, and the retreat of the ten thousand Greeks. Xen. Anaba. iv. 3, 4; v. 5, 9; viii. 8, 14.<p>They were allied to the Hebrews, as appears from <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-22.htm">Genesis 22:22</a>, where &#1499;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;  kes&#769;ed (whence "Kasdim") the ancestor of the people is mentioned as a son of Nabor, and was consequently the nephew of Abraham. And further, Abraham himself emigrated to Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees &#1499;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;  'u&#770;r kas&#769;d&#305;&#770;ym, "Ur of the Kasdim"), <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-28.htm">Genesis 11:28</a>; and in Judith 5:6, the Hebrews themselves are said to be descended from the Chaldeans. The region around the river Chaboras, in the northern part of Mesopotamia, is called by Ezekiel E<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a> "the land of the Chaldeans;" Jeremiah Jer 5:15 calls them "an ancient nation;" see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>. The Chaldeans were a fierce and warlike people, and when they were subdued by the Assyrians, a portion of them appear to have been placed in Babylon to ward off the incursions of the neighboring Arabians. In time "they" gained the ascendency over their Assyrian masters, and grew into the mighty empire of Chaldea or Babylonia. A part of them, however, appear to have remained in their ancient country, and enjoyed under the Persians some degree of liberty. Gesenius supposes that the Kurds who have inhabited those regions, at least since the middle ages, are probably the descendants of that people. - A very vivid and graphic description of the Chaldeans is given by the prophet Habakkuk, which will serve to illustrate the passage before us, and show that they retained until his times the predatory and fierce character which they had in the days of Job; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-11</a> :<p>For lo I raise up the Chaldeans,<p>A bitter and hasty nation,<p>Which marches far and wide in the earth.<p>To possess the dwellings which are not theirs.<p>They are terrible and dreadful,<p>Their judgments proceed only from themselves.<p>Swifter titan leopards are their horses,<p>And fiercer than the evening wolves.<p>Their horsemen prance proudly around;<p>And their horsemen shall come from afar and fly,<p>Like the eagle when he pounces on his prey.<p>They all shall come for violence,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

When their seat of empire was in the south, towards the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. The Chaldean period, from 2300 B.C. to 1500 B.C. In this period was Chedorlaomer (Ge 14:1), the Kudur of Hur or Ur of the Chaldees, in the Assyrian inscriptions, and the conqueror of Syria. 2. From 1500 to 625 B.C., the Assyrian period. 3.

They were akin, perhaps, to the Hebrews, as Abraham's sojourn in Ur, and the name "Chesed," a nephew of Abraham, imply.

And there is no evidence of any connection between Chesed, who was born at Haran, and the Babylonian Chaldeans. The Chaldeans were probably early settlers in Babylonia; by degrees they were pressed to the south, and gave the name of Chaldea to Lower Babylonia, or the tract nearest to the Persian Gulf (Strab., 16:1, &sect; 66; Ptolemy, 'Geographia,' 5:20).

Hast Thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Hast Thou not blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land? But put forth Thine hand now, and touch all that he hath: truly he will renounce Thee to Thy face.<p>Satan is, according to the <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>, the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; who accuses the servants of God day and night before God. It is a fact respecting the invisible world, though expressed in the language and imagery of this world. So long as he is not finally vanquished and condemned, he has access to God, and thinks to justify himself by denying the truth of the existence and the possibility of the continuance of all piety. God permits it; for since everything happening to the creature is placed under the law of free development, evil in the world of spirits is also free to maintain and expand itself, until a spiritual power comes forward against it, by which the hitherto wavering conflict between the principles of good and evil is decided. This is the truth contained in the poetic description of the heavenly scene, sadly mistaken by Umbreit in his Essay on Sin, 1853, in which he explains Satan, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>, as a creation of our author's fancy. The paucity of the declarations respecting Satan in the Old Testament has misled him. And indeed the historical advance from the Old Testament to the New, though in itself well authorized, has in many ways of late induced to the levelling of the heights and depths of the New Testament. Formerly Umbreit was of the opinion, as many are still, that the idea of Satan is derived from Persia; but between Ahriman (Angramainyus) and Satan there is no striking resemblance;<p>(Note: Moreover, it is still questionable whether the form of the ancient doctrine of fire-worship among the Persians did not result from Jewish influences. Vid., Stuhr, Religionssysteme der herdn. Vlker des Orients, S. 373-75.)<p>whereas Diestel, in his Abh. ber Set-Typhon, Asasel und Satan, Stud. u. Krit., 1860, 2, cannot indeed recognise any connection between &#1506;&#1494;&#1488;&#1494;&#1500; and the Satan of the book of Job, but maintains a more complete harmony in all substantial marks between the latter and the Egyptian Typhon, and infers that "to Satan is therefore to be denied a purely Israelitish originality, the natural outgrowth of the Hebrew mind. It is indeed no special honour for Israel to be able to call him their own. He never has taken firm hold on the Hebrew consciousness." But how should it be no honour for Israel, the people to whom the revelation of redemption was made, and in whose history the plan of redemption was developed, to have traced the poisonous stream of evil up to the fountain of its first free beginning in the spiritual world, and to have more than superficially understood the history of the fall of mankind by sin, which points to a disguised superhuman power, opposed to the divine will? This perception undoubtedly only begins gradually to dawn in the Old Testament; but in the New Testament, the abyss of evil is fully disclosed, and Satan has so far a hold on the consciousness of Jesus, that He regards His life's vocation as a conflict with Satan. And the Protevangelium is deciphered in facts, when the promised seed of the woman crushed the serpent's head, but at the same time suffered the bruising of its own heel.<p>The view (e.g., Lutz in his Biblishce Dogmatik) that Satan as he is represented in the book of Job is not the later evil spirit, is to be rejected: he appears here only first, say Herder and Eichhorn, as impartial executor of judgment, and overseer of morality, commissioned by God. But he denies what God affirms, acknowledges no love towards God in the world which is not rooted in self-love, and is determined to destroy this love as a mere semblance. Where piety is dulled, he rejoices in its obscurity; where it is not, he dims its lustre by reflecting his own egotistical nature therein. Thus it is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-10</a>, and so here. Genuine love loves God &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; (adverb from &#1495;&#1503;, like gratis from gratia): it loves Him for His own sake; it is a relation of person to person, without any actual stipulations and claim. But Job does not thus fear God; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488; is here praet., whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a> it is the adjective. God has indeed hitherto screened him from all evil; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468; from &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, sepire, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;) composed of &#1489;&#1468; and &#1506;&#1491;, in the primary signification circum, since &#1506;&#1491; expresses that the one joins itself to the other, and &#1489;&#1468; that it covers it, or covers itself with it. By the addition of &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, the idea of the triple &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; is still strengthened. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, lxx, Vulg., have translated by the plural, which is not false according to the thought; for &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is, especially in Deuteronomy, a favourite collective expression for human enterprise. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, a word, with the Sanskrito-Sem. frangere, related to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, signifying to break through the bounds, multiply and increase one's self unboundedly (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>, and freq.). The particle &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, proper only to the oldest and classic period, and very commonly used in the first four books of the Pentateuch, and in our book, generally &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, is an emphatic "nevertheless;" Lat. (suited to this passage at least) verum enim vero. &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; is either, as frequently, a shortened formula of asseveration: May such and such happen to me if he do not, etc.,  equals  forsooth he will (lxx &#x3b7;&#787;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;); or it is half a question: Attempt only this and this, whether he will not deny thee,  equals  annon, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-2.htm">Job 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20</a>. The first perhaps suits the character of Satan better: he affirms that God is mistaken. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; signifies here also, valedicere: he will say farewell to thee, and indeed &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>), meeting thee arrogantly and shamelessly: it signifies, properly, upon thy countenance, i.e., say it to thee, to the very face, that he will have nothing more to do with thee (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>). In order now that the truth of His testimony to Job's piety, and this piety itself, may be tried, Jehovah surrenders all Job's possessions, all that is his, except himself, to Satan. </body></html>
