He reasons from the common state of human life, which he describes. We brought nothing of this world's goods into the world, but have them from others; and it is certain we can carry nothing out, but must leave them to others. Job, under all his losses, is but reduced to his first state. He is but where he must have been at last, and is only unclothed, or unloaded rather, a little sooner than he expected. If we put off our clothes before we go to bed, it is some inconvenience, but it may be the better borne when it is near bed-time. The same who gave hath taken away. See how Job looks above instruments, and keeps his eye upon the First Cause. Afflictions must not divert us from, but quicken us to religion. If in all our troubles we look to the Lord, he will support us. The Lord is righteous. All we have is from his gift; we have forfeited it by sin, and ought not to complain if he takes any part from us. Discontent and impatience charge God with folly. Against these Job carefully watched; and so must we, acknowledging that as God has done right, but we have done wickedly, so God has done wisely, but we have done very foolishly. And may the malice and power of Satan render that Saviour more precious to our souls, who came to destroy the works of the devil; who, for our salvation, suffered from that enemy far more than Job suffered, or we can think.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Job arose - The phrase to arise, in the Scriptures is often used in the sense of beginning to do anything.

Niebuhr, Reisebescreib. 1. 157. Over these garments they often throw a full and flowing mantle or robe. This is made without sleeves; it reaches down to the ankles; and when they walk or exercise it is bound around the middle with a girdle or sash. When they labor it is usually laid aside. The robe here referred ire was worn sometimes by women, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-18.htm">2 Samuel 13:18</a>; by men of birth and rank, and by kings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>; by priests, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-14.htm">1 Samuel 28:14</a>, and especially by the high priest under the ephod, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31</a>.

Job arose&#8212;not necessarily from sitting. Inward excitement is implied, and the beginning to do anything. He had heard the other messages calmly, but on hearing of the death of his children, then he arose; or, as Eichorn translates, he started up (2Sa 13:31). The rending of the mantle was the conventional mark of deep grief (Ge 37:34). Orientals wear a tunic or shirt, and loose pantaloons; and over these a flowing mantle (especially great persons and women). Shaving the head was also usual in grief (Jer 41:5; Mic 1:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then Job arose from his seat, </span> whereon he was sitting in a disconsolate posture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Rent his mantle, </span> to testify his deep sense of and just sorrow for the heavy hand of God upon him, and his humiliation of himself under his hand.

Either from table, being at dinner, as some think, in his own house; it being the time that his children were feasting in their eldest brother's house; or from the business in which he was employed, which he stopped on hearing this news; or from his seat, or chair of state in which he sat; or rather the phrase only signifies, that he at once, with strength of body, and rigour of mind, which were not lost, as often they are in such cases, went about the following things with great composure and sedateness. It is indeed generally observed, that there is an emphasis to be put on the word "then", which may be as well rendered "and", as if Job sat and heard very sedately, without any perturbation of mind, the loss of his substance; but when tidings were brought him of the death of his children, "then" he arose, as being greatly moved and distressed; but it should be observed till now there was no stop or intermission in the messengers, but before one had done speaking, another came and began to tell his story, and so there was no opportunity, as well as not the occasion, of arising and doing what follows; and which he did, not through the violence of his passion, or excess of grief, but as common and ordinary things, which were used to be done in that country for the loss of relations, and in token of mourning for them: <p>and rent his mantle; or "cloak" (k), as Mr. Broughton; but whether this was an outward garment, as each of these seem to be, if the same with ours, or an interior one, as some think, it is not very material to know; both were rent by Ezra upon a mournful occasion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>, and it was usual to rend garments for deceased relations, or when they were thought to be so, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a>, though some think that this was on the account of the blasphemous thoughts the devil now suggested into his mind, being solicitous to gain his point, and work upon him to curse God; upon which he rent his garment to show his resentment and indignation at the thought of it, as the Jews used to rend their garments at hearing of blasphemy; but the first sense is best: <p>and shaved his beard; either he himself, or his servant by his orders; and which was done among the eastern nations as a sign of mourning, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> and among the Greeks, as appears from Homer (l); nor was this contrary to the law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>, where another baldness, not of the head, but between the eyes, is forbidden for the dead; besides this was before that law was in being, and, had it been, Job was not bound by it, being not of the Israelitish nation: some, as Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and other Jewish writers, interpret this of his plucking or tearing off the hair of his head; but this neither agrees with the sense of the word here used, which has the signification of shearing or mowing, rather than of tearing or plucking, nor with the firmness and composure of Job's mind, who betrayed not any effeminacy or weakness; and though he showed a natural affection for the loss of his substance, and children, as a man, and did not affect a stoical apathy, and brutal insensibility, yet did not give any extraordinary vent to his passion: he behaved both like a man, and a religious man; he mourned for his dead, but not to excess; he sorrowed not as those without hope, and used the common tokens of it, and rites attending it; which shows that mourning for deceased relations, if done in moderation, is not unlawful, nor complying with the rites and customs of a country, in such cases, provided they are not sinful in themselves, nor contrary to the revealed and declared will of God: <p>and fell down upon the ground; in veneration of God, of his holiness and justice, and as sensible of his awful hand upon him, and as being humbled under it, and patiently submitting to it; he did not stand up, and curse God to his face, as Satan said he would, but fell upon his face to the ground; he did not curse his King and his God, and look upwards, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a> but prostrated himself to the earth in great humility before him; besides, this may be considered as a prayer gesture, since it follows: <p>and worshipped; that is, God, for who else should he worship? he worshipped him internally in the exercise of faith, hope, love, humility, patience, &amp;c. and he worshipped him externally by praising him, and praying to him, expressing himself as in the next verse: afflictions, when sanctified, humble good men, cause them to lie low in the dust, and bring them near to God, to the throne of his grace, and instead of arraigning his providence, and finding fault with his dealings, they adore his majesty, and celebrate his perfections. <p>(k)  "pallium suum", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Schultens; "tunicam suam", Munster, Cocceius, Schmidt, Jo.

Job’s demeanour under his sorrows. As became a man of his rank Job had received the messengers sitting. When the full extent of his misery came home to him he arose and gave way to the liveliest expressions of grief. He rent his mantle, in token that his heart was rent with sorrow, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm" title="And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents him of the evil.">Joel 2:13</a> says, “Rend your heart and not your garments;” he shaved his head, putting off, in token of his mourning, every adornment, even that which nature had supplied; and he cast himself upon the ground, laying his forehead on the dust, in deepest submission before God. Grief has its rights, which religion stands by to see fulfilled, and then comes forward to hallow it and cast its peace over it.—The “mantle” (me‘eel) was not a detached garment as the word might suggest, but a tunic, the uppermost of the garments proper. It was worn by women of the higher rank, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-18.htm" title="And she had a garment of divers colors on her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins appareled.

The details which follow are important. Job had celebrated the usual weekly worship early in the morning with his children, and knew that they were met together in the house of his eldest son, with whom the order of mutual entertainment came round again, when the messengers of misfortune began to break in upon him: it is therefore on the very day when, by reason of the sacrifice offered, he was quite sure of Jehovah's favour. The participial construction, the oxen were ploughing (vid., Ges. 134, 2, c), describes the condition which was disturbed by the calamity that befell them. The verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; stands here because the clause is a principal one, not as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13</a>, adverbial. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, properly "at hand," losing its radical meaning, signifies (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-26.htm">Judges 11:26</a>) "close by." The interpretation "in their places," after <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>, is untenable, as this signification of &#1497;&#1491; is only supported in the sing. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1488; is construed as fem., since the name of the country is used as the name of the people. In Genesis three races of this name are mentioned: Cushite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>), Joktanish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-28.htm">Genesis 10:28</a>), and Abrahamic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>). Here the nomadic portion of this mixed race in North Arabia from the Persian Gulf to Idumaea is intended. Luther, for the sake of clearness, translates here, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>, Arabia. In &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492;, the waw, as is seen from the Kametz, is waw convertens, and the paragogic ah, which otherwise indicates the cohortative, is either without significance, or simply adds intensity to the verbal idea: I have saved myself with great difficulty. For this common form of the 1 fut. consec., occurring four times in the Pentateuch, vid., Ges. 49, 2. The clause &#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is objective: in order that - so it was intended by the calamity - I might tell thee. </body></html>
