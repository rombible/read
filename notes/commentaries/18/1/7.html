But, as we have stated above, the whole is parabolical and emblematical. <span class="ital">Whence comest thou? — </span>God, being here represented as Judge, begins with an <span class="ital">inquiry </span>as the ground of his further proceedings, as he did with our first parents, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-9.htm" title="And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where are you?">Genesis 3:9</a>, and with Cain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother?

The Targum, after the words, <span class="ital">from going to and fro in the earth, </span>very significantly adds, <span class="ital">to try the works of the children of men. </span>From which it appears, that the ancient Jews understood this account of the temptation of Job in a literal sense. This representation teaches us, that Satan, the great apostate spirit, is entirely under the dominion of the sovereign Lord of all things, and not suffered to act without control; and that he is chiefly confined to the limits of this earth; agreeably to which he is called, in the New Testament, the <span class="ital">Prince of this world, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>. And from this and many other passages in Scripture, we may learn that it is his employment to seek for all opportunities to delude the human race. The New Testament frequently mentions the temptations, wiles, and snares of the devil. And St. Peter describes him as doing the same thing which he is here said to do, namely, <span class="ital">walking about </span>as an adversary to man, <span class="ital">seeking whom he may devour; </span>roving to and fro with an evil intention, and a determined resolution of doing mischief.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-12 Job's afflictions began from the malice of Satan, by the Lord's permission, for wise and holy purposes. There is an evil spirit, the enemy of God, and of all righteousness, who is continually seeking to distress, to lead astray, and, if possible, to destroy those who love God. How far his influence may extend, we cannot say; but probably much unsteadiness and unhappiness in Christians may be ascribed to him. While we are on this earth we are within his reach. Hence it concerns us to be sober and vigilant, 1Pe 5:8. See how Satan censures Job. This is the common way of slanderers, to suggest that which they have no reason to think is true. But as there is nothing we should dread more than really being hypocrites, so there is nothing we need dread less than being called and counted so without cause. It is not wrong to look at the eternal recompence in our obedience; but it is wrong to aim at worldly advantages in our religion. God's people are taken under his special protection; they, and all that belong to them. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; Satan himself owns it. God suffered Job to be tried, as he suffered Peter to be sifted. It is our comfort that God has the devil in a chain, Re 20:1. He has no power to lead men to sin, but what they give him themselves; nor any power to afflict men, but what is given him from above. All this is here described to us after the manner of men. The Scripture speaks thus to teach us that God directs the affairs of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? - This inquiry does not appear to have been made as if it was improper that Satan should have appeared there, for no blame seems to have been attached to him for this. He came as a spirit that was subject to the control of yahweh; he came with others, not to mingle in their society, and partake of their happiness, but to give an account of what he had done, and of what he had observed. The poetic idea is, that this was done periodically, and that "all" the spirits employed by yahweh to dispense blessings to mortals, to inflict punishment, or to observe their conduct, came and stood before him. Why the inquiry is directed particularly to "Satan," is not specified. Perhaps it is not meant that there was any "special" inquiry made of him, but that, as he was to have so important an agency in the transactions which follow, the inquiry that was made of him only is recorded In respect to the others, nothing occurred pertaining to Job, and their examination is not adverted to. Or it may be, that, as Satan was known to be malignant, suspicious, and disposed to think evil of the servants of God, the design was to direct his attention particularly to Job as an illustrious and indisputable example of virtue and piety.<p>From going to and fro in the earth - Dr. Good renders this, "from roaming round." Noyes, "from wandering over." The word which is here used (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;  shu&#770;t&#803;) means properly,<p>(1.) to whip, to scourge, to lash;<p>(2.) to row, that is, to lash the sea with oars;<p>(3.) to run up and down, to go here and there, or to and fro, so as to lash the air with one's arms as with oars, and hence, to travel over a land, or to go through it in order to see it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-2.htm">2 Samuel 24:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-8.htm">2 Samuel 24:8</a>.<p>Dr. Good, in conformity with the interpretation proposed by Schultens, says that "the word imports, not so much the act of going forward and backward, as of making a circuit or circumference; of going round about. The Hebrew verb is still in use among the Arabic writers, and in every instance implies the same idea of gyration or circumambulation." In Arabic, according to Castell, the word means "to heat, to burn, to cause to boil, to consume:" then to propel to weariness, as e. g. a horse, and then to make a circuit, to go about at full speed, to go with diligence and activity. Thus, in Carnuso, as quoted by Schultens, "a course made at one impulse to the goal is called &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496;  sho&#770;t&#803;. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-2.htm">2 Samuel 24:2</a>, the word is used in the sense of passing around through different places for the purpose of taking a census. "Go now (Margin, "compass") through all the tribes of Israel." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-8.htm">Numbers 11:8</a>, it is applied to the Israelites going about to collect manna, passing rapidly and busily in the places where it fell for the purpose of gathering it.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, it is applied to "the eyes of Yahweh," which are said to "run to and fro through the earth," that is, he surveys all things as one does whose eye passes rapidly from object to object. The same phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>, it is applied to the action of a man passing rapidly through the streets of a city. "Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem "compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>. From these passages it is clear that the idea is not that of going "in a circuit" or circle, but it is that of passing rapidly; of moving with alacrity and in a hurry; and it is not improbable that the "original" idea is that suggested in the Arabic of "heat" - and thence applied to a whip or scourge because it produces a sensation like burning, and also to a rapid journey or motion, because it produces heat or a glow. It means that Satan had been active and diligent in passing from place to place in the earth to survey it. The Chaldee adds to this, "to examine into the works of the sons of men."<p>And from walking - That is, to investigate human affairs. On this verse it is observed by Rosenmullcr, that in the life of Zoroaster (see Zendavesta by John G. Kleukner, vol. 3: p. 11,) the prince of the evil demons, the angel of death, whose name is "Engremeniosch," is said to go far and near through the world for the purpose of injuring and opposing good people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. going to and fro&#8212;rather, "hurrying rapidly to and fro." The original idea in Arabic is the heat of haste (Mt 12:43; 1Pe 5:8). Satan seems to have had some peculiar connection with this earth. Perhaps he was formerly its ruler under God. Man succeeded to the vice royalty (Ge 1:26; Ps 8:6). Man then lost it and Satan became prince of this world. The Son of man (Ps 8:4)&#8212;the representative man, regains the forfeited inheritance (Re 11:15). Satan's replies are characteristically curt and short. When the angels appear before God, Satan is among them, even as there was a Judas among the apostles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God being here represented as Judge, rightly begins with an inquiry, as the ground of his further proceedings, as he did <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-9.htm" title="And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where are you?">Genesis 3:9</a> 4:9</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From going to and fro in the earth; </span> where by thy permission I range about, observing with great diligence all the dispositions and actions of men, and working in them and among them as far as I have liberty and opportunity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Satan, whence comest thou?....

There, in the Arabian desert west from Babylon, under the Caucabenes, according to Ptolemy (v. 19, 2), the &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), i.e., the Uzzites, dwelt. This determination of the position of Uz is the most to be relied on. It tends indirectly to confirm this, that &#x39f;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in Jos. Ant. i. 6, 4, is described as founder of Trachonitis and Damascus; that the Jakut Hamawi and Moslem tradition generally (as recently Fries, Stud. u. Krit. 1854, ii.) mention the East Haran fertile tract of country north-west of Tm and Bzn, el-Bethenije, the district of Damascus in which Job dwelt; <p>(Note: Vid., Abulfeda, Historia anteislam. p. 26 (cf. 207f.), where it says, "The whole of Bethenije, a part of the province of Damascus, belonged to Job as his possession.")<p>that the Syrian tradition also transfers the dwelling-place of Job to Hauran, where, in the district of Damascus, a monastery to his honour is called Dair Ejjub (vid., Volck, Calendarium Syriacum, p. 29). All these accounts agree that Uz is not to be sought in Idumaea proper (Gebl). And the early historical genealogies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-28.htm">Genesis 36:28</a>) are not unfavourable to this, since they place Uz in relation to Seir-Edom on the one hand, and on the other to Aram: the perplexing double occurrence of such names as Tm and Dma, both in Idumaea and East Hauran, perhaps just results from the mixing of the different tribes through migration. But at all events, though Uz did not lie in Gebl, yet both from <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>, and on account of the reference in the book of Job itself to the Horites, a geographical connection between Idumaea and Ausitis is to be held; and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a> one is warranted in supposing, that &#1506;&#1493;&#1509;, with which the Arabic name of Esau, &#8219;ys&#803; ('l-&#8219;ys&#803;), perhaps not accidentally accords, was the collective name of the northern part of the Arabian desert, extending north-east from Idumaea towards Syria. Here, where the aborigines of Seir were driven back by the Aramaic immigrants, and to where in later times the territory of Edom extended, dwelt Job. His name is not symbolic with reference to the following history. It has been said, &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; signifies one hostilely treated, by Satan namely.<p>(Note: Geiger (DMZ, 1858, S. 542f.) conjectures that, Sir. xlix. 9 (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;), &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; is a false translation of &#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1489;.

Schmidt, p. 305): perhaps all these names belong to the root &#1497;&#1489;, to shout with joy. The lxx writes &#x399;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b2; with lenis; elsewhere the &#1488; at the beginning is rendered by asper, e.g., &#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;, &#x397;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. Luther writes Hiob; he has preferred the latter mode, that it may not be read Job with the consonantal Jod, when it should be Iob, as e.g., it is read by the English. It had been more correctly Ijob, but Luther wished to keep to the customary form of the name so far as he could; so we, by writing Iob with vowel I, do not wish to deviate too much from the mode of writing and pronunciation customary since Luther.<p>(Note: On the authorizing of the writing Iob, more exactly ob, also job (not, however, Ijjob, which does not correspond to the real pronunciation, which softens ij into , and uw into ), vid., Fleischer's Beitrge zur arab. Sprachkunde (Abh. der schs. Gesellschaft d. Wissenschaften, 1863), S. 137f. [The usual English form Job is adopted here, though Dr. Delitzsch writes Iob in the original work. - Tr.])<p>The writer intentionally uses four synonyms together, in order to describe as strongly as possible Job's piety, the reality and purity of which is the fundamental assumption of the history. &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, with the whole heart disposed towards God and what is good, and also well-disposed toward mankind; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, in thought and action without deviation conformed to that which is right; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;, fearing God, and consequently being actuated by the fear of God, which is the beginning (i.e., principle) of wisdom; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; &#1505;&#1512;, keeping aloof from evil, which is opposed to God. The first predicate recalls <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>, the fourth the proverbial Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-27.htm">Psalm 37:27</a>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>.
