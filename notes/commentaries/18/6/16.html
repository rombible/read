This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which are blackish - Or, rather, which are turbid. The word used here (&#1511;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  qoder&#305;&#770;ym) means to be turbid, foul, or muddy, spoken of a torrent, and then to be of a dusky color, to be dark-colored, as e. g. the skin scorched by the sun, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>; or to be dark - as when the sun is obscured; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>. Jerome renders it, Qui timent pruinam - "which fear the frost, when the snow comes upon them." The Septuagint renders it, "they who had venerated me now rushed upon me like snow or hoar frost, which melting at the approach of heat, it was not known whence it was." The expression in the Hebrew means that they were rendered dark and turbid by the accumulated torrents caused by the dissolving snow and ice.<p>By reason of the ice - When it melts and swells the streams.<p>And wherein the snow is hid - That is, says Noyes, melts and flows into them. It refers to the melting of the snow in the spring, when the streams are swelled as a consequence of it. Snow, by melting in the spring and summer, would swell the streams, which at other times were dry. Lucretius mentions the melting of the snows on the mountains of Ethiopia, as one of the causes of the overflowing of the Nile:<p>Forsitan Aethiopum pentrue de montibus altis<p>Crescat, ubi in campos albas descendere ningues<p>Tahificiss subigit radiis sol, omnia lustrans.<p>vi. 734.<p>Or, from the Ethiop-mountains, the bright sun,<p>Now full matured, with deep-dissolving ray,<p>May melt the agglomerate snows, and down the plains<p>Drive them, augmenting hence the incipient stream.<p>Good<p>A similar description occurs in Homer, Iliad xi. 492:<p>&#x3a9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b5; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. blackish&#8212;literally, "Go as a mourner in black clothing" (Ps 34:14).

When frozen over, they look of a blackish colour, and is what is called a black frost; and these either describe Job and his domestics, as some (h) think whom Eliphaz and his two friends compared to the above streams water passed away from, or passed by and neglected, and showed no friendship to; who were in black, mournful and rueful circumstances, through the severe hand of God upon them. The word is rendered, "those which mourn", <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-11.htm">Job 5:11</a>; or rather the friends of Job compared to foul and troubled waters frozen over which cannot be so well discerned, or which were black through being frozen, and which describes the inward frame of their minds the foulness of their spirits the blackness of their hearts, though they outwardly appeared otherwise, as follows: <p>and wherein the snow is hid; or "on whom the snow" falling, and lying on heaps, "hides" (i), or covers; so Job's friends, according to this account, were, though black within as a black frost yet white without as snow; they appeared, in their looks and words at first as candid, kind, and generous, but proved the reverse. <p>(h) So Michaelis.

Job seems to have seen wadys where, in the winter-time, the water was actually frozen into hard black ice.

Hupfeld prefers to read &#1493;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; instead of &#1493;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-8.htm">Job 6:8</a>); but death, which he desires, he even indeed expects. This is just the paradox, that not life, but death, is his expectation. "Cut me off," i.e., my soul or my life, my thread of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>). The optative &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1502;&#1497; (Ges. 136, 1) is followed by optative futt., partly of the so-called jussive form, as &#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, velit (Hiph. from &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;, velle), and &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, solvat (Hiph. from &#1504;&#1514;&#1512;). In the phrase &#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, the stretching out of the hand is regarded as the loosening of what was hitherto bound. The conclusion begins with &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;, just like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>. But it is to be asked whether by consolation speedy death is to be understood, and the clause with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; gives the ground of his claim for the granting of the wish, - or whether he means that just this: not having disowned the words of the Holy One (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>., and &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; in the mouth of Balaam, the non-Israelitish prophet, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-16.htm">Numbers 24:16</a>), would be his consolation in the midst of death. With Hupfeld we decide in favour of the latter, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-50.htm">Psalm 119:50</a> in view: this consciousness of innocence is indeed throughout the whole book Job's shield and defence. If, however, &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; (with Kametz impurum) points towards &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, quod, etc., the clause &#1493;&#1488;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; is parenthetical. The cohortative is found thus parenthetical with a conjunctive sense also elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>). Accordingly: my comfort - I would exult, etc. - would be that I, etc. The meaning of &#1505;&#1500;&#1491;, tripudiare, is confirmed by the lxx &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, in connection with the Arabic s&#803;alada (of a galloping horse which stamps hard with its fore-feet), according to which the Targ. also translates &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (I will rejoice).<p>(Note: The primary meaning of &#1505;&#1500;&#1491;, according to the Arabic, is to be hard, then, to tread hard, firm, as in pulsanda tellus; whereas the poetry of the synagogue (Pijut) uses &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification to supplicate, and &#1505;&#1500;&#1491;, litany (not: hymn, as Zunz gives it); and the Mishna-talmudic &#1505;&#1500;&#1491; signifies to singe, burn one's self, and to draw back affrighted.)<p>For &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>. (break in pieces unsparingly). &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488; certainly appears as though it must be referred to God (Ew., Hahn, Schlottm., and others), since &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; sounds feminine; but one can either pronounce &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; as Milel (Hitz.), or take &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488; adverbially, and not as an elliptical dependent clause (as Ges. 147, rem. 1), but as virtually an adjective: in pain unsparing. </body></html>
