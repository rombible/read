Bishop Patrick’s paraphrase on this verse is, “God hath not made me insensible; and therefore do not wonder that I desire to be released from these very sharp pains.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:8-13 Job had desired death as the happy end of his miseries. For this, Eliphaz had reproved him, but he asks for it again with more vehemence than before. It was very rash to speak thus of God destroying him. Who, for one hour, could endure the wrath of the Almighty, if he let loose his hand against him? Let us rather say with David, O spare me a little. Job grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience, that he had been, in some degree, serviceable to the glory of God. Those who have grace in them, who have the evidence of it, and have it in exercise, have wisdom in them, which will be their help in the worst of times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is my strength the strength of stones? - That is, like a rampart or fortification made of stones, or like a craggy rock that can endure assaults made upon it. A rock will bear the beatings of the tempest, and resist the floods, but how can frail man do it? The idea of Job is, that he had no strength to bear up against these accumulated trials; that he was afraid that he should be left to sink under them, and to complain of God; and that his friends were not to wonder if his strength gave way, and he uttered the language of complaint.<p>Or is my flesh of brass? - Margin, "brazen." The comparison used here is not uncommon. So Cicero, Aca. Qu. iv. 31, says, Non enim est e saxo sculptus, ant e robore dolatus homo; habet corpus, habet animum; movetur mente, movetur sensibus: - "for man is not chiselled out of the rock, nor cut from a tree; he has a body, he has a soul; he is actuated by mind, he is swayed by senses." So Theocritus, in his description of Amycus, Idyll. xxii. 47:<p>&#x3a3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;,<p>&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;.<p>Ste&#772;thea d' esfairo&#772;to pelo&#772;ria kai platu no&#772;ton,<p>Sarki sidareie&#772; sfure&#772;lakos hoia kolossos.<p>Round as to his vast breast and broad back, and with iron flesh, he is as if a colossus formed with a hammer - So in Homer the expression frequently occurs - &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;  side&#772;reion e&#772;tor - an iron heart - to denote courage. And so, according to Schultens, it has come to be a proverb, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  ouk apo druos, ouk apo petre&#772;s - not from a tree, not from a rock. The meaning of Job is plain. He had flesh like others. His muscles, and nerves, and sinews, could not bear a constant force applied to them, as if they were made of brass or iron. They must give way; and he apprehended that he would sink under these sorrows, and be left to use language that might dishonor God. At all events, he felt that these great sorrows justified the strong expressions which he had already employed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Disease had so attacked him that his strength would need to be hard as a stone, and his flesh like brass, not to sink under it. But he has only flesh, like other men. It must, therefore, give way; so that the hope of restoration suggested by Eliphaz is vain (see on [496]Job 5:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I am not made of stone or brass, but of flesh and blood, as others are; and therefore I am utterly unable to endure these miseries longer, and can neither hope for nor desire any continuance of my life, or restoration of my former happiness, but only wish for that death which is the common refuge of all miserable persons, as I said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-17.htm" title="There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.">Job 3:17</a>,18</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Is my strength the strength of stones?....

"Without salt" is virtually adjective to &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;, insipid, tasteless. What is without salt one does not relish, and there is no flavour in the slime of the yolk of an egg, i.e., the white of an egg (Targ.), <p>(Note: Saadia compares b. Aboda zara, 40, a, where it is given as a mark of the purity of the eggs in the roe of fish: &#1502;&#1489;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1489; &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1509; &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;, when the white is outside and the yellow within.)<p>or in the slime of purslain (according to Chalmetho in the Peschito, Arab. h&#803;amqa&#770;), fatua  equals  purslain), which is less probable on account of &#1512;&#1497;&#1512; (slime, not: broth): there is no flavour so that it can be enjoyed. Thus is it with his sufferings. Those things which he before inwardly detested (dirt and dust of leprosy) are now sicut fastidiosa cibi mei, i.e., as loathsome food which he must eat. The first clause, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-7.htm">Job 6:7</a>, must be taken as an elliptic relative clause forming the subject: vid., Ges. 123, 3, c. Such disagreeable counsel is now like his unclean, disgusting diet. Eliphaz desires him to take them as agreeable. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; in &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; is taken by Ges. Ew., Hahn, Schlottm., Olsh. (165, b), as constr. from &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, sickness, filth; but &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, as plur. from &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;, sick, unclean (especially of female menstruation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>), as Heiligst. among modern commentators explains it, is far more suitable. Hitz. (as anonym. reviewer of Ewald's Job in the liter. Centralblatt) translates: they (my sufferings) are the morsels of my food; but the explanation of &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is not correct, nor is it necessary to go to the Arabic for an explanation of &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;. It is also unnecessary, with Bttcher, to read &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497; (such is my food in accordance with my disease); Job does not here speak of his diet as an invalid. </body></html>
