This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They were confounded because they had hoped - The caravans of Tema and Sheba. The word "confounded" here means ashamed. It represents the state of feeling which one has who has met with disappointment. He is perplexed, distressed, and ashamed that he had entertained so confident hope; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-5.htm">Isaiah 30:5</a>. They were downcast and sad that the waters had failed, and they looked on one another with confusion and dismay. There are few images more poetic than this, and nothing that would more strikingly exhibit the disappointment of Job, that he had looked for consolation from his friends, and had not found it. He was down-cast, distressed, and disheartened, like the travelers of Tema and of Sheba, because they had nothing to offer to console him; because he had waited for them to sustain him in his afflictions, and had been wholly disappointed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. literally, "each had hoped"; namely, that their companions would find water.

When they came to the places where they hoped to find water, finding none were ashamed of their vain hope, and reflected upon themselves for being so foolish as to raise their expectations upon such a groundless surmise: <p>they came thither, and were ashamed; which is the same thing expressed in different words; and aptly enough describes Job's disappointment in not meeting with that relief and comfort he expected from his friends, to whom he makes application of all this in the following words. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were confounded because they had hoped</span>. Shame and confusion of face came upon them in consequence of their  vain hope. In the same way, Job implies, he is ashamed of having looked for compassion and kindness from his friends. He should have been wiser and have known better. <span class="cmt_word">They came thither, and were ashamed</span>. They not only hoped, but acted on their hope-let it turn them aside from their way (ver. 18) and bring them to ruin. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14  To him who is consumed gentleness is due from his friend,<p>Otherwise he might forsake the fear of the Almighty.<p>15  My brothers are become false as a torrent,<p>As the bed of torrents which vanish away - <p>16  They were blackish from ice,<p>Snow is hidden in them - <p>17  In the time, when warmth cometh to them, they are destroyed.<p>It becometh hot, they are extinguished from their place.<p>Ewald supplies between <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a> two lines which have professedly fallen out ("from a brother sympathy is due to the oppressed of God, in order he may not succumb to excessive grief"). Hitzig strongly characterizes this interpolation as a "pure swindle." There is really nothing wanting; but we need not even take &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, with Hitz., in the signification reproach (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>): if reproach cometh to the sufferer from his friend, he forsaketh the fear of God. &#1502;&#1505; (from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, liquefieri) is one who is inwardly melted, the disheartened. Such an one should receive &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; from his friend, i.e., that he should restore him &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>). The waw (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>) is equivalent to alioqui with the future subjunctive (vid., Ges. 127, 5). Harshness might precipitate him into the abyss from which love will keep him back. So Schnurrer: Afflicto exhibenda est ab amico ipsius humanitas, alioqui hic reverentiam Dei exuit. Such harshness instead of charity meets him from his brothers, i.e., friends beloved as brothers. In vain he has looked to them for reviving consolation. Theirs is no comfort; it is like the dried-up water of a wady. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is a mountain or forest brook, which comes down from the height, and in spring is swollen by melting ice and the snow that thaws on the mountain-tops; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, i.e., a torrent swollen by winter water. The melting blocks of ice darken the water of such a wady, and the snow falling together is quickly hidden in its bosom (&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;). If they begin to be warmed (Pual &#1494;&#1512;&#1489;, cognate to &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>, aduri, and &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;, comburere), suddenly they are reduced to nothing (&#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514;, exstingui); they vanish away &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, when it becomes hot. The suffix is, with Ew., Olsh., and others, to be taken as neuter; not with Hirz., to be referred to a suppressed &#1488;&#1514;: when the season grows hot. job bewails the disappointment he has experienced, the "decline" of charity <p>(Note: Oetinger says that <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15-20</a> describe those who get "consumption" when they are obliged to extend "the breasts of compassion" to their neighbour.)<p>still further, by keeping to the figure of the mountain torrent. </body></html>
