Sheba, as understood here, was probably a district on the Arabian Gulf (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm" title="And the Sabeans fell on them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:15</a>), where merchants trafficked with the distant cities of the East, as well as enriched themselves with the plunder of their neighbours, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm" title="And the Sabeans fell on them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm" title="The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.">Job 6:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">The troops of Tema looked — </span>This place and Sheba were both parts of the hot and dry country of Arabia; in which waters were very scarce, and therefore precious and desirable, especially to travellers. The word <span class="greekheb">ארחות</span>, <span class="ital">orchoth, </span>signifies companies of travellers or merchants, such as that mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a>, <span class="ital">A company of the Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels, </span>&c., or those spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/21-13.htm" title="The burden on Arabia.

It must be observed, men did not there travel singly as we do, but in companies, for their security against wild beasts and robbers. “By a very slight alteration in the pointing, Mr. Heath so translates this verse as to introduce the speaker using a prosopopœia, or addressing himself to the travellers: <span class="ital">Look for them, ye troops of Tema, ye travellers of Sheba, expect them earnestly. </span>This gives great life to the poetry, and sets a very beautiful image before the eye: the travellers wasting their time, depending on those torrents for water; but, when they come hither, how great the disappointment!” — Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:14-30 In his prosperity Job formed great expectations from his friends, but now was disappointed. This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The troops of Tema looked - That is, looked for the streams of water. On the situation of Tema, see Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>. This was the country of Eliphaz, and the image would be well understood by him. The figure is one of exquisite beauty. It means that the caravans from Tema, in journeying through the desert, looked for those streams. They came with an expectation of finding the means of allaying their thirst. When they came there they were disappointed, for the waters had disappeared. Reiske, however, renders this, "Their tracks (the branchings of the flood) tend toward Tema;" - a translation which the Hebrew will bear, but the usual version is more correct, and is more elegant.<p>The companies of Sheba waited for them - The "Sheba" here referred to was probably in the southern part of Arabia; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>. The idea is, that the caravans from that part of Arabia came and looked for a supply of water, and were disappointed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. the troops&#8212;that is, "caravans."<p>Tema&#8212;north of Arabia-Deserta, near the Syrian desert; called from Tema son of Ishmael (Ge 25:15; Isa 21:14; Jer 25:23), still so called by the Arabs. Job 6:19, 20 give another picture of the mortification of disappointed hopes, namely, those of the caravans on the direct road, anxiously awaiting the return of their companions from the distant valley. The mention of the locality whence the caravans came gives living reality to the picture.<p>Sheba&#8212;refers here not to the marauders in North Arabia-Deserta (Job 1:15), but to the merchants (Eze 27:22) in the south, in Arabia-Felix or Yemen, "afar off" (Jer 6:20; Mt 12:42; Ge 10:28). Caravans are first mentioned in Ge 37:25; men needed to travel thus in companies across the desert, for defense against the roving robbers and for mutual accommodation.<p>The companies &#8230; waited for them&#8212;cannot refer to the caravans who had gone in quest of the waters; for Job 6:18 describes their utter destruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The troops, </span> as this word is used, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm" title="The burden on Arabia.

The Tema were an Arab tribe descended from Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>). They are generally conjoined with Dedan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>), another Arab tribe, noted for carry-lug on a caravan trade. Both tribes probably wandered, and occupied at different periods different portions of the desert. The name, Tema, may linger in the modern city and district of <span class="accented">Tayma</span> on the confines of Syria, and upon the pilgrim-route between Damascus and Mecca. The "troops of Tema" probably looked for the "caravans" of ver. 18 to arrive in their country; but they looked in vain. The desert had swallowed them up. <span class="cmt_word">The companies of Sheba waited for them</span>. (On "Sheba," see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  What is my strength, that I should wait,<p>And my end, that I should be patient?<p>12  Is my strength like the strength of stones?<p>Or is my flesh brazen?<p>13  Or am I then not utterly helpless,<p>And continuance is driven from me?<p>The meaning of the question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>); is: Is not my strength already so wasted away, and an unfortunate end so certain to me, that a long calm waiting is as impossible as it is useless? &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, to draw out the soul, is to extend and distribute the intensity of the emotion, to be forbearing, to be patient. The question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>) is followed by &#1488;&#1501;, usual in double questions: or is my strength stone, etc. &#1492;&#1488;&#1501;, which is so differently explained by commentators, is after all to be explained best from <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-28.htm">Numbers 17:28</a>, the only other passage in which it occurs. Here it is the same as &#1492; &#1488;&#1501;, and in Num. &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1501;: or is it not so: we shall perish quickly altogether? Thus we explain the passage before us. The interrogative &#1492; is also sometimes used elsewhere for &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-4.htm">Job 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a> (Ges. 153, 3); the additional &#1488;&#1501; stands per inversionem in the second instead of the first place: nonne an  equals  an nonne, annon: or is it not so: is not my help in me  equals  or am I not utterly helpless? Ewald explains differently (356, a), according to which &#1488;&#1501;, from the formula of an oath, is equivalent to &#1500;&#1488;. The meaning is the same. Continuance, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., power of endurance, reasonable prospect is driven away, frightened away from him, is lost for him. </body></html>
