This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To him that is afflicted - Margin, "melteth." The word here used (&#1502;&#1505;  ma&#770;s) is from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;  ma&#770;sas, to melt, flow down, waste away, and here means one who pines away, or is consumed under calamities. The design of this verse is, to reprove his friends for the little sympathy which they had shown for him. He had looked for consolation in his trials, and he had a right to expect it; but he says that he had met with just the opposite, and that his calamity was aggravated by the fact that they had dealt only in the language of severity.<p>Pity should be showed from his friend - Good renders this, "shame to the man who despiseth his friend." A great variety of interpretations have been proposed of the passage, but our translation has probably expressed the true sense. If there is any place where kindness should be shown, it is when a man is sinking under accumulated sorrows to the grave.<p>But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty - This may be either understood as referring to the language which Job says they had used of him - charging him with forsaking the fear of God, instead of consoling him; or it may mean that they had forsaken the fear of God in reproaching him, and in failing to comfort him; or it may mean that if such kindness were not shown to a friend in trial, he would be left to cast off the fear of God. This last interpretation is adopted by Noyes. Good supposes that it is designed to be a severe reproach of Eliphaz, for the course which he had pursued. It seems to me that this is probably the correct interpretation, and that the particle &#1493;  (v) here is used in an adversative sense, meaning that while it was an obvious dictate of piety to show kindness to a friend, Eliphaz had forgotten this obligation, and had indulged himself in a strain of remark which could not have been prompted by true religion. This sentiment he proceeds to illustrate by one of the most beautiful comparisons to be found in any language. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. pity&#8212;a proverb.

An "afflicted" man is an object of pity, one that is afflicted of God; either inwardly with a wounded spirit, with a sense of God's displeasure, with divine desertions, with the arrows of the Almighty sticking in him, the poison thereof drinking up his spirits; or outwardly with diseases of body, with want of the necessaries of life, with loss of near relations, as well as substance, which was Job's case; or afflicted by Satan, shot at, sifted and buffered by him, distressed by his temptations, suggestions, and solicitations; or afflicted by men, reproached and persecuted for righteousness sake: in all such cases and circumstances "pity" should be showed; which is an inward affection of the mind, a sympathy of spirit, a sensible feeling of the afflictions of others, and which is expressed by gestures, motions, and actions, as by visiting them in their affliction, speaking comfortably to them, and relieving their necessities according to ability, and as the case requires: and this may be expected from a "friend", and what the law of friendship requires, whether it be in a natural and civil sense, or in a religious and spiritual one; the union between friends being so near and close, that they are, as it were, one soul, as David and Jonathan were; and as the people of God, members of the same body are, so that if one suffers, all the rest do, or should suffer and sympathize with it: and though this duty is not always performed, at least as it should be, by natural and spiritual friends, yet this grace is always shown by God, our best of friends, who pities his children and by Christ, who is a friend that loves at all times, a brother born for adversity, and that sticks closer than any brother, and cannot but be touched with the feeling of the infirmities of his friends. The words may be rendered, "to him that is melted" (c); afflictions are like a furnace or refining pot for the melting of metals, and are called the furnace of afflictions: and saints are the metal, which are put into it; and afflictions also are the fire, of fiery trials, which heat and melt, and by which means the dross of sin and corruption is removed, and the graces of the spirit are tried and made the brighter; though here it rather signifies the melting of the heart like wax or water through the affliction, and denotes the anguish and distress, the trembling and fears, a person is in through it, being overwhelmed and borne down by it, which was Job's case: or "he that melts pity", or "whose pity melts", or "melts in pity to his friend, he forsakes" (d), &amp;c. that is, he that fails in pity, is destitute of compassion, and shuts up the bowels of it to his friend in distress, has not the fear of God before his eyes; and this sense makes Job himself to be the friend in affliction, and Eliphaz, and those with him, the persons that are deficient in their mercy, pity, and compassion. Some render the words (e), "should reproach be cast on him that is afflicted, as that he forsakes the fear of the Almighty?" the word for pity is so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>; and the reproach on Job was, that he had cast off the fear of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-6.htm">Job 4:6</a>. This grieved him most of all, and added to his affliction, and of which he complains as very cruel usage; and very cutting it was that he should be reckoned a man destitute of the fear of God, and that because he was afflicted by him; though rather the following words: <p>but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty, are a charge upon his friend Eliphaz for not showing pity to him in his affliction, which was tacitly forsaking the fear of God. Job here recriminates and retorts the charge of want of the fear of God on Eliphaz himself; for to show mercy to an afflicted friend is a religious act, a part of pure and undefiled religion, a branch of the fear of God; and he that neglects it is so far wanting in it, and acts contrary to his profession of God, of fear of him, and love to him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>; or "otherwise he forsakes", &amp;c. (f). <p>(c) "liquefacto", Vatablus, Mercerus, Beza; so Ben Gersom. (d) "Cujus liquescit benignitas", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, "qui misericordia erga amicum contabescit", Schultens. (e) Mercerus, Vatablus, so Ben Gersom. Some interpret it as a charge that he forsakes both mercy and the fear of the Lord; so R. Simeon Bar Tzemach, Sephorno, and Ben Melech.

Job’s sorrowful disappointment at the position taken up towards him by his three friends<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Job had freely expressed his misery in ch. 3, believing that the sympathies of his friends were entirely with him. He is<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a brother noble,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whose nature is so far from doing harms<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That he suspects none.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Lear</span>, i. 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And more sorrowful to him than any cold, critical words which they have uttered is the feeling that his friends have taken up such a position against him. This was what he had not looked for. And his disappointment is like that of the thirsty caravan that finds the long-looked-for waters dried up in the heat. Every emotion seems now to find a place in Job’s mind in succession. First, his disappointment, expressed in this beautiful figure, is mixed with the feeling how unworthy his friends’ conduct was. They had not acted to him as men do to one who is, as he describes himself, “despairing” and “losing hold of the fear of the Almighty.” Kindness is due to such a one, but they had turned against him from sheer feebleness of spirit, because they saw that his calamity was from God, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/6-14.htm" title="To him that is afflicted pity should be showed from his friend; but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty....">Job 6:14-21</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Second, this mixed sadness and contempt passes into sarcasm when he tells them that he could have understood their fear if he had asked anything from them—even one’s friends must not be put under that strain—but he sought only sympathy, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/6-22.htm" title="Did I say, Bring to me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?...">Job 6:22-23</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Third, this sarcasm then gives place to a direct appeal of great severity, in which he demands that they should shew him the sins at which they had indirectly hinted, and wonders at their superficial captiousness in fastening on the mere excited words of a man in despair; adding in terms of bitter invective that their disposition was so hard that they would cast lots for the orphan and make market of their own friend, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/6-24.htm" title="Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred....">Job 6:24-27</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Finally, he challenges them to seek the explanation of his afflictions on other principles than the supposition of his guiltiness, asking them whether, in asserting his innocence, he would lie in their faces, and if he was not able to say whether his calamities were deserved or not? <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/6-28.htm" title="Now therefore be content, look on me; for it is evident to you if I lie....">Job 6:28-30</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To him that is afflicted pity should be showed from his friend</span>. Job begins here the third head of his reply to Eliphaz, in which he attacks him and his companions. The first duty of a comforter  is to compassionate his afflicted friend, to condole with him, and show his sympathy with his sufferings. This is what every one looks for and expects as a matter of course. But Job has looked in vain. He has received no pity, no sympathy. Nothing has been offered him but arguments. And what arguments! How do they touch the point? How are they anything more than a venting of the speaker's own self-righteousness? Let them fairly consider his case, and point out to him where he has been blamable<span class="cmt_word">.

Hupfeld prefers to read &#1493;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; instead of &#1493;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-8.htm">Job 6:8</a>); but death, which he desires, he even indeed expects. This is just the paradox, that not life, but death, is his expectation. "Cut me off," i.e., my soul or my life, my thread of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>). The optative &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1502;&#1497; (Ges. 136, 1) is followed by optative futt., partly of the so-called jussive form, as &#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, velit (Hiph. from &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;, velle), and &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, solvat (Hiph. from &#1504;&#1514;&#1512;). In the phrase &#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, the stretching out of the hand is regarded as the loosening of what was hitherto bound. The conclusion begins with &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;, just like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>. But it is to be asked whether by consolation speedy death is to be understood, and the clause with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; gives the ground of his claim for the granting of the wish, - or whether he means that just this: not having disowned the words of the Holy One (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>., and &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; in the mouth of Balaam, the non-Israelitish prophet, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-16.htm">Numbers 24:16</a>), would be his consolation in the midst of death. With Hupfeld we decide in favour of the latter, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-50.htm">Psalm 119:50</a> in view: this consciousness of innocence is indeed throughout the whole book Job's shield and defence. If, however, &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; (with Kametz impurum) points towards &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, quod, etc., the clause &#1493;&#1488;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; is parenthetical. The cohortative is found thus parenthetical with a conjunctive sense also elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>). Accordingly: my comfort - I would exult, etc. - would be that I, etc. The meaning of &#1505;&#1500;&#1491;, tripudiare, is confirmed by the lxx &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, in connection with the Arabic s&#803;alada (of a galloping horse which stamps hard with its fore-feet), according to which the Targ. also translates &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (I will rejoice).<p>(Note: The primary meaning of &#1505;&#1500;&#1491;, according to the Arabic, is to be hard, then, to tread hard, firm, as in pulsanda tellus; whereas the poetry of the synagogue (Pijut) uses &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification to supplicate, and &#1505;&#1500;&#1491;, litany (not: hymn, as Zunz gives it); and the Mishna-talmudic &#1505;&#1500;&#1491; signifies to singe, burn one's self, and to draw back affrighted.)<p>For &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>.
