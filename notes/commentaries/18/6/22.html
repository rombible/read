This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Did I say, Bring unto me? - Job proceeds to state that their conduct in this had been greatly aggravated by the fact that they had come voluntarily. He had not asked them to come. He had desired no gift; no favor. He had not applied to them in any way or form for help. They had come of their own accord, and when they came they uttered only the language of severity and reproach. If he had asked them to aid him, the case would have been different. That would have given them some excuse for interposing in the case. But now the whole was gratuitous and unasked. He did not desire their interference, and he implies by these remarks that if they could say nothing that would console him, it would have been kindness in them to have said nothing.<p>Or, Give a reward for me of your substance? - That is, did I ask a present from you out of your property? I asked nothing. I have on no occasion asked you to interpose and aid me. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

Did either my former covetousness or my present necessity make me troublesome or chargeable to you?

Did I ask for your aid? No. I neither requested you to bring me anything for myself, nor to make a present to any one on my behalf; much less did I call upon you to deliver me out of the hand of my enemies, to chastize the Chaldeans and the men of Sheba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15, 17</a>), and recover. from them my property.

Hitzig strongly characterizes this interpolation as a "pure swindle." There is really nothing wanting; but we need not even take &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, with Hitz., in the signification reproach (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>): if reproach cometh to the sufferer from his friend, he forsaketh the fear of God. &#1502;&#1505; (from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, liquefieri) is one who is inwardly melted, the disheartened. Such an one should receive &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; from his friend, i.e., that he should restore him &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>). The waw (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>) is equivalent to alioqui with the future subjunctive (vid., Ges. 127, 5). Harshness might precipitate him into the abyss from which love will keep him back. So Schnurrer: Afflicto exhibenda est ab amico ipsius humanitas, alioqui hic reverentiam Dei exuit. Such harshness instead of charity meets him from his brothers, i.e., friends beloved as brothers. In vain he has looked to them for reviving consolation. Theirs is no comfort; it is like the dried-up water of a wady. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is a mountain or forest brook, which comes down from the height, and in spring is swollen by melting ice and the snow that thaws on the mountain-tops; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, i.e., a torrent swollen by winter water. The melting blocks of ice darken the water of such a wady, and the snow falling together is quickly hidden in its bosom (&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;). If they begin to be warmed (Pual &#1494;&#1512;&#1489;, cognate to &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>, aduri, and &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;, comburere), suddenly they are reduced to nothing (&#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514;, exstingui); they vanish away &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, when it becomes hot. The suffix is, with Ew., Olsh., and others, to be taken as neuter; not with Hirz., to be referred to a suppressed &#1488;&#1514;: when the season grows hot. job bewails the disappointment he has experienced, the "decline" of charity <p>(Note: Oetinger says that <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15-20</a> describe those who get "consumption" when they are obliged to extend "the breasts of compassion" to their neighbour.)<p>still further, by keeping to the figure of the mountain torrent. </body></html>
