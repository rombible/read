In addition to outward troubles, the inward sense of God's wrath took away all his courage and resolution. The feeling sense of the wrath of God is harder to bear than any outward afflictions. What then did the Saviour endure in the garden and on the cross, when he bare our sins, and his soul was made a sacrifice to Divine justice for us! Whatever burden of affliction, in body or estate, God is pleased to lay upon us, we may well submit to it as long as he continues to us the use of our reason, and the peace of our conscience; but if either of these is disturbed, our case is very pitiable. Job reflects upon his friends for their censures. He complains he had nothing offered for his relief, but what was in itself tasteless, loathsome, and burdensome.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O that my grief were thoroughly weighed - The word rendered "grief" here (&#1499;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;  ka&#8219;as&#769;) may mean either vexation, trouble, grief; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:23</a>; or it may mean anger; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-19.htm">Deuteronomy 32:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28</a>. It is rendered by the Septuagint here, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;  orge&#772; - anger; by Jerome, peccata - sins. The sense of the whole passage may either be, that Job wished his anger or his complaints to be laid in the balance with his calamity, to see if one was more weighty than the other - meaning that he had not complained unreasonably or unjustly (Rosenmuller); or that he wished that his afflictions might be put into one scale and the sands of the sea into another, and the one weighed against the other (Noyes); or simply, that he desired that his sorrows should be accurately estimated. This latter is, I think, the true sense of the passage. He supposed his friends had not understood and appreciated his sufferings; that they were disposed to blame him without understanding the extent of his sorrows, and he desires that they would estimate them aright before they condemned him. In particular, he seems to have supposed that Eliphaz had not done justice to the depth of his sorrows in the remarks which he had just made. The figure of weighing actions or sorrows, is not uncommon or unnatural. It means to take an exact estimate of their amount. So we speak of heavy calamities, of afflictions that crush us by their weight. etc.<p>Laid in the balances - Margin, "lifted up."

At the same time; that all my sorrows, griefs, and woes, were piled on the scales, and then weighed.

Or, "in weighing weighed" (u), most nicely and exactly weighed; that is, his grievous affliction, which caused so much grief of heart, and which had been shown in words and gestures; or his "wrath" and "anger" (w), as others render it: not his anger against Eliphaz, as Sephorno, but as before, meaning the same thing, his affliction; which either, as he understood, was the fruit and effect of the wrath and anger of God, who treated him as an enemy; or rather, that wrath, anger, and resentment raised in his own mind by those afflictive providences, and which broke out in hot and passionate expressions, and for which he was blamed as a foolish man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>; or else the "complaint" (x), the groans and moans he made under them; or the "impatience" (y) he was charged with in bearing of them; and now he wishes, and suggests, that if they were well weighed and considered by kind and judicious persons, men of moderation and temper, a great allowance would be made for them, and they would easily be excused; that is, if, together with his expressions of grief, anger, and impatience, his great afflictions, the cause of them, were but looked into, and carefully examined, as follows: <p>and my calamity laid in the balances together! that is, his affliction, which had a being, as the word signifies, as Aben Ezra observes, was not through the prepossessions of fear as before, nor merely in fancy as in many, or as exaggerated, and made greater than it is, which is often the case; but what was real and true, and matter of fact; it was what befell him, had happened to him, not by chance, but by the appointment and providence of God; and includes all his misfortunes, the loss of his cattle, servants, and children, and of his own health; and now to be added to them, the unkindness of his friends; and his desire is, that these might be taken up, and put together in the scales, and being put there, that the balances might be lifted up at once, and the true weight of them taken; and the meaning is, either that all his excessive grief, and passionate words, and extravagant and unwarrantable impatience, as they were judged, might be put into one scale, and all his afflictions in another, and then it would be seen which were heaviest, and what reason there was for the former, and what little reason there was to blame him on that account; or however, he might be excused, and not be bore hard upon, as he was; to this sense his words incline in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a>; or else by his grief and calamity he means the same thing, his grievous afflictions, which he would have put together in a pair of balances, and weighed against anything that was ever so heavy, and then they would appear to be as is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-3.htm">Job 6:3</a>; Job by all this seems desirous to have his case thoroughly canvassed, and his conduct thoroughly examined into, and to be well weighed and pondered in the scale of right reason and sound judgment, by men of equal and impartial characters; but he tacitly suggests that his friends were not such, and therefore wishes that some third person, or other persons, would undertake this affair. <p>(u)  "librando, libraretur", Cocceius, Schultens.

The whole of nature will be at peace with thee: the stones of the field, that they do not injure the fertility of thy fields; the wild beasts of the field, that they do not hurt thee and thy herds. The same promise that Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a>) utters in reference to the last days is here used individually. From this we see how deeply the Chokma had searched into the history of Paradise and the Fall. Since man, the appointed lord of the earth, has been tempted by a reptile, and has fallen by a tree, his relation to nature, and its relation to him, has been reversed: it is an incongruity, which is again as a whole put right (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;), as the false relation of man to God is put right. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; (which might also be adj.) is predicate: thou wilt learn (&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;, praet. consec. with accented ultima, as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-39.htm">Deuteronomy 4:39</a>, here with Tiphcha initiale s. anterius, which does not indicate the grammatical tone-syllable) that thy tent is peace, i.e., in a condition of contentment and peace on all sides. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24</a> is to be arranged: And when thou examinest thy household, then thou lackest nothing, goest not astray, i.e., thou findest everything, without missing anything, in the place where thou seekest it.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-25.htm">Job 5:25</a> reminds one of the Salomonic <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>. &#1510;&#1488;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; in the Old Testament is found only in Isaiah and the book of Job.

Referring to the verb &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;, Arabic qahila (qalhama), to be shrivelled up, very aged, it signifies the maturity of old age, - an idea which may be gained more easily if we connect &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; (to be completed), like &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; with &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (to be hard).<p>continued...</body></html>
