However exceptional Job’s trials, yet his language is the common language of all sufferers who think that relief, if it comes, must come through change of circumstances rather than in themselves in relation to circumstances. Thus Job looks forward to death as his only hope; whereas with God and in God there were many years of life and prosperity in store for him. So strong is this feeling in him, that he calls death the thing that he longs for, his hope or expectation. (Comp. Job 17, where even the hope that he had in death seems to have passed away and to have issued in blank hopelessness.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/6-8.htm" title="Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!...">Job 6:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">O that I might have my request! — </span>The thing which I so passionately desired, and which, notwithstanding all your vain words, and weak arguments, I still continue to desire, and beseech God to grant me. <span class="ital">The thing that I long for! </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">תקותי</span>, <span class="ital">tickvati, my hope </span>or expectation. <span class="ital">That it would please God to destroy me — </span>To end my days and calamities together: <span class="ital">that he would let loose his hand — </span>Which is now, as it were, bound up or restrained from giving me that deadly blow which I desire.

Mr. Peters has justly observed, that “these two verses, as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-11.htm" title="What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is my end, that I should prolong my life?">Job 6:11</a>, with many more that might be quoted to the same purpose, are utterly inconsistent with Job’s believing that God would restore him to his former happy state;” as Bishop Warburton contended, that he might lay a foundation for an interpretation of the noted passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:...">Job 19:25-27</a>, different from that commonly received, and might explain it, not of Job’s hope of immortality, but of his expectation of a restoration to temporal prosperity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:8-13 Job had desired death as the happy end of his miseries. For this, Eliphaz had reproved him, but he asks for it again with more vehemence than before. It was very rash to speak thus of God destroying him. Who, for one hour, could endure the wrath of the Almighty, if he let loose his hand against him? Let us rather say with David, O spare me a little. Job grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience, that he had been, in some degree, serviceable to the glory of God. Those who have grace in them, who have the evidence of it, and have it in exercise, have wisdom in them, which will be their help in the worst of times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Oh that I might have my request - To wit, death. This he desired as the end of his sorrows, either that he might be freed from them, or that he might be admitted to a happy world - or both.<p>Would grant me the thing that I long for - Margin, "My expectation." That is, death. He expected it; he looked out for it; he was impatient that the hour should come. This state of feeling is not uncommon - where sorrows become so accumulated and intense that a man desires to die. It is no evidence, however, of a preparation for death. The wicked are more frequently in this state than the righteous. They are overwhelmed with pain; they see no hope of deliverance from it and they impatiently wish that the end had come. They are stupid about the future world, and either suppose that the grave is the end of their being, or that in some undefinable way they will be made happy hereafter. The righteous, on the other hand, are willing to wait until God shall be pleased to release them, feeling that He has some good purpose in all that they endure, and that they do not suffer one pang too much. Such sometimes were Job's feelings; but here, as in some other instances, no one can doubt that he was betrayed into unjustifiable impatience under his sorrows, and that he expressed an improper wish to die. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. To desire death is no necessary proof of fitness for death. The ungodly sometimes desire it, so as to escape troubles, without thought of the hereafter. The godly desire it, in order to be with the Lord; but they patiently wait God's will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My request, </span> i.e. the thing which I have so passionately desired, and, notwithstanding all your vain words and weak arguments, do still justly continue to desire, to wit, death, as is expressed <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-9.htm" title="Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!">Job 6:9</a></span>, and more largely <span class="bld">Job 3</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And that I might have my request,....

So keenly does Job realize the loathsomeness of his sufferings that he forgets his defence and breaks out into a passionate cry for death, which he calls the thing that he longs for.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that I might have my request!</span> Here the second point is taken up. Eliphaz has threatened Job with death, representing it as the last and most terrible of punishments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9, 20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>). Job's reply is that there is nothing he desires so much as death. His primary wish would have been never to have been born (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-10</a>); next to that, he would have desired an early death - the earlier the more acceptable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11-19</a>). As both these have been denied him, what he now desires, and earnestly asks for, is a speedy demise. It is not as yet clear what he thinks death to be, or whether he has any hope beyond the grave. Putting aside all such considerations, he here simply balances death against such a life as he now leads, and must expect to lead, since his disease is incurable, and decides in favour of death. It is not only his desire, but his "request" to God, that death may come to him quickly. <span class="cmt_word">And that God would grant me the thing that I long for</span>; literally, <span class="accented">my expectation</span> or <span class="accented">wish</span>. The idea of taking his own life does not seem to have occurred to Job, as it would to a Greek (Plato, 'Phaedo,' &sect; 16) or a Roman (Pithy, 'Epist.,' 1:12). He is too genuine a child of nature, too simple and unsophisticated, for such a thought to occur, and, if it occurred, would be too religious to entertain it for a moment. Like Aristotle, he would feel the act to be cowardly (Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.,' 5, <span class="accented">sub fin.</span>); and, like Plato (<span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), he would view it as rebellion against the will of God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then began Job, and said: <p>  2  Oh that my vexation were but weighed,<p>And they would put my suffering in the balance against it!<p>  3  Then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:<p>Therefore my words are rash.<p>  4  The arrows of the Almighty are in me,<p>The burning poison whereof drinketh up my spirit;<p>The terrors of Eloah set themselves in array against me.<p>Vexation (&#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;) is what Eliphaz has reproached him with (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>). Job wishes that his vexation were placed in one scale and his &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (Keri &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;) in the other, and weighed together (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;).

Bttcher, without brachylogy: they cause me to arm myself, put one of necessity on the defensive, which does not suit the subject. The terrors of God strike down all defence. The wrath of God is irresistible. The sting of his suffering, however, is the wrath of God which his spirit drinks as a draught of poison (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>), and consequently wrings from him, even from his deepest soul, the thought that God is become his enemy: therefore his is an endless suffering, and therefore is it that he speaks so despondingly. </body></html>
