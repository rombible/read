This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, Deliver me out of the enemy's hand? - At no time have I called on you to rescue me from a foe.<p>Or, Redeem me? - That is, rescue me from the hand of robbers. The meaning is, that he was in no way beholden to them; he had never called on them for assistance; and there was therefore no claim which they could now have to afflict him further by their reflections. There seems to be something peevish in these remarks; and we need not attempt to justify the spirit which dictated them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. the mighty&#8212;the oppressor, or creditor, in whose power the debtor was [Umbreit].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Deliver me</span> by power and the force of your arms, as Abraham delivered Lot. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Redeem me</span> by price, or ransom. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Or, deliver me from the enemies' hand?....

Job had asked no such favour of them; he had not troubled them with any such suits, and therefore they had no reason to use him in the manner they did, as he apprehended; it would be soon enough to flout and fling at him when he applied to them for any relief. <p>(c)  "e manu tribulatoris, vel tribulationis", Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">hand of the mighty</span>] that is, the powerful robber, who held his captives to ransom.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand?</span> rather, <span class="accented">from the hand of the violent</span> man. <span class="cmt_word">Or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</span> literally, of the oppressor (see the Revised Version). Job had not called on his friends to do any of these things. He had not worn out their patience by asking now for this, and now for that. But he had expected their compassion, and this was denied him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14  To him who is consumed gentleness is due from his friend,<p>Otherwise he might forsake the fear of the Almighty.<p>15  My brothers are become false as a torrent,<p>As the bed of torrents which vanish away - <p>16  They were blackish from ice,<p>Snow is hidden in them - <p>17  In the time, when warmth cometh to them, they are destroyed.<p>It becometh hot, they are extinguished from their place.<p>Ewald supplies between <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a> two lines which have professedly fallen out ("from a brother sympathy is due to the oppressed of God, in order he may not succumb to excessive grief"). Hitzig strongly characterizes this interpolation as a "pure swindle." There is really nothing wanting; but we need not even take &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, with Hitz., in the signification reproach (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>): if reproach cometh to the sufferer from his friend, he forsaketh the fear of God. &#1502;&#1505; (from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, liquefieri) is one who is inwardly melted, the disheartened. Such an one should receive &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; from his friend, i.e., that he should restore him &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>). The waw (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>) is equivalent to alioqui with the future subjunctive (vid., Ges. 127, 5). Harshness might precipitate him into the abyss from which love will keep him back. So Schnurrer: Afflicto exhibenda est ab amico ipsius humanitas, alioqui hic reverentiam Dei exuit. Such harshness instead of charity meets him from his brothers, i.e., friends beloved as brothers. In vain he has looked to them for reviving consolation. Theirs is no comfort; it is like the dried-up water of a wady. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is a mountain or forest brook, which comes down from the height, and in spring is swollen by melting ice and the snow that thaws on the mountain-tops; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, i.e., a torrent swollen by winter water. The melting blocks of ice darken the water of such a wady, and the snow falling together is quickly hidden in its bosom (&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;). If they begin to be warmed (Pual &#1494;&#1512;&#1489;, cognate to &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>, aduri, and &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;, comburere), suddenly they are reduced to nothing (&#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514;, exstingui); they vanish away &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, when it becomes hot. The suffix is, with Ew., Olsh., and others, to be taken as neuter; not with Hirz., to be referred to a suppressed &#1488;&#1514;: when the season grows hot. job bewails the disappointment he has experienced, the "decline" of charity <p>(Note: Oetinger says that <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15-20</a> describe those who get "consumption" when they are obliged to extend "the breasts of compassion" to their neighbour.)<p>still further, by keeping to the figure of the mountain torrent. </body></html>
