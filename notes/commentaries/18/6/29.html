This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Return, I pray you - That is, return to the argument. Give your attention to it again. Perhaps he may have discerned a disposition in them to turn away from what he was saying, and to withdraw and leave him. Job expresses his belief that he could convince them; and he proposes more fully to state his views, if they would attend to him.<p>Let it not be iniquity - Let it not be considered as wrong thus to come back to the argument. Or, let it not be assumed that my sentiments are erroneous, and my heart evil. Job means, that it should not be taken for granted that he was a hypocrite; that he was conscious of sincerity, and that he was convinced that he could satisfy them of it if they would lend a listening ear. A similar sentiment he expresses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm">Job 19:28</a> :<p>But ye should say, Why persecute we him?<p>Seeing the root of the matter is found in me.<p>My righteousness is in it - Margin, that is, this matter. The sense is, "my complete vindication is in the argument which I propose to state. I am prepared to show that I am innocent." On that account, he wishes them to return and attend to what he proposed to say. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

From the ill opinion you have of me, and from your hard censures, and entertain other sentiments concerning me: or it may be, upon these words of Job his friends might be rising up as usual to take their leave of him, and break off conversation with him; and therefore he entreats they would return to their seats, and resume the debate, and give a friendly hearing of his case: <p>let it not be iniquity; either let it not be reckoned an iniquity to return and go on hearing his case; or he entreats that they would take care not to sin in their anger and resentment against him, nor go on to charge him with iniquity: or it may be rendered, "there is no iniquity" (h); that is, it should be found that there was no such iniquity in him as he was charged with; not that he was free from all sin, which no man is, but from that which his friends judged he was guilty of, hypocrisy: <p>yea, return again; he most earnestly importunes them to return and patiently hear him out: <p>my righteousness is in it; in the whole of this affair before them, and which was the matter of controversy between them; meaning, not his justifying righteousness before God, but the righteousness of his cause before men; he doubted not but, when things were thoroughly searched into, that his righteousness would be as clear as the light, and his judgment as the noonday; that he should appear to be a righteous man, and his cause a just one; and should stand acquitted and free from all charges and imputations. <p>(h)   "non erit iniquitas", Beza, Mercerus; "nulla", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">Return, I pray you</span>] The verse means,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Turn, I pray you, let there be no injustice;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Turn again, I say; my cause is righteous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word “turn” appears to mean not “begin anew,” but “adopt another course,” that is, proceed on other suppositions than that of my guiltiness, and seek another explanation of my calamities. Hence, he adds, let there be no injustice, or wrong, that is, on the part of his friends in imputing guilt to him. The phrase “my cause is righteous” means literally <span class="ital">my right is in it</span>, that is, is here, is present; in other words, I have a righteous cause. <span class="ital">In it</span> can hardly mean, in the matter under discussion, as if the meaning were: the question is one that concerns my rectitude.

The Targum, however, translates after the Chethib: ye are become as though ye had never been, i.e., nothingness. Now, since &#1500;&#1488;, Aramaic &#1500;&#1492;, can (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-32.htm">Daniel 4:32</a> shows) be used as a substantive (a not  equals  a null), and the thought: ye are become nothing, your friendship proves itself equal to null, suits the imagery just used, we decide in favour of the Chethib; then in the figure the &#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; corresponds most to this, and is also, therefore, not to be explained away. The lxx, Syr., Vulg., translate &#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1500;&#1493;: ye are become it (such deceitful brooks) to me. Ewald proposes to read &#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; &#1506;&#1514;&#1492; &#1499;&#1503; (comp. the explanation, Ges. 137, rem. 3), - a conjecture which puts aside all difficulty; but the sentence with &#1500;&#1488; commends itself as being bolder and more expressive. All the rest explains itself. It is remarkable that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a> the reading &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is also found, instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;: ye dreaded misfortune, and ye were then affrighted. &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is here, as an exception, properispomenon, according to Ges. 29, 3. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-10.htm">Proverbs 5:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-20.htm">Leviticus 26:20</a>, what one has obtained by putting forth one's strength, syn. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, outward strength. </body></html>
