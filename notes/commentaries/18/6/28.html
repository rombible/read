This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now, therefore, be content - Rosenmuller has better rendered this, "if it please you." The sense is, "if you are willing, look upon me." That is, "if you are disposed, you may take a careful view of me. Look me in the countenance. You can see for yourselves whether I am sincere or false. I am willing that my whole demeanor should be subjected to the utmost scrutiny."<p>For it is evident unto you if I lie - Margin, as in Hebrew before your face. That is, "you yourselves can see by my whole demeanor, by my sufferings, my patience, my manifest sincerity, that I am not playing the hypocrite." Conscious of sincerity, he believed that if they would look upon him, they would be convinced that he was a sincere and an upright man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. be content&#8212;rather, "be pleased to"&#8212;look.

Or, "may it now please you" (f); Job addresses them in a respectful manner, and entreats them they would be so kind as to look favourably on him, and entertain better thoughts of him; and give a fresh and friendly hearing of his case, when he doubted not he should be acquitted by them of the charge of iniquity, and that his cause would appear to be a righteous one: <p>look upon me: upon my countenance; and see if you can find any traces of fear and falsehood, of dishonesty and hypocrisy, of shame and blushing; and observe if there is not all the appearance of an honest mind, of a good conscience within, that has nothing to fear from the strictest examination; or look upon my body, covered all over with boils and ulcers, and see if there is not occasion for those expressions of grief, and those heavy complaints that I have made; or rather, look upon me with an eye of pity and compassion, with affection, favour, and benevolence, and not bear so hard upon me: <p>for it is evident unto you if I lie; or, it is "before your faces" (g); should I attempt to deceive you by telling you a parcel of lies, you would soon discern the falsehood in my countenance; you would easily find it out in my words, which would issue in my shame and confusion; I could not expect to go undetected by men of such sagacity and penetration; but I am not afraid of the most diligent scrutiny that can be made into my words and actions. <p>(f)  "sed nunc placeat vebis", Schmidt.

But this addition is unnecessary. What Job desires is that his friends would look him straight in the face. Then they would not be able to doubt him. They would see that he was telling the truth. <span class="cmt_word">For it is evident unto you if I lie</span>; rather, it <span class="accented">will be evident</span> unto you, etc. Others render the passage, "For surely I shall not lie to your face" (Schultens, Canon Cook, Revised Version). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  For now ye are become nothing;<p>You see misfortune, and are affrighted.<p>22  Have I then said, Give unto me,<p>And give a present for me from your substance,<p>23  And deliver me from the enemy's hand,<p>And redeem me from the hand of the tyrant?<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a>, the reading wavers between &#1500;&#1493; and &#1500;&#1488;, with the Keri &#1500;&#1493;; but &#1500;&#1493;, which is consequently the lectio recepta, gives no suitable meaning, only in a slight degree appropriate, as this: ye are become it, i.e., such a mountain brook; for &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; is not to be translated, with Stickel and others, estis, but facti estis. The Targum, however, translates after the Chethib: ye are become as though ye had never been, i.e., nothingness. Now, since &#1500;&#1488;, Aramaic &#1500;&#1492;, can (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-32.htm">Daniel 4:32</a> shows) be used as a substantive (a not  equals  a null), and the thought: ye are become nothing, your friendship proves itself equal to null, suits the imagery just used, we decide in favour of the Chethib; then in the figure the &#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; corresponds most to this, and is also, therefore, not to be explained away. The lxx, Syr., Vulg., translate &#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1500;&#1493;: ye are become it (such deceitful brooks) to me. Ewald proposes to read &#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; &#1506;&#1514;&#1492; &#1499;&#1503; (comp. the explanation, Ges. 137, rem. 3), - a conjecture which puts aside all difficulty; but the sentence with &#1500;&#1488; commends itself as being bolder and more expressive. All the rest explains itself. It is remarkable that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a> the reading &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is also found, instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;: ye dreaded misfortune, and ye were then affrighted. &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is here, as an exception, properispomenon, according to Ges. 29, 3. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-10.htm">Proverbs 5:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-20.htm">Leviticus 26:20</a>, what one has obtained by putting forth one's strength, syn. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, outward strength. </body></html>
