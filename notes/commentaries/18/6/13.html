The sense may be, “Is it not that I have no help in me, and wisdom is driven quite from me?” or yet again, “Is it because there is no help in me that therefore wisdom is driven far from me?” as is the case by your reproaches and insinuations. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm" title="For wrath kills the foolish man, and envy slays the silly one.">Job 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-27.htm" title="See this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know you it for your good.">Job 5:27</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-13.htm" title="Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?">Job 6:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Is not my help in me? — </span>Though I have no strength in my body, or outward man, yet I have some help and support within me, or in my inward man, even a consciousness of my sincerity toward God, notwithstanding all your bitter accusations and censures, as if I were a hypocrite and had no integrity in me, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-6.htm" title="Is not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the uprightness of your ways?">Job 4:6</a>. <span class="ital">And is wisdom driven quite from me? </span>— If I have no strength in my body, have I therefore no wisdom or judgment left in my soul? Am I therefore unable to judge of the vanity of thy discourse, and of the truth of my own case? Have I not common sense and discretion? Do not I know my own condition, and the nature and degree of my sufferings, better than thou dost? And am I not a better judge whether I have integrity or not than thou art? It may not be improper to observe here, that there is considerable difficulty in determining the precise sense of the Hebrew of this verse; and that, accordingly, different learned men have proposed different translations of it. Houbigant renders it, <span class="ital">Because my help is not at hand, is wisdom, therefore departed far from me? </span>Dr. Waterland reads it, <span class="ital">Is my help in me vain, and the substance quite gone from me? </span>And Heath, <span class="ital">Do not I find that I cannot in the least help myself, </span>and that strength is quite driven out of me? In justification of our translation, and of the interpretation given above, it may be sufficient to observe, that the same form of expression in the Hebrew is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-2.htm" title="Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinks, because there is no water, and dies for thirst.">Isaiah 50:2</a>, <span class="greekheb">האם אין בי כח</span>, <span class="ital">haim en bi choach, </span>and is translated, and according to the context must necessarily be translated, in a similar manner. <span class="ital">An vero, nulla </span>(<span class="ital">est</span>) <span class="ital">in me potestas? Is there no power in me? </span>(saith the Lord.) <span class="ital">or, Have I no power to deliver? </span>If, however, a different translation of the words be contended for, perhaps that mentioned by Poole, which is perfectly agreeable to the Hebrew, and admits of an easy explication, is preferable to any other that has been proposed; which is, <span class="ital">What, if I have not help in me, is wisdom driven quite from me? </span>That is, if I cannot help myself, if my outward condition be helpless and hopeless, as I confess it is, have I therefore lost my understanding? Cannot I judge whether it is more desirable for me to live or to die; whether I am sincere in my religion or not; whether your words have truth and weight in them; and whether you take the right method of dealing with me?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:8-13 Job had desired death as the happy end of his miseries. For this, Eliphaz had reproved him, but he asks for it again with more vehemence than before. It was very rash to speak thus of God destroying him. Who, for one hour, could endure the wrath of the Almighty, if he let loose his hand against him? Let us rather say with David, O spare me a little. Job grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience, that he had been, in some degree, serviceable to the glory of God. Those who have grace in them, who have the evidence of it, and have it in exercise, have wisdom in them, which will be their help in the worst of times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is not my help in me? - This would be better rendered in an affirmative manner, or as an exclamation. The interrogative form of the previous verses need not be continued in this. The sense is, "alas! there is no help in me!" That is, "I have no strength; I must give up under these sorrows in despair." So it is rendered by Jerome, Rosenmuller, Good, Noyes, and others.<p>And is wisdom quite driven from me? - This, also, should be read as an affirmation, "deliverance is driven from me." The word rendered wisdom (&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;  tu&#770;sh&#305;&#770;ya&#770;h) means properly a setting upright; then help, deliverance; and then purpose, enterprise; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>. Here it means that all hope of deliverance had fled, and that he was sinking in despair. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. Is not my help in me?&#8212;The interrogation is better omitted. "There is no help in me!" For "wisdom," "deliverance" is a better rendering. "And deliverance is driven quite from me."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Though I have no strength in my body, or outward man, yet I have some help and support within me, or in my inward man, even the conscience of my own innocency and piety, notwithstanding all your bitter accusations and censures, as if I had no integrity, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-6.htm" title="Is not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the uprightness of your ways?">Job 4:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is wisdom driven quite from me?</span> If I have no strength in my body, have I therefore no wisdom or judgment left in my soul?

Do not I know my own condition, and the nature and degree of my sufferings, better than thou dost? Am not I a better judge whether I have integrity or no than thou art? But this verse is rendered otherwise, and that very agreeably to the Hebrew words, <span class="ital">What if I have no help in me</span>, (i.e. if I cannot help myself, if my outward condition be helpless and hopeless, as I confess it is,) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">is wisdom driven quite from me?</span> Have I therefore lost my understanding and common reason? Cannot I judge whether it is more desirable for me to live or to die, whether I am a hypocrite or no, whether your words have truth and weight in them or no, whether you take the right method in dealing with me, whether you deal mercifully and sincerely with me, or no? Yet again, (because the construction and sense of these words is judged very difficult,) this verse may be joined with the following, and rendered thus, <span class="ital">What if there be no help in me</span>, (or, if I be not able to bear my miseries,)<span class="ital"> and if counsel be driven from me</span>, so that I know not what to do, or how to help or ease myself? or, <span class="ital">and subsistence</span>, or <span class="ital">power of subsisting</span>, <span class="ital">be driven</span> or <span class="ital">taken away from me</span>, so that I can neither help myself out of my troubles, nor subsist under them? yet <span class="ital">to the afflicted pity should be showed</span>, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Is my help in me?.... Or "my defence" (y), as some; is it not in my power to defend myself against the calumnies and reproaches cast upon me? it is; and, though one have no help in myself to bear my burdens, or extricate myself out of my difficulties, yet I have the testimony of a good conscience within me, that supports me; and I have the strength and force of reason and argument on my side, to defend me against all objectors: <p>and is wisdom driven from me? either sound doctrine, the law (z), or, rather, the Gospel, the wisdom of God in a mystery, revealed in the words of the Holy One before mentioned; or wisdom in the hidden part, the fear of God, which is wisdom, true grace in the heart, which, when once implanted, can never be driven out; or natural reason and understanding, of which he was not bereaved; for, though his body was thus sorely afflicted, he retained his reasoning and intellectual faculties. The words, in connection with the former, may be read, "what, if help is not with me, is wisdom also driven quite from me?" (a) does it follow, because I am not able to help myself out of this afflicted and distressed condition in which I am, that I am deprived of my reason? or be it that I am such a weak impotent creature, and even distracted, as you take me to be, should I not then rather be pitied than insulted? so some (b) connect the words following. <p>(y)  "defensio mea penes me", Junius et Tremellius, Piscator.

This verse reads something as follows,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Is not my help within me gone,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And recovery driven away from me?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Both clauses seem to refer to the exhaustion caused by his disease. He feels that all resource within himself and all possibility of recovery is gone. The word “recovery” is that used in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-12.htm" title="He disappoints the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.">Job 5:12</a>, “anything effectual” (see notes), and probably signifies substance, or powers of recovery. The word might also be applied, as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-6.htm" title="And that he would show you the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.">Job 11:6</a>, to a condition of the mind and signify mental resource, but this sense does not seem to suit the connexion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not my help in me?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Is it not that I have no help in me?</span> (Revised Version). Job feels that, instead of having exceptional strength of constitution to enable him to bear up against his exhausting malady, he is absolutely without strength. All his vital power is used up. There is no help in him. <span class="cmt_word">And is wisdom driven quite from me?</span> rather, I<span class="accented">s not soundness driven quite from me? Tushiyah</span> seems to mean here "strength of constitution" - that internal soundness which resists the inroads of disease, and sometimes triumphs over the most serious maladies. Whatever reserve of this kind he may have possessed by nature, it is now, Job feels, altogether lost and gone from him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  5  Doth the wild ass bray at fresh grass?<p>Or loweth an ox over good fodder?<p>  6  Is that which is tasteless eaten unsalted?<p>Or is there flavour in the white of an egg?<p>  7  That which my soul refused to touch,<p>The same is as my loathsome food.<p>The meaning of the first two figures is: He would not complain, if there were really no cause for it; of the two others: It is not to be expected that he should smile at his suffering, and enjoy it as delicate food. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; I have translated "over good fodder," for &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is mixed fodder of different kinds of grain, farrago. "Without salt" is virtually adjective to &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;, insipid, tasteless. What is without salt one does not relish, and there is no flavour in the slime of the yolk of an egg, i.e., the white of an egg (Targ.), <p>(Note: Saadia compares b. Aboda zara, 40, a, where it is given as a mark of the purity of the eggs in the roe of fish: &#1502;&#1489;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1489; &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1509; &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;, when the white is outside and the yellow within.)<p>or in the slime of purslain (according to Chalmetho in the Peschito, Arab. h&#803;amqa&#770;), fatua  equals  purslain), which is less probable on account of &#1512;&#1497;&#1512; (slime, not: broth): there is no flavour so that it can be enjoyed. Thus is it with his sufferings. Those things which he before inwardly detested (dirt and dust of leprosy) are now sicut fastidiosa cibi mei, i.e., as loathsome food which he must eat. The first clause, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-7.htm">Job 6:7</a>, must be taken as an elliptic relative clause forming the subject: vid., Ges. 123, 3, c. Such disagreeable counsel is now like his unclean, disgusting diet. Eliphaz desires him to take them as agreeable. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; in &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; is taken by Ges. Ew., Hahn, Schlottm., Olsh. (165, b), as constr. from &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, sickness, filth; but &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, as plur. from &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;, sick, unclean (especially of female menstruation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>), as Heiligst. among modern commentators explains it, is far more suitable. Hitz. (as anonym. reviewer of Ewald's Job in the liter. Centralblatt) translates: they (my sufferings) are the morsels of my food; but the explanation of &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is not correct, nor is it necessary to go to the Arabic for an explanation of &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;. It is also unnecessary, with Bttcher, to read &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497; (such is my food in accordance with my disease); Job does not here speak of his diet as an invalid. </body></html>
