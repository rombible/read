Do they not enjoy whatever they desire? To this purpose, he observes, is Sol. Jarchi’s comment. Most commentators, however, read the words without an interrogation, which is certainly more agreeable to the Hebrew text. And Poole, with Henry and several others, consider them as containing an answer to the foregoing questions, and a confutation of the ungodly opinion and practice mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/21-14.htm" title="Therefore they say to God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of your ways....">Job 21:14-15</a>, as if he had said, Wicked men have no reason to reject God, because of their prosperity, for their wealth is not <span class="ital">in their hand; </span>neither obtained nor kept by their own might, but only by God’s power and favour. Therefore I am far from approving their opinion, or following their course. “After the foregoing elegant description of the prosperity of some wicked men,” says Dr. Dodd, “Job proceeds, on the other hand, to confess what was likewise apparent in the ways of Providence, that some of them were as remarkably distinguished by their wretchedness, being exposed to the most dreadful evils and calamities. He knew that while he had been recounting the prosperity of the wicked, he had touched upon a tender point, to which his adversaries would be apt to give a wrong turn, as if he had been pleading the cause of iniquity. He therefore guards against their entertaining any idea of that kind, in this verse, in which he speaks to this purpose: ‘Do not imagine that because I say the wicked sometimes prosper, therefore, I believe their prosperity to be owing to themselves, or in their own hand or power. God forbid that I should give such a countenance to impiety! No; though they may thus presumptuously imagine with themselves, I am not of their opinion, nor yet of their society; <span class="ital">the counsel of the wicked is far from me — </span>I know that all the happiness that they can boast is merely by the will and sufferance of Almighty God, and that sometimes he is pleased to make them terrible examples of his justice.’” Of which he speaks in the following verses to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm" title="For what pleasure has he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the middle?">Job 21:21</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:7-16 Job says, Remarkable judgments are sometimes brought upon notorious sinners, but not always. Wherefore is it so? This is the day of God's patience; and, in some way or other, he makes use of the prosperity of the wicked to serve his own counsels, while it ripens them for ruin; but the chief reason is, because he will make it appear there is another world. These prospering sinners make light of God and religion, as if because they have so much of this world, they had no need to look after another. But religion is not a vain thing. If it be so to us, we may thank ourselves for resting on the outside of it. Job shows their folly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lo, their good is not in their hand - Schultens, Rosenmuller, and Noyes, suppose, I think, correctly, that this is to be understood ironically, or as referring to what "they" had maintained. "Lo! you say, that their good is not in their hand! They do not enjoy prosperity, do they? They are soon overwhelmed with calamity, are they? How often have I seen it otherwise! How often is it a fact that they continue to enjoy prosperity, and live and die in peace!" The common interpretation, which Prof. Lee has adopted, seems to me to be much less probable. According to that it means that "their prosperity was not brought about or preserved by their own power. It was by the power of God, and was under his control. An inscrutable Providence governs all things." But the true sense is, that Job is replying to the arguments which they had advanced, and one of those was, that whatever prosperity they had was not at all secure, but that in a moment it might be, and often was, wrested from them. Job maintains the contrary, and affirms that it was a somewhat unusual occurrence <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a>, that the wicked were plunged into sudden calamity. The phrase "in their hand" means "in their power," or under their control, and at their disposal.<p>The counsel of the wicked is far from me - Or, rather, "far be it from me!" Perhaps the meaning is this, "Do not misunderstand me. I maintain that the wicked are often prospered, and that God does not in this life deal with them according to their deserts. They have life, and health, and property. But do not suppose that I am their advocate. Far be it from me to defend them. Far from me be their counsels and their plans. I have no sympathy with them. But I maintain merely that your position is not correct that they are always subjected to calamity, and that the character of people can always be known by the dealings of Providence toward them." Or, it may mean, that he was not disposed to be united with them. They were, in fact, prospered; but though they were prospered, he wished to have no part in their plans and counsels. He would prefer a holy life with all the ills that might attend it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. not in their hand&#8212;but in the hand of God. This is Job's difficulty, that God who has sinners prosperity (good) in His hand should allow them to have it.<p>is&#8212;rather, "may the counsel of the wicked be far from me!" [Umbreit]. This naturally follows the sentiment of the first clause: Let me not hereby be thought to regard with aught but horror the ways of the wicked, however prosperous.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their good is not in their hand:</span> this seems to be an answer to the foregoing question, and a confutation of that ungodly opinion and practice, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-14.htm" title="Therefore they say to God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of your ways.">Job 21:14</a>,15</span>.

Though it is in their possession for the present, it is not in the power of their hands to keep, nor to carry it with them when they die; God, that gave it, can take it away when he pleases; and therefore it might be profitable to them to serve him and pray unto him: or "their good is not by their hand"; they do not obtain their happiness by their works, as in the Tigurine version; and to the same sense Mr. Broughton, <p>"lo, their wealth cometh not by their own power;'' <p>it is not got by their own industry, diligence, care, and labour; by their own wisdom, knowledge, understanding, and cunning; for riches are not always to men of understanding, but come from God, who gives them to whom he pleases, and can take them away again if he thinks fit; and therefore men are dependent upon him for what they have, and should be thankful to him, and serve him, and pray for the continuance of good things to them. Jarchi reads the words by way of interrogation and admiration, lo! is "not their good in their hand?" verily it is, especially in their own opinion; their hands are full of it; they want nothing of God; they see no need of praying to him; hence the above words, which Job expresses his disapprobation of: <p>the counsel of the wicked is far from me; the counsels of their hearts; the thoughts of their mind; the words of their mouth; the above impious sayings were such as were detested and abhorred by him; their sense and judgment of things, their choice from deliberate consultation with themselves, preferring temporal good to spiritual good, and earthly things to heavenly ones, outward wealth and riches to the knowledge, service, and worship of God, and communion with him; these were what he disliked; their course of life, which was according to this world, and Satan the god of it, their company and conversation, were such as he carefully shunned and avoided; he chose not to come into their assembly, or to have any fellowship with them; to walk in the counsel of the ungodly, or stand in the way of sinners, these things were an abomination to him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. This Job says to exculpate himself, and wipe off any calumny that might be cast upon him, as if by what he had said, concerning the outward prosperity of the wicked, that he was a patron and defender of them, and an advocate for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Lo, their good <i>is</i> not in their <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> hand: the counsel of the wicked <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> is far from me.</span><p>(h) It is not their own, but God only lends it to them.<p>(i) God keep me from their prosperity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. Finally Job adverts to the mystery: this prosperity of theirs does not depend upon themselves, it is not of their own making; it comes from another, from God. God prospers the wicked, and Job had elsewhere said that He mocked at the despair of the innocent, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-23.htm" title="If the whip slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.">Job 9:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the counsel of the wicked is far</span>] Or, perhaps, the counsel of the wicked <span class="bld">be</span> far from me! Having drawn in such attractive colours the prosperity of the wicked, a prosperity given from the hand of God, Job, even in the midst of his own misery, which is also from God, cannot refrain from repudiating their principles—far be from me the counsel (see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm" title="Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and shine on the counsel of the wicked?">Job 10:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm" title="The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.">Job 18:7</a>) of the wicked, cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-18.htm" title="Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.">Job 22:18</a>. The above seems the most simple and effective way of understanding this verse. Others take it as an objection of the three friends, which Job anticipates and answers; <span class="ital">Lo!</span> say ye, <span class="ital">their good is not in their own hand;</span> the meaning being that they cannot retain it, they have no certainty of tenure of it, it will speedily desert them (Hitzig). To this Job is then supposed to reply in the following verses: <span class="ital">How often, then, is it seen to desert them?</span> This gives a very good sense.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, their good is not in their hand</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their prosperity is not in their own power, not the result of their own efforts. God's providence is, at least, one element in it, since he exalts men and abases them, he casteth down and lifteth up. Hence it would seem to follow that they are his favourites. Shall Job therefore cast in his lot with them? No, he says, a thousand times, No! <span class="cmt_word">The counsel of the wicked is far from me</span>; or better, <span class="accented">be the counsel of the wicked far from me!</span> I will have nothing to do with it. I will cling to God. I will maintain my integrity. Satan had charged Job with serving God for the sake of temporal reward. Job had disproved the charge by still clinging to God, notwithstanding all his afflictions. Now he goes further, and declines to throw in his lot with the wicked, even although it should appear that the balance of prosperity is with them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Wherefore do the wicked live,<p>Become old, yea, become mighty in power?<p>  8  Their posterity is established before them about them,<p>And their offspring before their eyes.<p>  9  Their houses have peace without fear,<p>And the rod of Eloah cometh not upon them.<p>10  His (the evil-doer's) bull gendereth and faileth not;<p>His cow calveth easily, and casteth not her calf.<p>11  They let their little ones run about as a flock,<p>And their children jump about.<p>The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a> is the same as that which Jeremiah also puts forth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-1.htm">Job 12:1-3</a>. It is the antithesis of Zophar's thesis, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>, and seeks the reason of the fact established by experience which had also well-nigh proved the ruin of Asaph (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>:comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-13.htm">Malachi 3:13-15</a>), viz., that the ungodly, far from being overtaken by the punishment of their godlessness, continued in the enjoyment of life, that they attain to old age, and also a proportionately increasing power and wealth. The verb &#1506;&#1514;&#1511;, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-18.htm">Job 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm">Job 18:4</a> (comp. the Hiph. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-5.htm">Job 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-15.htm">Job 32:15</a>), we read in the signification promoveri, has here, like the Arabic &#8219;ataqa, &#8219;atuqa, the signification to become old, aetate provehi; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, to become strong in property, is a synonym of &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, to acquire constantly increasing possessions, used in a similar connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-12.htm">Psalm 73:12</a>. The first feature in the picture of the prosperity of the wicked, which the pang of being bereft of his own children brings home to Job, is that they are spared the same kind of loss: their posterity is established (&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, constitutus, elsewhere standing in readiness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>, here standing firm, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-2.htm">Psalm 93:2</a>) in their sight about them (so that they have to mourn neither their loss by death nor by separation from their home), and their offspring (&#1510;&#1488;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, a word common only to the undisputed as well as to the disputed prophecies of Isaiah and the book of Job) before their eyes; &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; must be carried over to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-8.htm">Job 21:8</a> as predicate: they are, without any loss, before their eyes. The description passes over from the children, the corner-stones of the house (vid., Ges. Thes., s.v. &#1489;&#1504;&#1492;), to the houses themselves. It is just as questionable here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-3.htm">Isaiah 41:3</a>, and elsewhere, whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is a subst.

Since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; are interchangeable, and are construed according to their genus, the former undoubtedly is intended of the male, not also epikoi'noos of the female (lxx &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;, Jerome, Saadia), as Rosenm., after Bochart, believes it must be taken, because `br is never said de mare feminam ineunte, but always de femina quae concipit. In reality, however, it is with &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; otherwise than with &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, whose Pael and Aphel certainly signify concipere (prop. transmittere sc. semen in a passive sense). On the other hand, &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, even in Kal, signifies to be impregnated (whence &#1506;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;, the embryo, and the biblical &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, like the extra-biblical &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, the produce of the land), the Pael consequently to impregnate, whence &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; (from the part. pass. &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;) impregnated (pregnant), the Ithpa. to be impregnated, as Rabb.

The reference of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; to the female animal everywhere assumed is incorrect; on the contrary, the bullock kept for breeding is the subject; but proceeding from this, that which is affirmed is certainly referred to the female animal. For &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; signifies to cast out, cast away; the Hiph. therefore: to cause to cast out; Rabb. in the specified signification: so to heat what has sucked in that which is unclean, that it gives it back or lets it go (&#1500;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1496; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1506;).
