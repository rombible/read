He reconciles this to the holiness and justice of God. Even while they prosper thus, they are light and worthless, of no account with God, or with wise men. In the height of their pomp and power, there is but a step between them and ruin. Job refers the difference Providence makes between one wicked man and another, into the wisdom of God. He is Judge of all the earth, and he will do right. So vast is the disproportion between time and eternity, that if hell be the lot of every sinner at last, it makes little difference if one goes singing thither, and another sighing. If one wicked man die in a palace, and another in a dungeon, the worm that dies not, and the fire that is not quenched, will be the same to them. Thus differences in this world are not worth perplexing ourselves about.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His breasts - Margin, "milk pails." The marginal translation is much the most correct, and it is difficult to understand why so improbable a statement has been introduced into our common version. But there has been great variety in the translation. The Vulgate renders it, Viscera ejus plena sunt adipe - "his viscera are full of fat." So the Septuagint, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ta engkata autou ple&#772;re&#772; steatos. The Syraic, "his sides;" Prof. Lee, "his bottles;" Noyes, "his sides;" Luther, "sein milkfass" - "his milk-pail;" Wemyss, "the stations of his cattle;" Good, "his sleek skin." In this variety of rendering, what hope is there of ascertaining the meaning of the word? It is not easy to account for this variety, though it is clear that Jerome and the Septuagint followed a different reading from the present, and instead of &#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;  &#8219;a&#774;t&#803;&#305;&#770;yna&#772;yv, they read &#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;  bat&#803;&#305;&#770;yna&#772;yv - from &#1489;&#1496;&#1503;  bet&#803;en - "the belly;" and that instead of the word &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;  cha&#770;la&#770;b as at present pointed, meaning "milk," they understood it as if it were pointed &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;  cheleb - meaning "fat" - the same letters, but different vowels.<p>The word which is rendered "breast" (&#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503;  &#8219;a&#774;t&#803;&#305;&#770;yn) occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Scriptures. It has become necessary, therefore, to seek its meaning in the ancient versions, and in the cognate languages. For a full examination of the word, the reader may consult Bochart, Hieroz. P. 1, Lib. ii. c. xliv., pp. 455, 458; or Rosenmuller, where the remarks of Bochart are abridged; or Lee on Job, "in loc." The Chaldee renders it &#1489;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;, "his breasts." So Junius et Tre. Piscator, and others. Among the rabbis, Moses Bar Nackman, Levi, and others, render it as denoting the breasts, or "mulctralia" - "milk-vessels," denoting, as some have supposed, "the lacteals." This idea would admirably suit the connection, but it is doubtful whether it can be maintained; and the presumption is, that it would be in advance of the knowledge of physiology in the times of Job. Aben Ezra explains it of the places where camels lie down to drink - an idea which is found in the Arabic, and which will well suit the connection.<p>According to this, the sense would be, that those places abounded with milk - that is, that he was prospered and happy. The Hebrew word &#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503;  &#8219;a&#774;t&#803;&#305;&#770;yn, as has been observed, occurs nowhere else. It is supposed to be derived from an obsolete root, the same as the Arabic "atana, to lie down around water, as cattle do;" and then the derivative denotes a place where cattle and flocks lie down around water; and then the passage would mean, "the resting places of his herds are full, or abound with milk." Yet the primary idea, according to Castell, Golius, and Lee, is that of saturating with water; softening, "scil." a skin with water, or dressing a skin, for the purpose of using it as a bottle. Perhaps the word was used with reference to the place where camels came to drink, because it was a place that was "saturated" with water, or that abounded with water. The Arabic verb, also, according to Castell, is used in the sense of freeing a skin from wool and hairs - a lana pilisve levari pellem - so that it might be dressed for use.<p>From this reference to a "skin" thus dressed, Prof. Lee supposes that the word here means "a bottle," arid that the sense is, that his bottles were full of milk; that is, that he had great prosperity and abundance. But it is very doubtful whether the word will bear this meaning, and whether it is ever used in this sense. In the instances adduced by Castell, Schultens, and even of Prof. Lee, of the use of the word, I find no one where it means "a skin," or denotes a bottle made of a skin. The application of the "verb" to a skin is only in the sense of saturating and dressing it. The leading idea in all the forms of the word, and its common use in Arabic, is "that of a place where cattle kneel down for the purpose of drinking," and then a place well watered, where a man might lead his camels and flocks to water. The noun would then come to mean a watering place - a place that would be of great value, and which a man who had large flocks and herds would greatly prize. The thought here is, therefore, that the places of this kind, in the possession of the man referred to, would abound with milk - that is, he would have abundance.<p>Are full of milk - Milk, butter and honey, are, in the Scriptures, the emblems of plenty and prosperity. Many of the versions, however, here render this "fat." The change is only in the pointing of the Hebrew word. But, if the interpretation above given be correct, then the word here means "milk."<p>And his bones are moistened with marrow - From the belief, that bones full of marrow are an indication of health and vigor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. breasts&#8212;rather, "skins," or "vessels" for fluids [Lee].

Rosenm., Ges., Vaih., and Carey transl. with lxx and Jer.

Schnurr. and Umbr. are nearer to the correct interpretation when they understand &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; like &#1508;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>, of lightning, as it were fiery strings cast down from above. If we call to mind in how many ways Bildad, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8-10</a>, has represented the end of the godless as a divinely decreed seizure, it is certainly the most natural, with Stick. and Hahn, to translate (as if it were Arabic h&#803;aba&#770;'ilin) "snares," to be understood after the idea, however, not of lightning, but generally of ensnaring destinies (e.g., &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>).<p>Both <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a> with its three members and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a> with two, are under the control of &#1499;&#1502;&#1492;. The figure of straw, or rather chopped straw (Arab. tibn, tabn), occurs only here. The figure of chaff is more frequent, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>. Job here puts in the form of a question what <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-6</a> maintains, being urged on by Zophar's false application and superficial comprehension of the truth expressed in the opening of the Psalter. What next follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a> is an objection of the friends in vindication of their thesis, which he anticipates and answers; perhaps the clause is to be spoken with an interrogative accent: Eloah will - so ye object - reserve his evil for his children? &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, not from &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, strength, wealth, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-10.htm">Job 20:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a>, but from &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, wickedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11</a>) and evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>), here (without making it clear which) of wickedness punishing itself by calamity, or of calamity which must come forth from the wickedness as a moral necessity comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>. That this is really the opinion of the friends: God punishes the guilt of the godless, if not in himself, at least in his children, is seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-10.htm">Job 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-4.htm">Job 5:4</a>. Job as little as Ezekiel, ch. 18, disputes the doctrine of retribution in itself, but that imperfect apprehension, which, in order that the necessary satisfaction may be rendered to divine justice, maintains a transfer of the punishment which is opposed to the very nature of personality and freedom: may He recompense him himself, &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, that he may feel it, i.e., repent (which would be in Arab. in a similar sense, faja'lamu; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-14.htm">Ezekiel 25:14</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a> continues in the same jussive forms; the &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; signifies destruction (prop. a thrust, blow), in which sense the Arab. caid (commonly: cunning) is also sometimes used. The primary signification of the root &#1499;&#1491;, Arab. kd, is to strike, push; from this, in the stems Arab. ka&#770;d, med. Wau and med. Je, Arab. kdd, kdkd, the most diversified turns and applications are developed; from it the signif. of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-11.htm">Job 41:11</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-23.htm">Job 39:23</a>, and according to Fleischer (vid., supra, pp. 388) also of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, are explained. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>, refers to the figure of the cup of the wrath of God which is worked out by Asaph, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>, and then by the prophets, and by the apocalyptic seer in the New Testament. The emphasis lies on the signs of the person in &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; (&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;. The rather may his own eyes see his ruin, may he himself have to drink of the divine wrath; for what is his interest (what interest has he) in his house after him? &#1502;&#1492; puts a question with a negative meaning (hence Arab. ma&#770; is directly used as non); &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, prop. inclination, corresponds exactly to the word "interest" (quid ejus interest), as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-3.htm">Job 22:3</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a> (following his own interest), without being weakened to the signification, affair, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, a meaning which does not occur in our poet or in Isaiah. J<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/21-21.htm">Obadiah 21:21</a> is added as a circumstantial clause to the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>: while the number of his own months ... , and the predicate, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a> (which see), is in the plur. per attractionem. Schnurr., Hirz., Umbr., and others explain: if the number of his months is drawn by lot, i.e., is run out; but &#1495;&#1510;&#1509; as v. denom. from &#1495;&#1509; morf, in the signification to shake up arrows as sticks for drawing lots (Arab. sahm, an arrow and a lot, just so Persian t&#305;&#770;r) in the helmet or elsewhere (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>), is foreign to the usage of the Hebrew language (for &#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>, signifies not those drawing lots, but the archers); besides, &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1509; (pass. &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1509;) would signify "to draw lots," not "to dispose of by lot," and "disposed of by lot" is an awkward metaphor for "run out." Cocceius also gives the choice of returning to &#1495;&#1510;&#1509;, &#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in connection with this derivation: calculati sive ad calculum, i.e., pleno numero egressi, which has still less ground. Better Ges., Ew., and others: if the number of his months is distributed, i.e., to him, so that he (this is the meaning according to Ew.) can at least enjoy his prosperity undisturbed within the limit of life appointed to him. By this interpretation one misses the &#1500;&#1493; which is wanting, and an interpretation which does not require it to be supplied is therefore to be preferred. All the divers significations of the verbs &#1495;&#1510;&#1509; (to divide, whence <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-27.htm">Proverbs 30:27</a>, &#1495;&#1510;&#1509;, forming divisions, i.e., in rank and file, denom. to shoot with the arrow, Talm. to distribute, to halve, to form a partition), &#1495;&#1510;&#1492; (to divide, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-20.htm">Job 40:20</a>; to divide in two equal parts), Arab. hs&#803;s&#803; (to divide, whence Arab. hs&#803;s&#803;ah, portio), and Arab. chs&#803;s&#803; (to separate, particularize) - to which, however, Arab. cht&#803;t&#803; (to draw, write), which Ew. compares here, does not belong - are referable to the primary signification scindere, to cut through, split (whence &#1495;&#1509;, an arrow, lxx <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-20.htm">1 Samuel 20:20</a>, &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;); accordingly the present passage is to be explained: when the number of his months is cut off (Hlgst., Hahn), or cut through, i.e., when a bound is set to the course of his life at which it ends (comp. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1506;, of the cutting off of the thread of life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>, Arab. s&#803;rm). <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-21.htm">Job 14:21</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>, are parallels to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>. Death is the end of all clear thought and perception. If therefore the godless receives the reward of his deeds, he should receive it not in his children, but in his own body during life. But this is the very thing that is too frequently found to be wanting. </body></html>
