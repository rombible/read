He reconciles this to the holiness and justice of God. Even while they prosper thus, they are light and worthless, of no account with God, or with wise men. In the height of their pomp and power, there is but a step between them and ruin. Job refers the difference Providence makes between one wicked man and another, into the wisdom of God. He is Judge of all the earth, and he will do right. So vast is the disproportion between time and eternity, that if hell be the lot of every sinner at last, it makes little difference if one goes singing thither, and another sighing. If one wicked man die in a palace, and another in a dungeon, the worm that dies not, and the fire that is not quenched, will be the same to them. Thus differences in this world are not worth perplexing ourselves about.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God layeth up his iniquity for his children - Margin, that is, "the punishment of iniquity." This is a reference evidently to the opinion which "they" had maintained. It may be rendered, "You say that God layeth up iniquity," etc. They had affirmed that not only did God, as a great law, punish the wicked in this life, but that the consequences of their sins passed over to their posterity; or, if "they" were not punished, yet the calamity would certainly come on their descendants; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-19.htm">Job 18:19-20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-10.htm">Job 20:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-28.htm">Job 20:28</a>. This is the objection which Job now adverts to. The statement of the objection, it seems to me, continues to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22</a>, where Job says, that no one can teach God knowledge, or prescribe to him what he should do, and then goes on to say, that the "fact" was far different from what they maintained; that there was no such exact distribution of punishments; but that one died in full strength, and another in the bitterness of his soul, and both laid down in the dust, together. This view seems to me to give better sense than any other interpretation which I have seen proposed.<p>He rewardeth him, and he shall know it - That is, you maintain that God will certainly reward him in this life, and that his dealings with him shall so exactly express the divine view of his conduct, that he shall certainly know what God thinks of his character.

Equally questionable is the friends' assertion that if the godless himself is not punished, the children are (Job 18:19; 20:10); and that God rewardeth him here for his iniquity, and that he shall know it to his cost.

This is a prevention of an objection which Job foresaw his friends would make, and therefore takes it up and answers to it; you will say, that, be it so, that the wicked are for the most part prosperous, and their prosperity continues; God does not punish them now for their sins in their own persons, yet he will punish them in their children, for whom he reserves the punishment of their iniquity: this way go many of the Jewish commentators (y), in which they are followed by many Christian interpreters (z); and, as it seems, very rightly; now this Job grants, that so it is, God takes notice of the iniquities of men, and lays them up in his mind, and puts them down in the book of his remembrance; he reserves the punishment of their iniquities for their children, iniquity being often put for the punishment of it; this is laid up among his stores of vengeance, and is treasured up against the day of wrath; and when they have filled up the measure of their father's sins by their own transgressions, the deserved punishment shall be inflicted, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; but this will not clear the case, nor support the notions and sentiments of Job's friends, who had all along given out, that wicked men are punished themselves as well as their children; and that, if they are at any time in prosperous circumstances, it is only for a little while; and therefore agreeably to such notions God should take other methods with them, not punish their children only, but themselves, as Job argues in answer to the objection in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>, <p>he rewarded him, and he shall know it; or "he should reward him, and he should know it" (a); and so the word "should" is to be put instead of "shall" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>, which directs to the true sense of these clauses: and the meaning of Job is, that according to the sentiments of his friends, God should reward a wicked man while he lives in his own body, and not in his posterity only; he should render to them a just recompence of reward of their evil works, the demerit of their sins; and in such a manner, that they should know it, be sensible of it, and feel it themselves, and perceive the evil of sin in the punishment of it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>. <p>(y) Nachmanides, Jarchi, Ben Gersom, Bar Tzemach.

A conceivable objection, and its answer by Job. The verses read,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>19.&emsp;&emsp;God (say ye) layeth up his iniquity for his children.—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>20.&emsp;&emsp;Let his own eyes see his destruction,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>21.&emsp;&emsp;For what concern hath he in his house after him,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>When the number of his months is cut off?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To his argument that the wicked suffer no calamities Job supposes that his friends may object, founding on the old doctrine of retribution, that if the man himself do not suffer, his children shall be visited for his iniquity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>); and his answer is, Let the man himself suffer. The expression “that he may know it” means “that he may feel it.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word “concern” means “pleasure” as A. V., but also, <span class="ital">interest in, care for</span>; so Coverdale, For what careth he what become of his household after his death? The phrase “when the number of his months is cut off” means, when his life is ended. The words might also mean, when the (full) number of his months is dealt out, distributed to himself—when his own life is prolonged to its full measure. But it is not necessary to regard the wicked man as so abandoned as to be destitute of interest in his children even in his life-time, and indifferent to their fate provided his own days be prolonged. Job’s objection to the doctrine that a man’s iniquity is visited on his children is that this is no punishment of the wicked man himself, for he hath no concern in or knowledge of his children’s fate after his death (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-21.htm" title="His sons come to honor, and he knows it not; and they are brought low, but he perceives it not of them.">Job 14:21</a>). From the Prophetic Books of this age it appears that the ancient doctrine of retribution, the doctrine that the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children’s teeth are set on edge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-2.htm" title="What mean you, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?">Ezekiel 18:2</a>), had begun to awaken questionings, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-29.htm" title="In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.">Jeremiah 31:29</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., and in this book such doubts are, naturally, brought to a point.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God layeth up his iniquity for his children</span>. Job supposes his opponents to make this answer to his arguments. "God," they may say, "punishes the wicked man in his children" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Job does not deny that he may do so, but suggests a better course in the next sentence. <span class="cmt_word">He rewardeth him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">let him recompense it on himself -</span> let him make the wicked man himself suffer, and then he shall know it.

For it is not the fnends who draw the picture of the lot of the punishment of the godless with the most terrible lines possible, who suggest the appearance of looking wishfully towards the godless, but Job, who paints the prosperity of the godless in such brilliant colours. On the other hand, both sides are agreed in referring prosperity and misfortune to God as final cause.
