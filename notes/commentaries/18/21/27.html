Turn to whom you will, you will find that the punishment of sinners is designed more for the other world than for this, Jude 1:14,15. The sinner is here supposed to live in a great deal of power. The sinner shall have a splendid funeral: a poor thing for any man to be proud of the prospect of. He shall have a stately monument. And a valley with springs of water to keep the turf green, was accounted an honourable burial place among eastern people; but such things are vain distinctions. Death closes his prosperity. It is but a poor encouragement to die, that others have died before us. That which makes a man die with true courage, is, with faith to remember that Jesus Christ died and was laid in the grave, not only before us, but for us. That He hath gone before us, and died for us, who is alive and liveth for us, is true consolation in the hour of death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, I know your thoughts - That is, "I see that you are not satisfied, and that you are disposed still to maintain your former position.

God only truly, really, and in fact, knows the thoughts of men; this is his peculiar prerogative, he only is the searcher of the hearts and the trier of the reins of the children of men. Christ, the eternal Logos, or Word, by his being a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, appears to be truly God. No man knows the things of a than, or the thoughts of his heart, but himself, and such to whomsoever he reveals them; but a wise and understanding man, a careful observer of men and things, may make some shrewd guesses at the thoughts of others, by hints and half words, or sentences expressed by them; by the show of their countenance, which is the index of the mind, and by the gestures and motions of their bodies; by these they may in a good measure judge whether they like or dislike, approve or, disapprove, of what is said to them: and thus Job knew the thoughts of his friends, that they were different from his, that the sentiments of their minds did not agree with his; and though he had so clearly proved his point, yet he saw by their looks and gestures that what he had said was not satisfactory to them; that they did not think it a sufficient confutation of their arguments, and a full answer to their objections: <p>and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me; that he was an hypocrite, a wicked man, guilty of crimes, and which they were devising to produce against him, and charge and load him with, as Eliphaz does in the following chapter; he knew they meant him in all that they had said concerning wicked men, and their afflictions, and what would be their portion at death, and after it; and though they did not name his name, they might as well have done it, since he was the man they struck at in all, particularly it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>.

Finally, still pursuing his argument, Job turns to the insinuations of his friends against himself, which lie under their descriptions of the fate of the wicked. He knows what they mean when they say, Where is the house of the prince? But their conclusions were against the testimony of those who had travelled far and seen much. These testified that the wicked man was preserved in the day of destruction; that he came to an honoured grave, and the clods of the valley lay softly on him; and that his example, so far from being shunned, was followed by the mass of men, as there were multitudes that preceded him in the way he walked.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices</span> (or, <span class="accented">surmisings</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>which ye wrongfully imagine against me</span>.

How seldom does what the friends preach to him come to pass, that the lamp of the wicked is put out (thus Bildad, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>), and their misfortune breaks in upon them (&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;, ingruit; thus Bildad, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a> : misfortune, &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;, prop. pressure of suffering, stands ready for his fall), that He distributes (comp. Zophar's "this is the portion of the wicked man," i.e., what is allotted to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-29.htm">Job 20:29</a>) snares in His wrath. Hirz., Ew., Schlottm., and others, translate &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, after the precedent of the Targ. (&#1506;&#1491;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, sortes), "lots," since they understand it, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>, of visitations of punishment allotted, and as it were measured out with a measuring-line; but that passage is to be translated, "the measuring-lines have fallen to me in pleasant places," and indeed &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; can signify the land that is allotted to one (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-5.htm">Joshua 17:5</a>); but the plural does not occur in that tropical sense, and if it were so intended here, &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; or &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; might at least be expected. Rosenm., Ges., Vaih., and Carey transl. with lxx and Jer. (&#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, dolores) "pains," but &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is the peculiar word for the writhings of those in travail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-3.htm">Job 39:3</a>), which is not suited here. Schnurr. and Umbr. are nearer to the correct interpretation when they understand &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; like &#1508;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>, of lightning, as it were fiery strings cast down from above. If we call to mind in how many ways Bildad, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8-10</a>, has represented the end of the godless as a divinely decreed seizure, it is certainly the most natural, with Stick. and Hahn, to translate (as if it were Arabic h&#803;aba&#770;'ilin) "snares," to be understood after the idea, however, not of lightning, but generally of ensnaring destinies (e.g., &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>).<p>Both <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a> with its three members and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a> with two, are under the control of &#1499;&#1502;&#1492;. The figure of straw, or rather chopped straw (Arab. tibn, tabn), occurs only here. The figure of chaff is more frequent, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>. Job here puts in the form of a question what <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-6</a> maintains, being urged on by Zophar's false application and superficial comprehension of the truth expressed in the opening of the Psalter. What next follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a> is an objection of the friends in vindication of their thesis, which he anticipates and answers; perhaps the clause is to be spoken with an interrogative accent: Eloah will - so ye object - reserve his evil for his children? &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, not from &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, strength, wealth, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-10.htm">Job 20:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a>, but from &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, wickedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11</a>) and evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>), here (without making it clear which) of wickedness punishing itself by calamity, or of calamity which must come forth from the wickedness as a moral necessity comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>. That this is really the opinion of the friends: God punishes the guilt of the godless, if not in himself, at least in his children, is seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-10.htm">Job 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-4.htm">Job 5:4</a>. Job as little as Ezekiel, ch. 18, disputes the doctrine of retribution in itself, but that imperfect apprehension, which, in order that the necessary satisfaction may be rendered to divine justice, maintains a transfer of the punishment which is opposed to the very nature of personality and freedom: may He recompense him himself, &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, that he may feel it, i.e., repent (which would be in Arab. in a similar sense, faja'lamu; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-14.htm">Ezekiel 25:14</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a> continues in the same jussive forms; the &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; signifies destruction (prop. a thrust, blow), in which sense the Arab. caid (commonly: cunning) is also sometimes used. The primary signification of the root &#1499;&#1491;, Arab. kd, is to strike, push; from this, in the stems Arab. ka&#770;d, med. Wau and med. Je, Arab. kdd, kdkd, the most diversified turns and applications are developed; from it the signif. of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-11.htm">Job 41:11</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-23.htm">Job 39:23</a>, and according to Fleischer (vid., supra, pp. 388) also of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, are explained. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>, refers to the figure of the cup of the wrath of God which is worked out by Asaph, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>, and then by the prophets, and by the apocalyptic seer in the New Testament. The emphasis lies on the signs of the person in &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; (&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;. The rather may his own eyes see his ruin, may he himself have to drink of the divine wrath; for what is his interest (what interest has he) in his house after him? &#1502;&#1492; puts a question with a negative meaning (hence Arab. ma&#770; is directly used as non); &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, prop. inclination, corresponds exactly to the word "interest" (quid ejus interest), as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-3.htm">Job 22:3</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a> (following his own interest), without being weakened to the signification, affair, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, a meaning which does not occur in our poet or in Isaiah. J<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/21-21.htm">Obadiah 21:21</a> is added as a circumstantial clause to the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>: while the number of his own months ... , and the predicate, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a> (which see), is in the plur. per attractionem. Schnurr., Hirz., Umbr., and others explain: if the number of his months is drawn by lot, i.e., is run out; but &#1495;&#1510;&#1509; as v. denom. from &#1495;&#1509; morf, in the signification to shake up arrows as sticks for drawing lots (Arab. sahm, an arrow and a lot, just so Persian t&#305;&#770;r) in the helmet or elsewhere (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>), is foreign to the usage of the Hebrew language (for &#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>, signifies not those drawing lots, but the archers); besides, &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1509; (pass. &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1509;) would signify "to draw lots," not "to dispose of by lot," and "disposed of by lot" is an awkward metaphor for "run out." Cocceius also gives the choice of returning to &#1495;&#1510;&#1509;, &#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in connection with this derivation: calculati sive ad calculum, i.e., pleno numero egressi, which has still less ground. Better Ges., Ew., and others: if the number of his months is distributed, i.e., to him, so that he (this is the meaning according to Ew.) can at least enjoy his prosperity undisturbed within the limit of life appointed to him. By this interpretation one misses the &#1500;&#1493; which is wanting, and an interpretation which does not require it to be supplied is therefore to be preferred. All the divers significations of the verbs &#1495;&#1510;&#1509; (to divide, whence <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-27.htm">Proverbs 30:27</a>, &#1495;&#1510;&#1509;, forming divisions, i.e., in rank and file, denom. to shoot with the arrow, Talm. to distribute, to halve, to form a partition), &#1495;&#1510;&#1492; (to divide, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-20.htm">Job 40:20</a>; to divide in two equal parts), Arab. hs&#803;s&#803; (to divide, whence Arab. hs&#803;s&#803;ah, portio), and Arab. chs&#803;s&#803; (to separate, particularize) - to which, however, Arab. cht&#803;t&#803; (to draw, write), which Ew. compares here, does not belong - are referable to the primary signification scindere, to cut through, split (whence &#1495;&#1509;, an arrow, lxx <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-20.htm">1 Samuel 20:20</a>, &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;); accordingly the present passage is to be explained: when the number of his months is cut off (Hlgst., Hahn), or cut through, i.e., when a bound is set to the course of his life at which it ends (comp. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1506;, of the cutting off of the thread of life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>, Arab. s&#803;rm). <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-21.htm">Job 14:21</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>, are parallels to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>. Death is the end of all clear thought and perception. If therefore the godless receives the reward of his deeds, he should receive it not in his children, but in his own body during life. But this is the very thing that is too frequently found to be wanting. </body></html>
