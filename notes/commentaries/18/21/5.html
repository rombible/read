Or "look at me" (n); not at his person, which was no lovely sight to behold, being covered with boils from head to foot, his flesh clothed with worms and clods of dust, his skin broken, yea, scarce any left; however, he was become a mere skeleton, reduced to skin and bone; but at his sorrows, and sufferings, and consider and contemplate them in their minds, and see if there was any sorrow like his, or anyone that suffered as he did, and in such pitiful circumstances; or that they would have a regard to his words, and well weigh what he had said, or was about to say, concerning his own case, or concerning the providences of God with respect to good and bad men, and especially the latter: <p>and be astonished; at what had befallen him, at his afflictions, being an innocent man, and not chargeable with any crime for which it could be thought that these came upon him; and at the different methods of Providence towards good men and bad men, the one being afflicted, and the other in prosperous circumstances, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-8.htm">Job 17:8</a>; <p>and lay your hand upon your mouth; and be silent, since such dispensations of Providence are unsearchable, and past finding out; and, as they are not to be accounted for, are not to be spoken against: and it would have been well if Job had taken the same advice himself, and had been still, and owned and acknowledged the sovereignty of God, and not opened his mouth in the manner he had done, and cursed the of his birth, and complained of hard treatment at the hand of God perhaps his sense may be, that he would have his friends be silent, and forbear drawing the characters of men from the outward dealings of God with them. This phrase is used of silence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-9.htm">Job 29:9</a>; thus Harpocrates, the god of silence with the Heathens, is always pictured with his hand to his mouth. <p>(n)  "respicite ad me", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Mark me, and be astonished, and lay <i>your</i> hand upon <i>your</i> <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> mouth.</span><p>(c) He charges them as though they were not able to comprehend his feeling of God's judgment, and exhorts them therefore to silence.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

Job is about to controvert Zophar's theory of the certain retribution that overtakes the wicked man in this life, and to maintain that, on the contrary, he usually prospers (vers. 7-18). Knowing that, in thus running counter to the general religious teaching, he will arouse much horror and indignation on the part of those who hear him, he prefaces his remarks with a notice that they will cause astonishment, and an acknowledgment that he himself cannot reflect upon the subject without a feeling of alarm and dismay. He thus hopes partially to disarm his opponents. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mark me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">look to me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "attend to me," <span class="cmt_word">for I am about to say something well worth attention</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And be astonished.

Harpocrates, the Egyptian god of silence, was often represented with his finger on his lips (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 362). The symbolism is almost universal. Job begs his auditors to "refrain their lips," and, however much astonished, to keep silence until he has concluded. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>26  All darkness is reserved for his treasured things,<p>A fire that is not blown upon devoureth him;<p>It feedeth upon what is left in his tent.<p>27  The heavens reveal his iniquity,<p>And the earth riseth up against him.<p>28  The produce of his house must vanish,<p>Flowing away in the day of God's wrath.<p>.   .   .   .   .   .<p>29 This is the lot of the wicked man from Elohim,<p>And the heritage decreed for him from God.<p>As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a> God's store of earthly goods for the children of men is called &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (&#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1503;), so here the stores laid up by man himself are called &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;.

By this translation &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495; is equivalent to &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, since attention is given to the gender of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; in the verb immediately connected with it, but it is left out of consideration in the verbs &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; which stand further form it, which Olshausen thinks doubtful; there are, however, not a few examples which may be adduced in favour of it, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>; comp. Ges. 147, rem. 1. Certainly the relative clause &#1500;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; may also be explained by supplying &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;: into which one has not blown, or that one has not blown on (Symm., Theod., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;): both renderings are possible, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-22.htm">Ezekiel 22:22</a>; but since the masc. &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; follows, having undoubtedly &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; as its subject, we can unhesitatingly take the Synallage gen. as beginning even with &#1504;&#1508;&#1495;.

Niph.) proposed by Olsh. on account of the change of gender, i.e., it is devoured, is to be rejected for the reason assigned in connection with &#1504;&#1508;&#1495;. The correct interpretation has been brought forward by Schultens.<p>It is not without reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18-19</a>, where Job has called upon earth and heaven as witnesses, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-27.htm">Job 20:27</a> Zophar continues: "the heavens reveal his guilt, and the earth rises against him;" heaven and earth bear witness to his being an abhorrence, not worthy of being borne by the earth and shone upon by the light of heaven; they testify this, since their powers from below and above vie with one another to get rid of him. &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is connected closely with &#1500;&#1493; (which has Lamed raphatum) by means of Mercha-Zinnorith, and under the influence of the law, according to which before a monosyllabic accented word the tone is drawn back from the last syllable of the preceding word to the penultima (Ew. 73, 3), is accented as Milel on account of the pause.<p>continued...</body></html>
