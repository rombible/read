Wherefore is it so? This is the day of God's patience; and, in some way or other, he makes use of the prosperity of the wicked to serve his own counsels, while it ripens them for ruin; but the chief reason is, because he will make it appear there is another world. These prospering sinners make light of God and religion, as if because they have so much of this world, they had no need to look after another. But religion is not a vain thing. If it be so to us, we may thank ourselves for resting on the outside of it. Job shows their folly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? - compare for similar expressions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>. The meaning here is, "What claim has the Almighty, or who is he, that we should be bound to obey and worship him? What authority has he over us? Why should we yield our will to his, and why submit to his claims?" This is the language of the human heart everywhere. Man seeks to deny the authority of God over him, and to feel that he has no claim to his service. He desires to be independent. He would cast off the claims of God. Forgetful that he made, and that he sustains him; regardless of his infinite perfections and of the fact that he is dependent on him every moment, he asks with contempt, what right God has to set up a dominion over him. Such is man - a creature of a day - dependent for every breath he draws on that Great Being, whose government and authority he so contemptuously disowns and rejects!<p>And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? - What advantage would it be to us should we worship him? Men still ask this question, or, if not openly asked, they "feel" the force of it in their hearts. Learn hence,<p>(1) That wicked people are influenced by a regard to "self" in the inquiry about God, and in meeting his claims. They do not ask what is "right," but what "advantage" will accrue to them.<p>(2) If they see no immediate benefit arising from worshipping God, they will not do it. Multitudes abstain from prayer, and from the house of God, because they cannot see how their self-interest would be promoted by it.<p>(3) Men "ought" to serve God, without respect to the immediate, selfish, and personal good that may follow to themselves. It is a good in itself to worship God. It is what is "right;" what the conscience says "ought" to be done yet<p>(4) It is not difficult to answer the question which the sinner puts. There is an advantage in calling upon God. There is<p>(a) the possibility of obtaining the pardon of sin by prayer - an immense and unspeakable "profit" to a dying and guilty man;<p>(b) a peace which this world cannot furnish - worth more than all that it costs to obtain it;<p>(c) support in trial in answer to prayer - in a world of suffering of more value than silver and gold;<p>(d) the salvation of friends in answer to prayer - an object that should be one of intense interest to those who love their friends:<p>(e) eternal life - the "profit" of which who can estimate? What are the few sacrifices which religion requires, compared with the infinite and immortal blessings which may be obtained by "asking" for them? 'Profit! ' What can be done by man that will be turned to so good an account as to pray? Where can man make so good an investment of time and strength as by calling on God to save his soul, and to bless his friends and the world? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

"Who is he" (t)? as some render it; or what is there in him, in his nature, in his excellencies and perfections, that should oblige us to serve him? One would think the attribute of "Almighty", they own and acknowledge, is sufficient to engage to it, since he is the lawgiver that is able to save and to destroy, even to destroy with an everlasting destruction, both body and soul in hell, who obey him not; but fulness of riches, power, and authority, swell the mind with pride, and put men on asking such questions, and running such lengths as these; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>. The question is full of atheism, and suggests there was nothing in God excellent or worthy of any regard, or on account of which he should be served and worshipped; as if he was a mere idol, which is nothing in the world; and that he was indeed nothing in it, neither did good nor evil, nor concerned himself with the affairs of men; had forsaken the earth, and took no notice of what was doing is it; at least, the question supposes that such think themselves under no obligations to serve him, and shows them to be sons of Belial, without a yoke; that they neither are nor can he subject to the law of God without his grace; they are not willing God should reign over them, nor to be obedient to his commands and ordinances; but are for freeing themselves from all obligations to him, and choose to serve various lusts and pleasures; be the vassals of sin and Satan, rather than be the worshippers of God: <p>and what profit should we have if we pray unto him? Prayer is one part of the service of God, and may be here put for the whole: this, as all the rest, is very disagreeable to a natural man, who, as he is biased entirely by profit and gain, thinks there is nothing to be got by religious exercises; he observing, that the worshippers of God, as to external things, fare worse than those who do not pray unto him, or do not serve and worship him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-14.htm">Malachi 3:14</a>; though there is much profit, and many things, and those most excellent and valuable, got by prayer; for whatsoever good men ask in prayer, believing, they receive, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>. The Targum is <p>"if we pray in his Word,'' <p>in the name of the essential Word, the Son of God; whereas to ask or pray in his name is the only way of succeeding; and such, who do ask in faith in his name, have what they ask for, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>. <p>(t) "quis est?"

They pretend to have no knowledge of God, no sense of his claims upon them, no internal consciousness that they are bound to worship and obey him. They are agnostics of a pronounced type, or at least they profess to be such. <span class="cmt_word">What profit, they ask,</span> <span class="cmt_word">should we have, if we pray to him?</span> Expediency is everything with them. Will serving God do them any good? Will it advance their worldly interests? Persuade them of that, and they will be willing to pay him, at any rate, a lip-service. But, having prospered so long and so greatly without making any religious profession, they see no reason to believe that they would prosper more if they made one. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Wherefore do the wicked live,<p>Become old, yea, become mighty in power?<p>  8  Their posterity is established before them about them,<p>And their offspring before their eyes.<p>  9  Their houses have peace without fear,<p>And the rod of Eloah cometh not upon them.<p>10  His (the evil-doer's) bull gendereth and faileth not;<p>His cow calveth easily, and casteth not her calf.<p>11  They let their little ones run about as a flock,<p>And their children jump about.<p>The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a> is the same as that which Jeremiah also puts forth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-1.htm">Job 12:1-3</a>. It is the antithesis of Zophar's thesis, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>, and seeks the reason of the fact established by experience which had also well-nigh proved the ruin of Asaph (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>:comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-13.htm">Malachi 3:13-15</a>), viz., that the ungodly, far from being overtaken by the punishment of their godlessness, continued in the enjoyment of life, that they attain to old age, and also a proportionately increasing power and wealth. The verb &#1506;&#1514;&#1511;, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-18.htm">Job 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm">Job 18:4</a> (comp. the Hiph. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-5.htm">Job 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-15.htm">Job 32:15</a>), we read in the signification promoveri, has here, like the Arabic &#8219;ataqa, &#8219;atuqa, the signification to become old, aetate provehi; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, to become strong in property, is a synonym of &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, to acquire constantly increasing possessions, used in a similar connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-12.htm">Psalm 73:12</a>. The first feature in the picture of the prosperity of the wicked, which the pang of being bereft of his own children brings home to Job, is that they are spared the same kind of loss: their posterity is established (&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, constitutus, elsewhere standing in readiness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>, here standing firm, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-2.htm">Psalm 93:2</a>) in their sight about them (so that they have to mourn neither their loss by death nor by separation from their home), and their offspring (&#1510;&#1488;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, a word common only to the undisputed as well as to the disputed prophecies of Isaiah and the book of Job) before their eyes; &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; must be carried over to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-8.htm">Job 21:8</a> as predicate: they are, without any loss, before their eyes. The description passes over from the children, the corner-stones of the house (vid., Ges. Thes., s.v. &#1489;&#1504;&#1492;), to the houses themselves. It is just as questionable here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-3.htm">Isaiah 41:3</a>, and elsewhere, whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is a subst. ( equals  &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;) or an adj.; the substantival rendering is at least equally admissible in such an elevated poetic speech, and the plur. subject &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, which, if the predicate were intended to be taken as an adj., leads one to expect &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, decides in its favour. On &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;, without (far from) terrifying misfortune, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a>, &#1502;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, without a bow, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a>. That which is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>, according to external appearance, is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a> referred to the final cause; Eloah's &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;, rod, with which He smites in punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-13.htm">Job 37:13</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24-26</a>, where &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496;, scourge, interchanges with it), is not over them, i.e., threatens and smites them not.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-10.htm">Job 21:10</a> comes specially to the state of the cattle, after the state of the household in general has been treated of. Since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; are interchangeable, and are construed according to their genus, the former undoubtedly is intended of the male, not also epikoi'noos of the female (lxx &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;, Jerome, Saadia), as Rosenm., after Bochart, believes it must be taken, because `br is never said de mare feminam ineunte, but always de femina quae concipit. In reality, however, it is with &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; otherwise than with &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, whose Pael and Aphel certainly signify concipere (prop. transmittere sc. semen in a passive sense). On the other hand, &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, even in Kal, signifies to be impregnated (whence &#1506;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;, the embryo, and the biblical &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, like the extra-biblical &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, the produce of the land), the Pael consequently to impregnate, whence &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; (from the part. pass. &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;) impregnated (pregnant), the Ithpa. to be impregnated, as Rabb. Pual &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, impregnated (by which &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514; also signifies pregnant, which would be hardly possible if &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; in this sexual sense were not radically distinct from &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;-&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;). Accordingly the Targ. translates &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; by &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503; (impraegnans), and Gecatilia translates &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; by Arab. fh&#803;lhm (admissarius eorum), after which nearly all Jewish expositors explain. This explanation also suits &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1500;, which lxx translates &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; (Jer. non abortivit), Symm. in a like sense &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;, Aq. &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;, Saad. la julziq. The reference of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; to the female animal everywhere assumed is incorrect; on the contrary, the bullock kept for breeding is the subject; but proceeding from this, that which is affirmed is certainly referred to the female animal. For &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; signifies to cast out, cast away; the Hiph. therefore: to cause to cast out; Rabb. in the specified signification: so to heat what has sucked in that which is unclean, that it gives it back or lets it go (&#1500;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1496; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1506;). Accordingly Raschi explains: "he injects not useless seed into her, which might come back and be again separated (&#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;) from her inward part, without impregnation taking place." What therefore &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; says positively, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; says negatively: neque efficit ut ejiciat.<p>(Note: The Aruch under &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, quotes a passage of the Tosefta: &#1502;&#1493;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1514;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1501; &#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, the cast away (Wrflinge) eggs (i.e., such as have fallen away from the hen from a stroke on the tail of some other cause, and which are not completely formed) are allowed as food; he may eat them who does not loathe them.)<p>It is then further, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>, said of the female animal which has been impregnated that she does not allow it to glide away, i.e., the fruit, therefore that she brings forth (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496; as &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;), and that she does not cause or suffer any untimely birth.<p>continued...</body></html>
