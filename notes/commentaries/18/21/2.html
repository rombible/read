The following oration or discourse he was about to deliver concerning the prosperity of wicked men; to which he desires their closest attention, that they might the better understand the force of his reasoning, the evidences and proof of fasts he should give; whereby, if their minds were open to conviction, they would clearly see their mistake, and that truth lay on his side: <p>and let this be your consolations; or "this shall be your consolations" (k); meaning, either that they would receive instruction and benefit by his discourse, which would yield them pleasure and comfort; and to an ingenuous mind, to be convinced of an error, to have mistakes rectified, and to get knowledge of the truth, it is a real satisfaction, and affords pleasure; or else, that whereas their end in paying him a visit was to comfort him, and they had taken methods, as they thought, in order to it, but in Job's opinion to very little purpose, yea, they were, as he says, miserable comforters; now he observes, that if they would but be silent, and attentively listen to what he had to say, that would be in the room of all comforts they could give unto him; it would be a consolation to him, and be reckoned by him, instead of all they could give, or could propose to him, if he might have but this favour, to be heard with candour, diligence, and attention. <p>(k)  "et hoc erit consolationes vestrae", Beza, Mercerus; so Jarchi; "idque pro consolatione vobis", Tigurine version; "pro consolationibus vestris", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hear diligently my speech, and let this <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> be your consolations.</span><p>(a) Your diligent marking of my words will be to me a great consolation.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">your consolations</span>] They believed they were offering him the consolations of God (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-11.htm" title="Are the consolations of God small with you? is there any secret thing with you?">Job 15:11</a>); the consolation he seeks from them is that they listen to him.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The two futt. may be arranged as in a conditional clause, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2-4</a>; and this is, as it seems, the mutual relation of the two expressions designed by the poet (similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-18.htm">Isaiah 24:18</a>): if he flee from the weapons of iron, i.e., the deadly weapon in the thick of the fight, he succumbs to that which is destructive by and by: the bow of brass (&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; poet. for &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>, although it might also be an adj., since eth, as the Arab. qaws shows, is really a feminine termination) will pierce him through (fut. Kal of &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, Arab. chlf, to press further and further, press after, here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>). The flight of the disheartened is a punishment which is completed by his being hit while fleeing by the arrow which the brazen bow sends with swift power after him. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-25.htm">Job 20:25</a> the Targ. reads &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468; with He mappic., and translates: he (the enemy, or God) draws (stringit), and it (the sword) comes out of its sheath, which is to be rejected because &#1490;&#1468;&#1493; cannot signify vagina. Kimchi and most Jewish expositors interpret &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492; by &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;; the lxx also translates it &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;. To understand it according to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493; (back), of the hinder part of the body, gives no suitable sense, since the evil-doer is imagined as hit in the back, the arrow consequently passing out at the front; <p>(Note: Thus sings the warrior Cana'an Tjr (died about 1815) after the loss of his wife: - <p>"My grief for her is the brief of him whose horse is dashed in pieces in the desert.<p>The way is wild, and there is no help from the travellers who have hurried on before.<p>My groaning is like the groaning of one who, mortally wounded between the shoulders,<p>Will flee, and trails after him the lance that is fastened in him."<p> - Wetzst.)<p>whereas the signification body is suitable, and is also made sufficiently certain by the cognate form &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1507;, however, is used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-22.htm">Judges 3:22</a> : he who is hit drawn the arrow out, then it comes out of his body, into which it is driven deep; and the glance, i.e., the metal head of the arrow (like &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-22.htm">Judges 3:22</a>, the point in distinction from the shaft), out of his gall (&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>, so called from its bitterness, as &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;, &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, comp. &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, from the green-yellow colour), since, as the Syriac version freely translates, his gall-bladder is burst.<p>(Note: Abulwalid (in Kimchi) understands the red gall, i.e., the gall-bladder, by &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, after the Arabic mara&#770;re. If this is pierced, its contents are emptied into the lower part of the body, and the man dies.)<p>Is &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, as a parallel word to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;, to be connected with &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;, or with what follows? The accentuation varies. The ordinary interpunction is &#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1511; with Dech, &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; Mercha, or more correctly Mercha-Zinnorith, &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; Rebia mugrasch (according to which, Ew., Umbr., Vaih., Welte, Hahn, Schlottm., and Olsh. divide); &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; is, however, also found with Athnach. Although the latter mode of accentuation is only feebly supported, we nevertheless consider it as the more correct, for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, in the mind of the poet, can hardly have formed a line of the verse. If, however, &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is now taken together, it is a matter for inquiry whether it is to be explained: he passes away, since terrors come upon him (Schult., Rosenm., Hirz., Von Gerl., Carey), or: terrors come upon him (lxx, Targ., Syr., Jer., Ramban). We consider the latter as the only correct interpretation; for if &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; ought to be understood after <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-20.htm">Job 14:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-22.htm">Job 16:22</a>, the poet would have expressed himself ambiguously, since it is at least as natural to consider &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; as the subject of &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, as to take &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; as an adverbial clause. The former, however, is both natural according to the syntax (vid., Ges. 147, a) and suitable in matter: terrors (i.e., of certain death to him in a short time) draw on upon him, and accordingly we decide in its favour. </body></html>
