This was, Whether outward prosperity is a mark of the true church, and the true members of it, so that ruin of a man's prosperity proves him a hypocrite? This they asserted, but Job denied. If they looked upon him, they might see misery enough to demand compassion, and their bold interpretations of this mysterious providence should be turned into silent wonder.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Suffer me that I may speak - Allow me to speak without interruption, or bear with me while I freely express my sentiments - it is all that I now ask.<p>And after that I have spoken, mock on - Resume your reproaches, if you will, when I am done. I ask only the privilege of expressing my thoughts on a very important point, and when that is done, I will allow you to resume your remarks as you have done before, and you may utter your sentiments without interruption. Or it may be, that Job utters this in a kind of triumph, and that he feels that what he was about to say was so important that it would end the "argument;" and that all they could say after that would be mere mockery and reviling. The word rendered "mock on" (&#1500;&#1506;&#1490;  la&#770;&#8219;ag) means, originally, "to stammer, to speak unintelligibly" - then, "to speak in a barbarous or foreign language" - then, "to deride or to mock, to ridicule or insult." The idea is, that they might mock his woes, and torture his feelings as they had done, if they would only allow him to express his sentiments. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. literally, "Begin your mockings" (Job 17:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Suffer me that I may speak</span> without such interruption as you have given me, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-2.htm" title="Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.">Job 20:2</a></span>; and if I do not defend my cause with solid and convincing arguments, go on in your scoffs if you please. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Suffer me that I may speak,....

There is an emphasis on the "I" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5db;&#x5d9;</span>). Job implies that his opponents are not allowing him his fair share of the argument, which is an accusation that can scarcely be justified. Since the dialogue opened, Job's speeches have occupied eleven chapters, those of his "comforters" seven only. But a controversialist who has much to say is apt to think that sufficient time is not allowed him. And after that I have spoken, mock on. Job does not hope to convince, or silence, or shame the other interlocutors. When he has said his say, all that he expects is mockery and derision. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>26  All darkness is reserved for his treasured things,<p>A fire that is not blown upon devoureth him;<p>It feedeth upon what is left in his tent.<p>27  The heavens reveal his iniquity,<p>And the earth riseth up against him.<p>28  The produce of his house must vanish,<p>Flowing away in the day of God's wrath.<p>.   .   .   .   .   .<p>29 This is the lot of the wicked man from Elohim,<p>And the heritage decreed for him from God.<p>As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a> God's store of earthly goods for the children of men is called &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (&#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1503;), so here the stores laid up by man himself are called &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;. Total darkness, which will finally destroy them, is decreed by God against these stores of the godless, which are brought together not as coming from the hand of God, but covetously, and regardless of Him.

The &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; which follows is regarded by Ges. as Piel instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, but such a resolving of the characteristic sharpened syllable of Piel is unsupportable; by Hirz., Olsh. 250, b, and Pual instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, but &#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; signifies to be eaten, not (so that it might be connected with an accusative of the obj.) to get to eat; by Ew., Hupf., as Kal for &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, which is possible both from the letters and the matter (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-20.htm">Psalm 94:20</a>); but more correctly it is regarded as Poel, for such Poel forms from strong roots do occur, as &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>), and that the Cholem of these forms can be shortened into Kametz-chatuph is seen from &#1493;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a> (vid., Psalter in loc.).<p>(Note: Such a contraction is also presented in the readings &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a>; &#1502;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a>; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>. All these forms are not resolved forms of Piel (Ges., Berth., Olsh. 248, a), but contracted forms of Poel with Kametz-chatuph instead of Cholem. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-9.htm">Job 13:9</a>, is not a resolved form of Piel, but a non-syncopated Hiphil.

By this translation &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495; is equivalent to &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, since attention is given to the gender of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; in the verb immediately connected with it, but it is left out of consideration in the verbs &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; which stand further form it, which Olshausen thinks doubtful; there are, however, not a few examples which may be adduced in favour of it, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>; comp. Ges. 147, rem. 1. Certainly the relative clause &#1500;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; may also be explained by supplying &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;: into which one has not blown, or that one has not blown on (Symm., Theod., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;): both renderings are possible, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-22.htm">Ezekiel 22:22</a>; but since the masc. &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; follows, having undoubtedly &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; as its subject, we can unhesitatingly take the Synallage gen. as beginning even with &#1504;&#1508;&#1495;. A fire which needs no human help for its kindling and its maintenance is intended (comp. on &#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a>); therefore "fire of God," <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>.

Kal; the form of writing &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; (fut. apoc. Niph.) proposed by Olsh. on account of the change of gender, i.e., it is devoured, is to be rejected for the reason assigned in connection with &#1504;&#1508;&#1495;. The correct interpretation has been brought forward by Schultens.<p>It is not without reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18-19</a>, where Job has called upon earth and heaven as witnesses, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-27.htm">Job 20:27</a> Zophar continues: "the heavens reveal his guilt, and the earth rises against him;" heaven and earth bear witness to his being an abhorrence, not worthy of being borne by the earth and shone upon by the light of heaven; they testify this, since their powers from below and above vie with one another to get rid of him. &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is connected closely with &#1500;&#1493; (which has Lamed raphatum) by means of Mercha-Zinnorith, and under the influence of the law, according to which before a monosyllabic accented word the tone is drawn back from the last syllable of the preceding word to the penultima (Ew. 73, 3), is accented as Milel on account of the pause.<p>continued...</body></html>
