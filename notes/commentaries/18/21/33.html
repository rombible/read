Turn to whom you will, you will find that the punishment of sinners is designed more for the other world than for this, Jude 1:14,15. The sinner is here supposed to live in a great deal of power. The sinner shall have a splendid funeral: a poor thing for any man to be proud of the prospect of. He shall have a stately monument. And a valley with springs of water to keep the turf green, was accounted an honourable burial place among eastern people; but such things are vain distinctions. Death closes his prosperity. It is but a poor encouragement to die, that others have died before us. That which makes a man die with true courage, is, with faith to remember that Jesus Christ died and was laid in the grave, not only before us, but for us. That He hath gone before us, and died for us, who is alive and liveth for us, is true consolation in the hour of death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him - That is, he shall lie as calmly as others in the grave. The language here is taken from that delusion of which we all partake when we reflect on death. We think of "ourselves" in the grave, and it is almost impossible to divest our minds of the idea, that we shall be conscious there, and be capable of understanding our condition. The idea here is, that the person who was thus buried, might be sensible of the quiet of his abode, and enjoy, in some measure, the honors of the beautiful or splendid tomb, in which he was buried, and the anxious care of his friends. So we "think" of our friends, though we do not often "express" it. The dear child that is placed in the dark vault, or that is covered up in the ground - we feel as if we could not have him there. We insensibly shudder, as if "he" might be conscious of the darkness and chilliness, and "a part" of our trial arises from this delusion. So felt the American savage - expressing the emotions of the heart, which, in other cases, are often concealed. "At the bottom of a grave, the melting snows had left a little water; and the sight of it chilled and saddened his imagination. 'You have no compassion for my poor brother' - such was the reproach of an Algonquin - 'the air is pleasant, and the sun so cheering, and yet you do not remove the snow from the grave, to warm him a little,' and he knew no contentment until it was done." - Bancroft's History, U. S. iii. 294, 295. The same feeling is expressed by Fingal over the grave of Gaul:<p>Prepare, ye children of musical strings,<p>The bed of Gaul, and his sun-beam by him;<p>Where may be seen his resting place from afar<p>Which branches high overshadow,<p>Under the wing of the oak of greenest flourish,<p>Of quickest growth, and most durable form,<p>Which will shoot forth its leaves to the breeze of the shower,<p>While the heath around is still withered.<p>Its leaves, from the extremity of the land,<p>Shall be seen by the birds in Summer;<p>And each bird shall perch, as it arrives,<p>On a sprig of its verdant branch;<p>Gaul in this mist shall hear the cheerful note,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33.

Some explain this of the lengthy funeral procession which follows his corpse to the grave, and take the next clause of the multitude, not forming  part of the procession, who gather together at the tomb beforehand, waiting to see the obsequies; but, as Rosenmuller remarks, this explanation seems precluded by the previous mention of the funeral procession (ver 32), besides being otherwise unsatisfactory. The real reference is probably to the common topic of consolation implied in the "Omnes eodem cogimur" of Horace. He is happy in his death, or at any rate not unhappy, seeing that he only suffers the common fate. He will draw after him all future men, who will likewise inevitably perish, just as there are innumerable before him, who have travelled the same read and reached the same resting-place. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>27  Behold I know your thoughts<p>And the stratagems, with which ye overpower me!<p>28  When ye say: Where is the house of the tyrant,<p>And where the pavilions of the wicked - :<p>29  Have ye not asked those who travel,<p>Their memorable things ye could surely not disown:<p>30  That the wicked was spared in the day of calamity,<p>In the day of the outburst of wrath they were led away.<p>31  Who liketh to declare to him his way to his face?<p>And hath he done aught, who will recompense it to him?<p>Their thoughts which he sees through, are their secret thoughts that he is such an evil-doer reaping the reward of his deeds. &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (which occurs both of right measures, good wise designs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-12.htm">Proverbs 8:12</a>, and of artful devices, malicious intrigues, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-17.htm">Proverbs 14:17</a>, comp. the definition of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-8.htm">Proverbs 24:8</a>) is the name he gives to the delicately developed reasoning with which they attack him; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; (comp.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, which is the antecedent to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-29.htm">Job 21:29</a>, beginning with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm">Job 19:28</a>), he refers to words of the friends like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-22.htm">Job 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-15.htm">Job 18:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>. &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489; is prop. the noble man, whose heart impels (&#1504;&#1491;&#1489;, Arab. nadaba) him to what is good, or who is ready and willing, and does spontaneously that which is good (Arab. naduba), vid., Psychol. S. 165; then, however, since the notion takes the reverse way of generosus, the noble man (princely) by birth and station, with which the secondary notion of pride and abuse of power, therefore of a despot or tyrant, is easily as here (parall. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, comp. &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, with the same word in the parallel) combined (just so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>, and similarly at least above, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-21.htm">Job 12:21</a>, - an anomaly of name and conduct, which will be for the future put aside, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-5.htm">Isaiah 32:5</a>). It is not admissible to understand the double question as antithetical, with Wolfson, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-11.htm">Proverbs 14:11</a>; for the interrogative &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is not appropriate to the house of the &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;, in the proper sense of the word. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is not an externally but internally multiplying plur.; perhaps the poet by byt intends a palace in the city, and by &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; a tent among the wandering tribes, rendered prominent by its spaciousness and the splendour of the establishment.<p>(Note: Although the tents regularly consist of two divisions, one for the men and another for the women, the translation "magnificent pavilion" (Prachtgezelt), disputed by Hirz., is perfectly correct; for even in the present day a Beduin, as he approaches an encampment, knows the tent of the sheikh immediately: it is denoted by its size, often also by the lances planted at the door, and also, as is easily imagined, by the rich arrangement of cushions and carpets. Vid., Layard's New Discoveries, pp. 261 and 171.)<p>Job thinks the friends reason a priori since they inquire thus; the permanent fact of experience is quite different, as they can learn from &#1506;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, travellers, i.e., here: people who have travelled much, and therefore are well acquainted with the stories of human destinies. The Piel &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, proceeding from the radical meaning to gaze fixedly, is an enantio'seemon, since it signifies both to have regard to, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>, and to disown, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>; here it is to be translated: their &#1488;&#1514;&#1514; ye cannot nevertheless deny, ignore (as Arab. nakira and ankara). &#1488;&#1514;&#1514; are tokens, here: remarkable things, and indeed the remarkable histories related by them; Arab. a&#770;yatun (collective plur. a&#770;yun), signs, is also similarly used in the signification of Arab. &#8219;ibrat, example, historical teaching.<p>That the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, introduces the view of the friends, and is the antecedent clause to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-31.htm">Job 21:31</a> : quod (si) vos dicitis, in tempora cladis per iram divinam immissae servari et nescium futuri velut pecudem eo deduci improbum (Bttcher, de fin. 76), has in the double &#1500; an apparent support, which is not to be denied, especially in regard to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-23.htm">Job 38:23</a>; it is, however, on account of the omission of the indispensable &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493; in this instance, an explanation which does violence to the words. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, on the contrary, introduces that which the accounts of the travellers affirm. Further, the &#1500; in &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; indicates here not the terminus ad quem, but as in &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, in the evening, the terminus quo. And the verb &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;, cohibere, signifies here to hold back from danger, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-18.htm">Job 33:18</a>, therefore to preserve uninjured. Ew. translates <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a> erroneously: "in the day when the floods of wrath come on." How tame would this &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, "to be led near," be!

At the time, when streams of wrath (&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;, the overflowing of vexation  equals  outburst of wrath, like the Arab. &#8219;abrt, the overflowing of the eye  equals  tears) go forth, they remain untouched: they escape them, as being under a special, higher protection.<p>continued...</body></html>
