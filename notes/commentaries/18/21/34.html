Turn to whom you will, you will find that the punishment of sinners is designed more for the other world than for this, Jude 1:14,15. The sinner is here supposed to live in a great deal of power. The sinner shall have a splendid funeral: a poor thing for any man to be proud of the prospect of. He shall have a stately monument. And a valley with springs of water to keep the turf green, was accounted an honourable burial place among eastern people; but such things are vain distinctions. Death closes his prosperity. It is but a poor encouragement to die, that others have died before us. That which makes a man die with true courage, is, with faith to remember that Jesus Christ died and was laid in the grave, not only before us, but for us. That He hath gone before us, and died for us, who is alive and liveth for us, is true consolation in the hour of death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How then comfort ye me in vain ... - That is, how can you be qualified to give me consolation in my trials, who have such erroneous views of the government and dealings of God? True consolation could be founded only on correct views of the divine government; but such views, Job says, they had not. With their conceptions of the divine administration, they could not administer to him any real consolation. We may learn hence,<p>(1) That all real consolation in trial must be based on correct apprehensions of the divine character and plans. Falsehood, delusion, error, can give no permanent comfort.<p>(2) They whose office it is to administer consolation to the afflicted, should seek after the "truth" about God and his government.<p>They should endeavor to learn why he afflicts people, what purpose he proposes to accomplish, and what are the proper ends of trial. They should have an unwavering conviction that he is right, and should see as far as possible "why" he is right, before they attempt to comfort others. Their own souls should be imbued with the fullest conviction that all the ways of God are holy, and then they should go and endeavor to pour their convictions into other hearts, and make them feel so too. A minister of the gospel, who has unsettled, erroneous, or false views of the character and government of God, is poorly qualified for his station, and will be a "miserable comforter" to those who are in trial. Truth alone sustains the soul in affliction. Truth only can inspire confidence in God. Truth only can break the force of sorrow, and enable the sufferer to look up to God and to heaven with confidence and joy.<p>(The end of Part One of the Commentary on Job) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. falsehood&#8212;literally, "transgression."

This is the conclusion Job draws from the above observations: his friends came to comfort him, and they took methods for it, as they thought, but miserable comforters were they all; what they administered for comfort was in vain, and to no purpose; nor could any be expected from them, on the plan upon which they proceeded; they suggested he was a bad man, because of his afflictions, and they exhorted him to repentance and reformation, and then promised him happiness and prosperity upon it; which could not be expected, as appeared from the face of things in Providence; since, according to the above instances and proofs, wicked men enjoy prosperity, and good men had usually a great share of adversity: <p>seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood; all their replies to Job were filled with these intimations and suggestions, that wicked men were only and always afflicted; or if they were at any time in prosperity, it was but for a little while; that good men were seldom or never afflicted, at least as Job was, or but a little afflicted, and for a little while: now Job had proved the contrary to all this, and therefore no consolation could be hoped for from men that held such tenets; comfort only springs from truth, and not falsehood; a man that speaks the truths, or delivers out the truths of God's word, he speaks to comfort and edification; but he that brings nothing but error and falsehood can never be the means and instrument of true solid comfort to any. Job having thus fully proved his point, and confuted the notions of his friends, it might have been thought they would have sat down in silence, and made no further answer; but Eliphaz rises up a third time, and makes a reply, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">How then comfort <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?</span><p>(u) Saying that the just in this world have prosperity and the wicked adversity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, which is the antecedent to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-29.htm">Job 21:29</a>, beginning with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm">Job 19:28</a>), he refers to words of the friends like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-22.htm">Job 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-15.htm">Job 18:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>. &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489; is prop. the noble man, whose heart impels (&#1504;&#1491;&#1489;, Arab. nadaba) him to what is good, or who is ready and willing, and does spontaneously that which is good (Arab. naduba), vid., Psychol.

It is not admissible to understand the double question as antithetical, with Wolfson, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-11.htm">Proverbs 14:11</a>; for the interrogative &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is not appropriate to the house of the &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;, in the proper sense of the word. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is not an externally but internally multiplying plur.; perhaps the poet by byt intends a palace in the city, and by &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; a tent among the wandering tribes, rendered prominent by its spaciousness and the splendour of the establishment.<p>(Note: Although the tents regularly consist of two divisions, one for the men and another for the women, the translation "magnificent pavilion" (Prachtgezelt), disputed by Hirz., is perfectly correct; for even in the present day a Beduin, as he approaches an encampment, knows the tent of the sheikh immediately: it is denoted by its size, often also by the lances planted at the door, and also, as is easily imagined, by the rich arrangement of cushions and carpets. Vid., Layard's New Discoveries, pp. 261 and 171.)<p>Job thinks the friends reason a priori since they inquire thus; the permanent fact of experience is quite different, as they can learn from &#1506;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, travellers, i.e., here: people who have travelled much, and therefore are well acquainted with the stories of human destinies. The Piel &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, proceeding from the radical meaning to gaze fixedly, is an enantio'seemon, since it signifies both to have regard to, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>, and to disown, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>; here it is to be translated: their &#1488;&#1514;&#1514; ye cannot nevertheless deny, ignore (as Arab. nakira and ankara). &#1488;&#1514;&#1514; are tokens, here: remarkable things, and indeed the remarkable histories related by them; Arab. a&#770;yatun (collective plur. a&#770;yun), signs, is also similarly used in the signification of Arab. &#8219;ibrat, example, historical teaching.<p>That the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, introduces the view of the friends, and is the antecedent clause to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-31.htm">Job 21:31</a> : quod (si) vos dicitis, in tempora cladis per iram divinam immissae servari et nescium futuri velut pecudem eo deduci improbum (Bttcher, de fin. 76), has in the double &#1500; an apparent support, which is not to be denied, especially in regard to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-23.htm">Job 38:23</a>; it is, however, on account of the omission of the indispensable &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493; in this instance, an explanation which does violence to the words. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, on the contrary, introduces that which the accounts of the travellers affirm. Further, the &#1500; in &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; indicates here not the terminus ad quem, but as in &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, in the evening, the terminus quo. And the verb &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;, cohibere, signifies here to hold back from danger, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-18.htm">Job 33:18</a>, therefore to preserve uninjured. Ew. translates <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a> erroneously: "in the day when the floods of wrath come on." How tame would this &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, "to be led near," be!

At the time, when streams of wrath (&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;, the overflowing of vexation  equals  outburst of wrath, like the Arab. &#8219;abrt, the overflowing of the eye  equals  tears) go forth, they remain untouched: they escape them, as being under a special, higher protection.<p>continued...</body></html>
