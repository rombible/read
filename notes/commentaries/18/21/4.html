But, on the contrary, my complaint is to God; and, concerning the ways of God, I venture to ask why it is that His justice is so tardy; and this is a problem which when I remember it I am troubled, and horror taketh hold on my flesh, so difficult and arduous is it.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm" title="As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?">Job 21:4</a>. </span><span class="ital">Is my complaint to man? — </span>No: if it were, I see it would be to little purpose to complain.

The "object" of the verse is plain. It is to state a reason why they should hear him with patience and without interruption. The meaning of this part of the verse probably is, that his principal difficulty was not with his friends, but with God. It was not so much what they had said, that gave him trouble, as it was what God had done. Severe and cutting as were their rebukes, yet it was far more trying to him to be treated as he had been by God, "as if" he were a great sinner. That was what he could not understand. Perplexed and troubled, therefore, by the mysteriousness of the divine dealings, his friends ought to be willing to listen patiently to what he had to say; and in his anxiety to find out "why" God had treated him so, they ought not at once to infer that he was a wicked man, and to overwhelm him with increased anguish of spirit.<p>It will be recollected that Job repeatedly expressed the wish to be permitted to carry his cause at once up to God, and to have his adjudication on it. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18</a>, notes. It is that to which he refers when he says here, that he wished to have the cause before God, and not before man. It was a matter which he wished to refer to the Almighty, and he ought to be allowed to express his sentiments with entire freedom. One of the difficulties in understanding this verse arises from the word "complaint." We use it in the sense of "murmuring," or "repining;" but this, I think, is not its meaning here. It is used rather in the sense of "cause, argument, reasoning, or reflections." The Hebrew word &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;  s&#769;&#305;&#770;y&#305;&#770;ch means, properly, that which is "brought out" - from &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;  s&#769;&#305;&#770;yach, "to bring out, to put forth, to produce" - as buds, leaves, flowers; and then it means "words" - as brought out, or spoken; and then, meditations, reflections, discourses, speeches; and then it "may" mean "complaint." But there is no evidence that the word is used in that sense here. It means his reflections, or arguments. They were not to man. He wished to carry them at once before God, and he ought, therefore, to be allowed to speak freely. Jerome renders it, "disputatio mea." The Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  elengcis - used here, probably, in the sense of "an argument to produce conviction," as it is often.<p>And if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? - Margin, "shortened," meaning the same as troubled, afflicted, or impatient. A more literal translation will better express the idea which is now lost sight of, "And if so, why should not my spirit be distressed?" That is, since my cause is with God - since my difficulty is in understanding his dealings with me - since I have carried my cause up to him, and all now depends on him, why should I not be allowed to have solicitude in regard to the result? If I manifest anxiety, who can blame me? Who would not, when his all was at stake, and when the divine dealings toward him were so mysterious? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Job's difficulty was not as to man, but as to God, why He so afflicted him, as if he were the guilty hypocrite which the friends alleged him to be. Vulgate translates it, "my disputation."<p>if it were&#8212;rather, "since this is the case."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To man; </span> or, <span class="ital">of man</span>; for the prefix <span class="ital">lamed</span> commonly signifieth both <span class="ital">to</span> and <span class="ital">of</span>. And this question implies a denial, or that his complaint is not to or of man, to wit, only, but to or of God; as is here sufficiently implied, and oft elsewhere expressed by Job in this book. So the sense seems to be either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. This, I do not make my moan or complaint unto, or expect relief from, you, or from any men, but from God only; and therefore you have reason patiently to hear me when I am pouring forth my complaints to God. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. This, Do I only complain, or have I reason to complain, only of you and your unmerciful carriage to me; or of men who have dealt barbarously with me? <span class="bld">Job 1 Job 30:1,9</span>, &c. Surely no; but, my complaint is of God, and of his hard and severe dealing with me. It is he who hath alienated my friends’ affections from me, and stirred up mine enemies against me. And though it hath been my chief care and business to please and serve him, yet he hath also set himself against me, and shot all his arrows into me. And therefore my expostulation with him (which here follows, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm" title="Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, are mighty in power?">Job 21:7</a></span>) is the more reasonable; and if you will hear me calmly and patiently, you will find that I have cause of complaining. <span class="ital">If it were so</span>, i.e. if my complaint were only of man, I have cause to be troubled. Or, <span class="ital">if</span> it be so, i.e. if I do not complain of man, but of God, it is no wonder if my spirit be greatly oppressed; and you ought to allow me the liberty of easing my troubled mind, and modestly pleading my cause before God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Be troubled, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">be shortened</span>, or <span class="ital">straitened</span>, i.e. either grieved or vexed, as this word signifies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-9.htm" title="And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel: but they listened not to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.">Exodus 6:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm" title="And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.">Numbers 21:4</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-16.htm" title="And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.">Judges 10:16</a> 16:16</span> The heart is enlarged by joy, and contracted by sorrow; as appears by philosophy and experience. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As for me, is my complaint to man?.... Job had been complaining, and still was, and continued to do so after this, but not to them, his friends, nor any other man; his complaint was made to God, and of him he thought he was hardly dealt with by him, he could not tell for what; he had desired to know the reason why he contended with him in such a manner, but could get no satisfaction; when his friends came first to visit him, they said nothing to him, nor he to them; and when he did speak, it was not to them, but to God, of whom he complains; and expostulates with him why he had ever been born, or had not died as soon as born, and not have lived to have seen such unhappy days, and endured so much affliction and trouble: <p>and if it were so; that he had made his complaint to man, since it would have been in vain, and to no purpose, he should have got no relief, nor obtained any satisfaction: <p>why should not my spirit be troubled? or "shortened" (l); or, as the Targum, be straitened; for as comfort and joy enlarge the heart, trouble contracts and straitens it; or is "my prayer" or (m) "petition to men?" it was not, though he was reduced so low, and was in such a distressed condition; he had asked nothing of men, not of these his friends, neither to give him of their substance, nor to help him out of the hands of his enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a>; he had poured out his complaint before God, and had directed his prayer to the God of his life; he had desired to speak to none but the Almighty, and to reason only with him; he had petitioned him to take cognizance of his case, and to admit of a hearing of it before him, and to have it determined by him; he had complained of wrongs and injuries done him, and begged to be redressed and righted, but got no answer; God did not think fit to answer him, but hid himself from him, and continued so to do: "and if", if this be the case, as it really was, "why should not my spirit be troubled?" is there not reason for it? Some think Job's meaning is, is "my disputation", as the Vulgate Latin version, or is my discourse concerning human things, things within the compass of human knowledge and reasoning? or, to be attained to by the force of that, without divine revelation? no, it is concerning divine things; concerning the mysteries of Providence, with respect to good and bad men; concerning the living Redeemer, his incarnation, resurrection, &amp;c. and faith in him; concerning the general resurrection, the final judgment, and a future state of happiness: or does my complaint, petition, or discourse, savour of that which is human, and is intermixed with human frailty? if it be so, it should be borne with, it should be considered I am but a man, and liable to err; and especially great allowances should be made in my present circumstances, being trader such sore afflictions; and it may be reasonably thought, that though the spirit may be willing to behave in a better manner, the flesh is weak, and much must be imputed unto that; and it will not seem so extravagant to indulge a troubled spirit so severely exercised; persons under afflictions generally think they do well to be troubled, and that there is reason enough for it, and ought to be borne with, and not to be reproached and rallied on that account. <p>(l) "abbreviabitur", Montanus, Vatablus, "abbreviaretur", Drusius, Cocceius, Michaelis.

By this translation &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495; is equivalent to &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, since attention is given to the gender of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; in the verb immediately connected with it, but it is left out of consideration in the verbs &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; which stand further form it, which Olshausen thinks doubtful; there are, however, not a few examples which may be adduced in favour of it, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>; comp.
