Wherefore is it so? This is the day of God's patience; and, in some way or other, he makes use of the prosperity of the wicked to serve his own counsels, while it ripens them for ruin; but the chief reason is, because he will make it appear there is another world. These prospering sinners make light of God and religion, as if because they have so much of this world, they had no need to look after another. But religion is not a vain thing. If it be so to us, we may thank ourselves for resting on the outside of it. Job shows their folly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their houses are safe from fear - Margin, "peace from." The friends of Job had maintained just the contrary; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-27.htm">Job 20:27-28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-24</a>. Their idea was, that the wicked man would never be free from alarms. Job says, that they lived in security and peace, and that their houses are preserved from the intrusions of evil-minded people.<p>Neither is the rod of God upon them - The "rod" is an emblem of punishment. The idea is, that they were free from the chastisements which their sins deserved. There can be no doubt that there are cases enough in which the wicked live in security, to justify Job in all that he here affirms, as there are instances enough in which the wicked are cut off for their sins. to make what his friends said plausible. The truth is, good and evil are intermingled. There is a "general" course of events by which the wicked are involved in calamity in this life, and the righteous are prospered; but still, there are so many exceptions as to show the necessity of a future state of rewards and punishments. To us, who look to that future world, all is clear. But that view of the future state of retribution was not possessed by Job and his friends. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Literally, "peace from fear"; with poetic force. Their house is peace itself, far removed from fear. Opposed to the friends' assertion, as to the bad (Job 15:21-24; 20:26-28), and conversely, the good (Job 5:23, 24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They neither fear nor feel any disturbance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Their houses are safe from fear,....

They cut the knot by wounding Job most deeply by ever more and more frivolous accusations. Therefore he entreats them to be at least willing to listen (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; with the gerund) to his utterance (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) respecting the unsolved enigma; then (Waw apodosis imper.) shall this attention supply the place of their consolations, i.e., be comforting to him, which their previous supposed consolations could not be. They are to bear with him, i.e., without interruption allow him to answer for himself (&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; with Kametz before the tone, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-12.htm">Jonah 1:12</a>, comp. &#1511;&#1495;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-33.htm">1 Kings 20:33</a>, not as Hirz. thinks under the influence of the distinctive accent, but according to the established rule, Ges. 60, rem. 1); then he will speak (&#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; contrast to the "ye" in &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; without further force), and after he has expressed himself they may mock. It is, however, not &#1514;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468; (as Olshausen corrects), but &#1514;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1490; (in a voluntative signific.  equals  &#1514;&#1500;&#1506;&#1490;), since Job here addresses himself specially to Zophar, the whole of whose last speech must have left the impression on him of a bitter sarcasm (sarkasmo's from sarka'zein in the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a>), and has dealt him the freshest deep blow. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a> &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1514; is not to be understood otherwise than as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-13.htm">Job 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a>, and is to be translated "my complaint." Then the prominently placed &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; is to be taken, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17</a>, Ges. 121, 3, as an emphatic strengthening of the "my": he places his complaint in contrast with another. This emphasizing is not easily understood, if one, with Hupf., explains: nonne hominis est querela mea, so that &#1492; is equivalent to &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; (which here in the double question is doubly doubtful), and &#1500; is the sign of the cause. Schultens and Berg, who translate &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; more humano, explain similarly, by again bringing their suspicious &#1500; comparativum<p>(Note: In the passage from Ibn-Kissa quoted above, p. 421, Schultens, as Fleischer assures me, has erroneously read Arab. lmcha&#770;l&#305;&#770;b instead of kmcha&#770;l&#305;&#770;b, having been misled by the frequent failing of the upper stroke of the Arab. k, and in general Arab. l is never  equals  k, and also &#1500; never  equals  &#1499;, as has been imagined since Schultens.)<p>here to bear upon it. The &#1500; by &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497; (if it may not also be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-8.htm">Job 12:8</a>) may certainly be expected to denote those to whom the complaint is addressed. We translate: As for me, then, does my complaint concern men? The &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; which is placed at the beginning of the sentence comes no less under the rule, Ges. 145, 2, than 121, 3. In general, sufferers seek to obtain alleviation of their sufferings by imploring by words and groans the pity of sympathizing men; the complaint, however, which the three hear from him is of a different kind, for he has long since given up the hope of human sympathy, - his complaint concerns not men, but God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-20.htm">Job 16:20</a>).<p>continued...</body></html>
