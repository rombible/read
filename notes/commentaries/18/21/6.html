As Job well knew that the account he was about to give of the prosperity of wicked men, however necessary to his argument, would have something shocking in it to the ears of those to whom it was addressed, the delicacy with which he thus introduces it is inimitable.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-6 Job comes closer to the question in dispute. This was, Whether outward prosperity is a mark of the true church, and the true members of it, so that ruin of a man's prosperity proves him a hypocrite? This they asserted, but Job denied. If they looked upon him, they might see misery enough to demand compassion, and their bold interpretations of this mysterious providence should be turned into silent wonder.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even when I remember, I am afraid - I have an internal shuddering and horror when I recall the scenes through which I have passed. I am myself utterly overwhelmed at the magnitude of my own sufferings, and they are such as should excite commiseration in your hearts. Some, however, have connected this with the following verse, supposing the idea to be, that he was horror-stricken when he contemplated the prosperity of wicked people. But there seems to me to be no reason for this interpretation. His object is undoubtedly to show them that there was enough in his ease to awe them into silence; and he says, in order to show that, that the recollection of his sufferings perfectly overwhelmed "him," and filled him with horror. They who have passed through scenes of special danger, or of great bodily suffering, can easily sympathize with Job here. The very recollection will make the flesh tremble. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. remember&#8212;Think on it.

Total darkness, which will finally destroy them, is decreed by God against these stores of the godless, which are brought together not as coming from the hand of God, but covetously, and regardless of Him.

All these forms are not resolved forms of Piel (Ges., Berth., Olsh. 248, a), but contracted forms of Poel with Kametz-chatuph instead of Cholem. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-9.htm">Job 13:9</a>, is not a resolved form of Piel, but a non-syncopated Hiphil.

By this translation &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495; is equivalent to &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, since attention is given to the gender of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; in the verb immediately connected with it, but it is left out of consideration in the verbs &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; which stand further form it, which Olshausen thinks doubtful; there are, however, not a few examples which may be adduced in favour of it, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>; comp. Ges. 147, rem. 1. Certainly the relative clause &#1500;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; may also be explained by supplying &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;: into which one has not blown, or that one has not blown on (Symm., Theod., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;): both renderings are possible, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-22.htm">Ezekiel 22:22</a>; but since the masc. &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; follows, having undoubtedly &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; as its subject, we can unhesitatingly take the Synallage gen. as beginning even with &#1504;&#1508;&#1495;. A fire which needs no human help for its kindling and its maintenance is intended (comp. on &#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a>); therefore "fire of God," <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>.

Kal; the form of writing &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; (fut. apoc. Niph.) proposed by Olsh. on account of the change of gender, i.e., it is devoured, is to be rejected for the reason assigned in connection with &#1504;&#1508;&#1495;. The correct interpretation has been brought forward by Schultens.<p>It is not without reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18-19</a>, where Job has called upon earth and heaven as witnesses, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-27.htm">Job 20:27</a> Zophar continues: "the heavens reveal his guilt, and the earth rises against him;" heaven and earth bear witness to his being an abhorrence, not worthy of being borne by the earth and shone upon by the light of heaven; they testify this, since their powers from below and above vie with one another to get rid of him. &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is connected closely with &#1500;&#1493; (which has Lamed raphatum) by means of Mercha-Zinnorith, and under the influence of the law, according to which before a monosyllabic accented word the tone is drawn back from the last syllable of the preceding word to the penultima (Ew. 73, 3), is accented as Milel on account of the pause.<p>continued...</body></html>
