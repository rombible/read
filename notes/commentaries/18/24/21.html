They are taken off with other men, as the harvestman gathers the ears of corn as they come to hand. There will often appear much to resemble the wrong view of Providence Job takes in this chapter. But we are taught by the word of inspiration, that these notions are formed in ignorance, from partial views. The providence of God, in the affairs of men, is in every thing a just and wise providence. Let us apply this whenever the Lord may try us. He cannot do wrong. The unequalled sorrows of the Son of God when on earth, unless looked at in this view, perplex the mind. But when we behold him, as the sinner's Surety, bearing the curse, we can explain why he should endure that wrath which was due to sin, that Divine justice might be satisfied, and his people saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He evil entreateth the barren - The woman who has no children to comfort or support her.

Here Job returns, to give some further account of the sins of some wicked men, who prosper in this world, and go through it with impunity; and speaks of such that use their wives ill because they are barren, upbraid them with it, and are churlish to them on account of it; or use them ill that they may be barren, and bear no children, having no pleasure in them, as not in vineyards, before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a>; and some interpret this of deflowering virgins, who never bore children, and of using methods to make them abortive, when with child; the word we translate "evil entreateth" sometimes signifies joining to, or being a companion of others, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; hence various senses are given; some, he joins himself to a barren woman, that he may have no children, being not desirous of any; others, he, joins himself to, and is a companion of harlots, who are commonly barren: and like the prodigal, spends his substance among them. Some interpreters take this verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a>; as expressive of the punishment of wicked men: so Mr. Broughton renders the words, "he adjoineth the barren" (d), and gives the sense of them thus; God sends after him a barren wife, that he shall have no help by children; but, though a numerous offspring has been reckoned an outward happiness, and not to have any an infelicity, yet it has been the case of many good men and women to be childless; wherefore love and hatred are not known hereby: besides, such a sense is contrary to the scope and design of Job, which is to prove that wicked men often go unpunished in this life; wherefore, rather the meaning is, that a wicked man uses ill such, who having not only lost their husbands, but having been barren, and so childless, have none to take their part, and to protect and defend them from the abuses of such men; the Targum renders the word, "he breaketh", and so some understand it (e); he breaketh the barren, tears them to pieces, ruins and destroys them, as to their outward substance, because they have no children to help them; with which agrees what follows, <p>and doth not good to the widow; does not make her glad and cheerful, as Job did, who made the widow's heart to sing for joy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; does not relieve and assist her when in distress, either by counsel and advice, or by administering to her necessities; but, on the contrary, afflicts and oppresses her; takes her ox, or her raiment, for a pledge, and plunders her house, and devours the substance of it; for more is intended than is expressed. <p>(d)  "consociat ei sterilem", Junius &amp; Tremellius.

Oppressors of another class are perhaps here spoken of, or perhaps there is a mere return to the idea with which Job's enumeration opened (ver. 3), which was the oppression of the weaker and more defenceless classes. As barrenness in women was considered the greatest possible misfortune (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1-10</a>), so oppressing one that was barren indicated extreme cruelty<span class="cmt_word">.

Their general characteristic is, that they shun the light. Those who are described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a> are described according to their general characteristic in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>; accordingly it is not to be interpreted: those belong to the enemies of the light, but: those are, according to their very nature, enemies of the light. The Beth is the so-called Beth essent.; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>) affirms what they are become by their own inclination, or as what they are fashioned, viz., as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Symm.); &#1502;&#1512;&#1491; (on the root &#1502;&#1512;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a>) signifies properly to push one's self against anything, to lean upon, to rebel; &#1502;&#1512;&#1491; therefore signifies one who strives against another, one who is obstinate (like the Arabic ma&#770;rid, mer&#305;&#770;d, comp. muma&#770;ri, not conformable to the will of another). The improvement &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; (not with Makkeph, but with Mahpach of mercha mahpach. placed between the two words, vid., Br's Psalterium, p. x.) assumes the possibility of the construction with the acc., which occurs at least once, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-19.htm">Joshua 22:19</a>. They are hostile to the light, they have no familiarity with its ways (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-17.htm">Joshua 22:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-19.htm">Ruth 2:19</a>, to take knowledge of anything, to interest one's self in its favour), and do not dwell (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, Jer. reversi sunt, according to the false reading &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;) in its paths, i.e., they neither make nor feel themselves at home there, they have no peace therein. The light is the light of day, which, however, stands in deeper, closer relation to the higher light, for the vicious man hateth &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>, in every sense; and the works which are concealed in the darkness of the night are also &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>), in the sense in which light and darkness are two opposite principles of the spiritual world. It need not seem strange that the more minute description of the conduct of these enemies of the light now begins with &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. It is impossible that this should mean: still in the darkness of the night (Stick.), prop. towards the light, when it is not yet light. Moreover, in biblical Hebrew, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; does not signify evening, in which sense it occurs in Talmudic Hebrew (Pesachim 1a, Seder olam rabba, c. 5, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;, vespera septima), like &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; ( equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;) in Talmudic Aramaic. The meaning, on the contrary, is that towards daybreak (comp. &#1492;&#1489;&#1511;&#1512; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-3.htm">Genesis 44:3</a>), therefore with early morning, the murderer rises up, to go about his work, which veils itself in darkness (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8-10</a>) by day, viz., to slay (comp. on &#1497;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;...&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, Ges. 142, 3, c) the unfortunate and the poor, who pass by defenceless and alone. One has to supply the idea of the ambush in which the waylayer lies in wait; and it is certainly inconvenient that it is not expressed.<p>The antithesis &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>, shows that nothing but primo mane is meant by &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. He who in the day-time goes forth to murder and plunder, at night commits petty thefts, where no one whom he could attack passes by. Stickel translates: to slay the poor and wretched, and in the night to play the thief; but then the subjunctivus &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; ought to precede (vid., e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>), and in general it cannot be proved without straining it, that the voluntative form of the future everywhere has a modal signification. Moreover, here &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; does not differ from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>, but is only a poetic shorter form for &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;: in the night he is like a thief, i.e., plays the part of the thief. And the adulterer's eye observes the darkness of evening (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-9.htm">Proverbs 7:9</a>), i.e., watches closely for its coming on (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, in the usual signification observare, to be on the watch, to take care, observe anxiously), since he hopes to render himself invisible; and that he may not be recognised even if seen, he puts on a mask. &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is something by which his countenance is rendered unrecognisable (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), like the Arab. sitr, sita&#770;reh, a curtain, veil, therefore a veil for the face, or, as we say in one word borrowed from the Arabic mascharat, a farce (masquerade): the mask, but not in the proper sense.<p>(Note: The mask was perhaps never known in Palestine and Syria; &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is the mend&#305;&#770;l or women's veil, which in the present day (in Hauran exclusively) is called sitr, and is worn over the face by all married women in the towns, while in the country it is worn hanging down the back, and is only drawn over the face in the presence of a stranger. If this explanation is correct the poet means to say that the adulterer, in order to remain undiscovered, wears women's clothes comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>; and, in fact, in the Syrian towns (the figure is taken from town-life) women's clothing is always chosen for that kind of forbidden nocturnal undertaking, i.e., the man disguises himself in an &#305;&#770;za&#770;r, which covers him from head to foot, takes the mend&#305;&#770;l, and goes with a lantern (without which at night every person is seized by the street watchman as a suspicious person) unhindered into a strange house. - Wetzst.) </body></html>
