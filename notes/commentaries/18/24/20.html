They are taken off with other men, as the harvestman gathers the ears of corn as they come to hand. There will often appear much to resemble the wrong view of Providence Job takes in this chapter. But we are taught by the word of inspiration, that these notions are formed in ignorance, from partial views. The providence of God, in the affairs of men, is in every thing a just and wise providence. Let us apply this whenever the Lord may try us. He cannot do wrong. The unequalled sorrows of the Son of God when on earth, unless looked at in this view, perplex the mind. But when we behold him, as the sinner's Surety, bearing the curse, we can explain why he should endure that wrath which was due to sin, that Divine justice might be satisfied, and his people saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The womb shall forget him - His mother who bare him shall forget him. The idea here seems to be, that he shall fade out of the memory, just as other persons do. He shall not be overtaken with any disgraceful punishment, thus giving occasion to remember him by a death of ignominy. At first view it would seem to be a calamity to be soon forgotten by a mother; but if the above interpretation be correct, then it means that the condition of his death would be such that there would be no occasion for a mother to remember him with sorrow and shame, as she would one who was ignominiously executed for his crimes. This interpretation was proposed by Mercer, and has been adopted by Rosenmuller, Noyes, and others. It accords with the general scope of the passage, and is probably correct. Various other interpretations, however, have been proposed, which may be seen in Good, and in the Critici Sacri.<p>The worm shall feed sweetly on him - As on others. He shall die and be buried in the usual manner. He shall lie quietly in the grave, and there return to his native dust. He shall not be suspended on a gibbet, or torn and devoured by wild beasts; but his death and burial shall be peaceful and calm; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-26.htm">Job 21:26</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a>, note.<p>He shall be no more remembered - As having been a man of eminent guilt, or as ignominiously punished. The meaning is, that there is nothing marked and distinguishing in his death. There is no special manifestation of the divine displeasure. There is some truth in this, that the wicked cease to be remembered. People hasten to forget them; and having done no good that makes them the objects of grateful reminiscence, their memory fades away. This, so far from being a calamity and a curse, Job regards as a favor. It would be a calamity to be remembered as a bad man, and as having died an ignominious death.<p>And wickedness shall be broken as a tree - Evil here or wickedness (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;avla&#770;h) means an evil or wicked man. The idea seems to be, that such a man would die as a tree that is stripped of its leaves and branches is broken down. He is not like a green tree that is violently torn up by the roots in a storm, or twisted off in a tempest, but like a dry tree that begins to decay, and that falls down gently by its own weight. It lives to be old, and then quietly sinks on the ground and dies. So Job says it is with the wicked. They are not swept away by the divine judgments, as the trees of the forest are torn up by the roots or twisted off by the tornado. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

His mother that bore him; or his wife, by whom he had many children; or his friend, as Gersom, who had a tender and affectionate respect for him; these all, and each of them, either because of his wicked life and infamous death, care not to speak of him, but bury him in oblivion; or because of his quiet and easy death, are not distressed with it, but soon forget him; unless this is to be understood of the womb of the earth, in which being buried, he lies forgotten, to which the next clause agrees; though some interpret it of God himself the word having the signification of mercy (b); who, though mercy itself, is rich and abundant in it, yet has no mercy for, nor shows any favour to, such men; but they lie in the grave among those whom he remembers no more in a way of grace and favour, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-5.htm">Psalm 85:5</a>; <p>the worm shall feed sweetly on him; for being brought to the grave at once, without any wasting distemper, is a fine repast for worms, his breasts being full of milk, and his bones moistened with marrow, and full of flesh; or "the worm is sweet unto him" (c); he feels no pain by its feeding on him, and so the sense is just the same with that expression, "the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him", <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-33.htm">Job 21:33</a>; <p>he shall be no more remembered; with any mark of honour and respect; his memory shall rot with him, while the righteous are had in everlasting remembrance; or rather dying a common death, and not made a public example of: <p>and wickedness shall be broken as a tree; that is, wicked men, who are wickedness itself, extremely wicked, and are like to a tree, sometimes flourishing in external prosperity, having an affluence of the things of this world, and always like barren and unfruitful trees, with respect to grace and good works; these, when the axe of death is laid to the root of them, they are cut down, and their substance comes to nothing, and their families are destroyed, and so they become like trees struck with thunder and lightning, and broken into ten thousand shivers; or as the trees in Egypt were broken to pieces by the plague of hail, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-25.htm">Exodus 9:25</a>. <p>(b) "misericordia", V.

Their general characteristic is, that they shun the light. Those who are described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a> are described according to their general characteristic in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>; accordingly it is not to be interpreted: those belong to the enemies of the light, but: those are, according to their very nature, enemies of the light. The Beth is the so-called Beth essent.; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>) affirms what they are become by their own inclination, or as what they are fashioned, viz., as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Symm.); &#1502;&#1512;&#1491; (on the root &#1502;&#1512;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a>) signifies properly to push one's self against anything, to lean upon, to rebel; &#1502;&#1512;&#1491; therefore signifies one who strives against another, one who is obstinate (like the Arabic ma&#770;rid, mer&#305;&#770;d, comp. muma&#770;ri, not conformable to the will of another). The improvement &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; (not with Makkeph, but with Mahpach of mercha mahpach. placed between the two words, vid., Br's Psalterium, p. x.) assumes the possibility of the construction with the acc., which occurs at least once, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-19.htm">Joshua 22:19</a>. They are hostile to the light, they have no familiarity with its ways (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-17.htm">Joshua 22:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-19.htm">Ruth 2:19</a>, to take knowledge of anything, to interest one's self in its favour), and do not dwell (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, Jer. reversi sunt, according to the false reading &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;) in its paths, i.e., they neither make nor feel themselves at home there, they have no peace therein. The light is the light of day, which, however, stands in deeper, closer relation to the higher light, for the vicious man hateth &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>, in every sense; and the works which are concealed in the darkness of the night are also &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>), in the sense in which light and darkness are two opposite principles of the spiritual world. It need not seem strange that the more minute description of the conduct of these enemies of the light now begins with &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. It is impossible that this should mean: still in the darkness of the night (Stick.), prop. towards the light, when it is not yet light. Moreover, in biblical Hebrew, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; does not signify evening, in which sense it occurs in Talmudic Hebrew (Pesachim 1a, Seder olam rabba, c. 5, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;, vespera septima), like &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; ( equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;) in Talmudic Aramaic. The meaning, on the contrary, is that towards daybreak (comp. &#1492;&#1489;&#1511;&#1512; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-3.htm">Genesis 44:3</a>), therefore with early morning, the murderer rises up, to go about his work, which veils itself in darkness (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8-10</a>) by day, viz., to slay (comp. on &#1497;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;...&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, Ges. 142, 3, c) the unfortunate and the poor, who pass by defenceless and alone. One has to supply the idea of the ambush in which the waylayer lies in wait; and it is certainly inconvenient that it is not expressed.<p>The antithesis &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>, shows that nothing but primo mane is meant by &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. He who in the day-time goes forth to murder and plunder, at night commits petty thefts, where no one whom he could attack passes by. Stickel translates: to slay the poor and wretched, and in the night to play the thief; but then the subjunctivus &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; ought to precede (vid., e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>), and in general it cannot be proved without straining it, that the voluntative form of the future everywhere has a modal signification. Moreover, here &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; does not differ from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>, but is only a poetic shorter form for &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;: in the night he is like a thief, i.e., plays the part of the thief. And the adulterer's eye observes the darkness of evening (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-9.htm">Proverbs 7:9</a>), i.e., watches closely for its coming on (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, in the usual signification observare, to be on the watch, to take care, observe anxiously), since he hopes to render himself invisible; and that he may not be recognised even if seen, he puts on a mask. &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is something by which his countenance is rendered unrecognisable (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), like the Arab. sitr, sita&#770;reh, a curtain, veil, therefore a veil for the face, or, as we say in one word borrowed from the Arabic mascharat, a farce (masquerade): the mask, but not in the proper sense.<p>(Note: The mask was perhaps never known in Palestine and Syria; &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is the mend&#305;&#770;l or women's veil, which in the present day (in Hauran exclusively) is called sitr, and is worn over the face by all married women in the towns, while in the country it is worn hanging down the back, and is only drawn over the face in the presence of a stranger. If this explanation is correct the poet means to say that the adulterer, in order to remain undiscovered, wears women's clothes comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>; and, in fact, in the Syrian towns (the figure is taken from town-life) women's clothing is always chosen for that kind of forbidden nocturnal undertaking, i.e., the man disguises himself in an &#305;&#770;za&#770;r, which covers him from head to foot, takes the mend&#305;&#770;l, and goes with a lantern (without which at night every person is seized by the street watchman as a suspicious person) unhindered into a strange house. - Wetzst.) </body></html>
