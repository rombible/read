He notices those that do wrong under pretence of law and authority; and robbers, those that do wrong by force. He says, God layeth not folly to them; that is, he does not at once send his judgments, nor make them examples, and so manifest their folly to all the world.

To remove them, by carrying them on to the land of another, was an act of dishonesty and robbery - since it was only by marks that the extent of a man's property could be known. Fences were uncommon; the art of surveying was not well understood, and deeds describing land were probably unknown also, and their whole dependence, therefore, was on the stones that were erected to mark the boundaries of a lot or farm. As it was not difficult to remove them, it became a matter of special importance to guard against it, and to make it a crime of magnitude. Accordingly, it was forbidden in the strictest manner in the law of Moses. "Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's land-mark;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-17.htm">Deuteronomy 27:17</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-28.htm">Proverbs 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-10.htm">Proverbs 23:10</a>.<p>And feed thereof - Margin, "or, them." The margin is correct. The meaning is, that they drive off the flocks of others, and "pasture" them; that is, they are at no pains to conceal what they do, but mingle them with their own herds, and feed them as if they were their own. If they drove them away to kill, and removed them wholly from view, it would be less shameful than to keep and claim them as their own, and to make the robbery so public. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-24.

Anciently set to distinguish one man's land from another, to secure property, and preserve from encroachments; but some were so wicked as either secretly in the night to remove them, or openly to do it, having power on their side, pretending they were wrongly located; this was not only prohibited by the law of God, and pronounced an accursed thing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; but was reckoned so before the law was given, being known to be such by the light of nature, as what was now, and here condemned, was before that law was in being; and so we find that this was accounted an execrable thing among the Heathens, who had a deity they called Jupiter Terminalis, who was appointed over bounds and landmarks; so Numa Pompilius appointed stones to be set as bounds to everyone's lands, and dedicated them to Jupiter Terminalis, and ordered that those that removed them should be slain as sacrilegious persons, and they and their oxen devoted to destruction (f): some render it, "they touch the landmarks" (g), as if to touch them was unlawful, and therefore much more to remove them: <p>they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof; not content with a sheep or a lamb, they took away whole flocks, and that by force and violence, openly and publicly, and slew them, and fed on them; or else took them and put them into their own grounds, or such as they had got by encroachments from others, where they fed them without any fear of men; which shows the effrontery and impudence of them. <p>(f) Dion.

Where neighbouring properties are not divided by fences of any kind, as in the East generally, the only way of distinguishing between one man's land and another's is by termini, or "landmarks," which are generally low stone metes or bourns, placed at intervals on the boundary-line.

( equals  Arab. f) without the retrospective pronoun &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (which is omitted for poetic brevity). On this prominence of a separate notion after the manner of an antecedent. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, like &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>, and &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>, is not causative, but simply active in signification. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a> the question arises, whether &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; &#1502;&#1503; is one expression, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>, in the sense of "hiding from another," or whether &#1502;&#1503; is comparative. In the former sense Hirz. explains: I removed the divine will from the possible ascendancy of my own. But since &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is familiar to the poet in the sense of preserving and laying by (&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;( y, treasures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>), it is more natural to explain, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a> : I kept the words (commands) of Thy mouth, i.e., esteemed them high and precious, more than my statute, i.e., more than what my own will prescribed for me.<p>(Note: Wetzstein arranges the significations of &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; as follows: - 1.((Beduin) intr. fut. i, to contain one's self, to keep still (hence in Hebr. to lie in wait), to be rapt in thought; conjug. II. c. acc. pers. to make any one thoughtful, irresolute. 2.((Hebr.) trans. fut. o, to keep anything to one's self, to hold back, to keep to one's self; Niph. to be held back, i.e., either concealed or reserved for future use. Thus we see how, on the one hand, &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is related to &#1496;&#1502;&#1503;, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a> (Arab. itmaanna, to be still); and, on the other, can interchange with &#1510;&#1508;&#1492; in the signification designare (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-22.htm">Job 15:22</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>), and to spy, lie in wait (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-32.htm">Psalm 37:32</a>).)<p>The meaning is substantially the same; the lxx, which translates &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;), which Olsh. considers to be "perhaps correct," destroys the significance of the confession. Hirz. rightly refers to the "law in the members," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a> : &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497; is the expression Job uses for the law of the sinful nature which strives against the law of God, the wilful impulse of selfishness and evil passion, the law which the apostle describes as &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in distinction from the &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (Psychol. S. 379). Job's conscience can give him this testimony, but He, the God who so studiously avoids him, remains in one mind, viz., to treat him as a criminal; and who can turn Him from His purpose? (the same question as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-12.htm">Job 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-10.htm">Job 11:10</a>); His soul wills it (stat pro ratione voluntas), and He accomplishes it. Most expositors explain permanet in uno in this sense; the Beth is the usual &#1489; with verbs of entering upon and persisting in anything. Others, however, take the &#1489; as Beth essentiae: He remains one and the same, viz., in His conduct towards me (Umbr., Vaih.), or: He is one, is alone, viz., in absolute majesty (Targ. Jer.; Schult., Ew., Hlgst., Schlottm.), which is admissible, since this Beth occurs not only in the complements of a sentence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>, like a shadow; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>, after the manner of silver; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>, in great number; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>, as my help), but also with the predicate of a simple sentence, be it verbal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>) or substantival (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>). The same construction is found also in Arabic, where, however, it is more frequent in simple negative clauses than in affirmative (vid., Psalter, i. 272). The assertion: He is one (as in the primary monotheistic confession, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), is, however, an expression for the absoluteness of God, which is not suited to this connection; and if &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; is intended to be understood of the unchangeable uniformity of His purpose concerning Job, the explanation: versatur (perstat) in uno, Arab. hua fi wa&#770;hidin, is not only equally, but more natural, and we therefore prefer it.<p>continued...</body></html>
