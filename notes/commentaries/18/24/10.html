That many live at ease who are ungodly and profane, he had showed, ch. xxi. Here he shows that many who live in open defiance of all the laws of justice, succeed in wicked practices; and we do not see them reckoned with in this world. He notices those that do wrong under pretence of law and authority; and robbers, those that do wrong by force. He says, God layeth not folly to them; that is, he does not at once send his judgments, nor make them examples, and so manifest their folly to all the world.

First of all, the poor man, whose only wrap or cloak has been taken in pledge, is com-polled to go naked, or almost naked, both day and night, exposed alike to extremes of heat and cold. Secondly, he is compelled to reap and bind and carry home the sheaves of his oppressor, while he himself is half famished with hunger. The second clause of the verse is wrongly translated in the Authorized Version, where we read, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; the real meaning being, "and they who are an hungered, carry the sheaves" (compare the Revised Version). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Wherefore are not bounds reserved by the Almighty,<p>And they who honour Him see not His days?<p>  2  They remove the landmarks,<p>They steal flocks and shepherd them.<p>  3  They carry away the ass of the orphan,<p>And distrain the ox of the widow.<p>  4  They thrust the needy out of the way,<p>The poor of the land are obliged to slink away together.<p>The supposition that the text originally stood &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; &#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; is natural; but it is at once destroyed by the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-1.htm">Job 24:1</a> becomes thereby disproportionately long, and yet cannot be divided into two lines of comparatively independent contents.
