They are taken off with other men, as the harvestman gathers the ears of corn as they come to hand. There will often appear much to resemble the wrong view of Providence Job takes in this chapter. But we are taught by the word of inspiration, that these notions are formed in ignorance, from partial views. The providence of God, in the affairs of men, is in every thing a just and wise providence. Let us apply this whenever the Lord may try us. He cannot do wrong. The unequalled sorrows of the Son of God when on earth, unless looked at in this view, perplex the mind. But when we behold him, as the sinner's Surety, bearing the curse, we can explain why he should endure that wrath which was due to sin, that Divine justice might be satisfied, and his people saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Drought and heat consume the snow-waters - Margin, "violently take;" see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-17.htm">Job 6:17</a>. The word rendered "consume," and in the margin "violently take" (&#1497;&#1490;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;  y&#305;&#770;ga&#770;zelu&#770;), means properly to strip off, as skin from the flesh; and then to pluck or tear away by force; to strip, to spoil, to rob. The meaning here is, that the heat seems to seize and carry away the snow waters - to bear them off, as a plunderer does spoil. There is much poetic beauty in this image. The "snow-waters" here mean the waters that are produced by the melting of the snow on the hills, and which swell the rivulets in the valleys below. Those waters, Job says, are borne along in rivulets over the burning sands, until the drought and heat absorb them all, and they vanish away; see the beautiful description of this which Job gives in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15-18</a>. Those waters vanish away silently and gently. The stream becomes smaller and smaller as it winds along in the desert until it all disappears. So Job says it is with these wicked people whom he is describing. Instead of being violently cut off; instead of being hurried out of life by some sudden and dreadful judgment, as his friends maintained, they were suffered to linger on calmly and peaceably - as the stream glides on gently in the desert - until they quietly disappear by death - as the waters sink gently in the sands or evaporate in the air. The whole description is that of a peaceful death as contradistinguished from one of violence.<p>So doth the grave those who have sinned - There is a wonderful terseness and energy in the original words here, which is very feebly expressed by our translation. The Hebrew is (&#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;  she'o&#770;l cha&#770;t&#803;a&#770;'u&#770;) "the grave, they have sinned." The sense is correctly expressed in the common version. The meaning is, that they who have sinned die in the same quiet and gentle manner with which waters vanish in the desert. By those who have sinned, Job means those to whom he had just referred - robbers, adulterers, murderers, etc., and the sense of the whole is, that they died a calm and peaceful death; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>, where he advances the same sentiment as here. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Arabian image; melted snow, as contrasted with the living fountain, quickly dries up in the sunburnt sand, not leaving a trace behind (Job 6:16-18). The Hebrew is terse and elliptical to express the swift and utter destruction of the godless; (so) "the grave&#8212;they have sinned!"<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As the snow, though it doth for a time lie upon the ground, yet at last is dissolved into water by the heat of the season, and that water quickly swallowed up by the earth when it is dry and thirsty; so ungodly sinners, though they live and prosper for a season, yet at last they shall go into the grave, which will consume them, together with all their hopes and comforts; their jolly life is attended with a sad, and ofttimes sudden and violent, death; not with such a death as the godly die, which perfects them and brings them to happiness, but with a consuming and never-dying death. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Drought and heat consume the snow waters,.... Melt the snow into water, and dry up that, which is done easily, quickly, and suddenly: <p>so doth the grave those which have sinned; all have sinned, but some are more notorious sinners than others, as those here meant; and all die and are laid in the grave, and are consumed; hence the grave is called the pit of corruption and destruction, because bodies are corrupted and destroyed in it, and which is the case of all, both good and bad men; but the metaphor here used to express it by, of the consumption of snow water by drought and heat, denotes either that the death of these persons is sudden and violent, and in such a manner are brought to the grave, consumed there; that they die a sudden death, and before their time, and do not live out half the days, which, according to the course of nature, they might have lived, or it was expected by them and others they would; whereas they are "snatched away", as the word signifies, as suddenly and violently as snow waters are by the drought and heat; or else that their death is quick, quiet, and easy, as snow is quickly dissolved, and the water as soon and as easily dried up by the drought and heat; they do not lie long under torturing diseases, but are at once taken away, and scarce feel any pain; they die in their full strength, wholly at ease and quiet; which sense well answers Job's scope and design, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23</a>. Some render the words, "in the drought and heat they rob, and in the snow waters" (z); that is, they rob at all times and seasons of the year, summer and winter; and this is their constant trade and employ; they are always at it, let the weather be what it will: and "they sin unto the grave", or "hell" (a); they continue in their wicked course of life as long as they live, until they are brought to the grave; they live and die in sin. <p>(z) "deficit"; so some in Simeon, Bar Tzemach.

This rendering is further confirmed by the next verse. Accepting it, we must suppose Job to pass at this point to the consideration of the ultimate end of the wicked, though in ver. 21 he returns to the consideration of their ill doings. The heat and drought of summer, he says, consume and dry up all the water which comes from the melting of the winter's snows. So does Shoel, or the grave, absorb, and as it were consume, the wicked. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13  Others are those that rebel against the light,<p>They will know nothing of its ways,<p>And abide not in its paths.<p>14  The murderer riseth up at dawn,<p>He slayeth the sufferer and the poor,<p>And in the night he acteth like a thief.<p>15  And the eye of the adulterer watcheth for the twilight;<p>He thinks: "no eye shall recognise me,"<p>And he putteth a veil before his face.<p>With &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; begins a new turn in the description of the moral confusion which has escaped God's observation; it is to be translated neither as retrospective, "since they" (Ewald), nor as distinctive, "they even" (Bttch.), i.e., the powerful in distinction from the oppressed, but "those" (for &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; corresponds to our use of "those," &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; to "these"), by which Job passes on to another class of evil-disposed and wicked men. Their general characteristic is, that they shun the light. Those who are described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a> are described according to their general characteristic in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>; accordingly it is not to be interpreted: those belong to the enemies of the light, but: those are, according to their very nature, enemies of the light. The Beth is the so-called Beth essent.; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>) affirms what they are become by their own inclination, or as what they are fashioned, viz., as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Symm.); &#1502;&#1512;&#1491; (on the root &#1502;&#1512;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a>) signifies properly to push one's self against anything, to lean upon, to rebel; &#1502;&#1512;&#1491; therefore signifies one who strives against another, one who is obstinate (like the Arabic ma&#770;rid, mer&#305;&#770;d, comp. muma&#770;ri, not conformable to the will of another). The improvement &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; (not with Makkeph, but with Mahpach of mercha mahpach. placed between the two words, vid., Br's Psalterium, p. x.) assumes the possibility of the construction with the acc., which occurs at least once, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-19.htm">Joshua 22:19</a>. They are hostile to the light, they have no familiarity with its ways (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-17.htm">Joshua 22:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-19.htm">Ruth 2:19</a>, to take knowledge of anything, to interest one's self in its favour), and do not dwell (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, Jer. reversi sunt, according to the false reading &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;) in its paths, i.e., they neither make nor feel themselves at home there, they have no peace therein. The light is the light of day, which, however, stands in deeper, closer relation to the higher light, for the vicious man hateth &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>, in every sense; and the works which are concealed in the darkness of the night are also &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>), in the sense in which light and darkness are two opposite principles of the spiritual world. It need not seem strange that the more minute description of the conduct of these enemies of the light now begins with &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. It is impossible that this should mean: still in the darkness of the night (Stick.), prop. towards the light, when it is not yet light. Moreover, in biblical Hebrew, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; does not signify evening, in which sense it occurs in Talmudic Hebrew (Pesachim 1a, Seder olam rabba, c. 5, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;, vespera septima), like &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; ( equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;) in Talmudic Aramaic. The meaning, on the contrary, is that towards daybreak (comp. &#1492;&#1489;&#1511;&#1512; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-3.htm">Genesis 44:3</a>), therefore with early morning, the murderer rises up, to go about his work, which veils itself in darkness (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8-10</a>) by day, viz., to slay (comp. on &#1497;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;...&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, Ges. 142, 3, c) the unfortunate and the poor, who pass by defenceless and alone. One has to supply the idea of the ambush in which the waylayer lies in wait; and it is certainly inconvenient that it is not expressed.<p>The antithesis &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>, shows that nothing but primo mane is meant by &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. He who in the day-time goes forth to murder and plunder, at night commits petty thefts, where no one whom he could attack passes by. Stickel translates: to slay the poor and wretched, and in the night to play the thief; but then the subjunctivus &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; ought to precede (vid., e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>), and in general it cannot be proved without straining it, that the voluntative form of the future everywhere has a modal signification. Moreover, here &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; does not differ from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>, but is only a poetic shorter form for &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;: in the night he is like a thief, i.e., plays the part of the thief. And the adulterer's eye observes the darkness of evening (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-9.htm">Proverbs 7:9</a>), i.e., watches closely for its coming on (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, in the usual signification observare, to be on the watch, to take care, observe anxiously), since he hopes to render himself invisible; and that he may not be recognised even if seen, he puts on a mask. &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is something by which his countenance is rendered unrecognisable (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), like the Arab. sitr, sita&#770;reh, a curtain, veil, therefore a veil for the face, or, as we say in one word borrowed from the Arabic mascharat, a farce (masquerade): the mask, but not in the proper sense.<p>(Note: The mask was perhaps never known in Palestine and Syria; &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is the mend&#305;&#770;l or women's veil, which in the present day (in Hauran exclusively) is called sitr, and is worn over the face by all married women in the towns, while in the country it is worn hanging down the back, and is only drawn over the face in the presence of a stranger. If this explanation is correct the poet means to say that the adulterer, in order to remain undiscovered, wears women's clothes comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>; and, in fact, in the Syrian towns (the figure is taken from town-life) women's clothing is always chosen for that kind of forbidden nocturnal undertaking, i.e., the man disguises himself in an &#305;&#770;za&#770;r, which covers him from head to foot, takes the mend&#305;&#770;l, and goes with a lantern (without which at night every person is seized by the street watchman as a suspicious person) unhindered into a strange house. - Wetzst.) </body></html>
