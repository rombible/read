See what pains those take, who make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it: pains to compass, and then to hide that which will end in death and hell at last. Less pains would mortify and crucify the flesh, and be life and heaven at last. Shame came in with sin, and everlasting shame is at the end of it. See the misery of sinners; they are exposed to continual frights: yet see their folly; they are afraid of coming under the eye of men, but have no dread of God's eye, which is always upon them: they are not afraid of doing things which they are afraid of being known to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death - They dread the light as one does usually the deepest darkness. The morning or light would reveal their deeds of wickedness, and they therefore avoid it.<p>As the shadow of death - As the deepest darkness; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-5.htm">Job 3:5</a>.<p>If one know them - If they are recognized. Or, more probably, this means "they," that is, each one of them, "are familiar with the terrors of the shadow of death," or with the deepest darkness. By this rendering the common signification of the word (&#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;  yak&#305;&#770;yr) will be retained, and the translation will accord with the general sense of the passage. The meaning is, that they are familiar with the blackest night. They do not dread it. They dread only the light of day. To others the darkness is terrible; to them it is familiar. The word rendered "shadow of death" in the latter part of this verse, is the same as in the former. It may mean in both places the gloomy night that resembles the shadow, of death. Such a night is "terrible" to most people, to them it is familiar, and they feel secure only when its deep shades are round about them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

Rather, "They know well (are familiar with) the terrors of," &c. [Umbreit]. Or, as Maurer, "They know the terrors of (this) darkness," namely, of morning, the light, which is as terrible to them as darkness ("the shadow of death") is to other men.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As the shadow of death, </span> i.e. terrible and hateful, because it both discovers them and hinders their practices.

It is as disagreeable, and as hateful, and as terrible to them as the grossest and thickest darkness can be to others. The word is to be rendered either "alike" or "altogether", and not "even", as in our version: "the morning is to them equally" or "together" (w); that is, to the murderer, robber, thief, adulterer, and housebreaker, "as the shadow of death"; alike disagreeable to them all; or "the shadow of death is to them together" or "alike as the morning"; what the morning is to others, exceeding pleasant and delightful, that to them is the shadow of death, or the darkest night; they love darkness rather than light: <p>if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death; they are frightened unto death, they are in as great terror as a man is to whom death is the king of terrors; and who is sensible of the near approach of it, the plain and manifest symptoms of it being upon him: this is the case of the murderer, adulterer, and thief, when they are caught in the fact; or are known by such who are capable of giving notice of them, detecting them, and bearing witness against them: or "he", each and everyone of these, "knows the terrors of the shadow of death" (x); the darkest night, which strikes terrors into others, is known by them, is delighted in by them, is familiar with them, and friendly to them, and is as pleasing as the brightest day to others. <p>(w) Pariter, Pagninus, Montanus, &amp;c.

They hate the morning light. It is associated in their minds with the idea of detection; for when it breaks in upon them unexpectedly in the midst of their ill deeds, detection commonly follows; and detection is a true "shadow of death," for it commonly means the gallows.

Heidenheim (in a MS annotation to Kimchi's Lex.) accordingly badly interprets: they plunder from the spoil of the orphan; Ramban better: from the ruin, i.e., the shattered patrimony; both appeal to the Targum, which translates &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1494;&#1514; &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501;, like the Syriac version, men bezto de-jatme (comp. Jerome: vim fecerunt depraedantes pupillos). The original reading, however, is perhaps (vid., Buxtorf, Lex. col. 295) &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1488;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, from the mother's breast, as it is also, the lxx (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;), to be translated contrary to the accentuation. Inhuman creditors take the fatherless and still tender orphan away from its mother, in order to bring it up as a slave, and so to obtain payment. If this is the meaning of the passage, it is natural to understand &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>, of distraining; but (1) the poet would then repeat himself tautologically, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-3.htm">Job 24:3</a>, where the same thing is far more evidently said; (2) &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, to distrain, would be construed with &#1506;&#1500;, contrary to the logic of the word. Certainly the phrase &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500; may be in some degree explained by the interpretation, "to impose a fine" (Ew., Hahn), or "to distrain" (Hirz., Welte), or "to oppress with fines" (Schlottm.); but violence is thus done to the usage of the language, which is better satisfied by the explanation of Ralbag (among modern expositors, Ges., Arnh., Vaih., Stick., Hlgst.): and what the unfortunate one possesses they seize; but this &#1506;&#1500;  equals  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; directly as object is impossible. The passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>, cited by Schultens in its favour, is of a totally different kind.<p>But throughout the Semitic dialects the verb &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; also signifies "to destroy, to treat injuriously" (e.g., Arab. el-cha&#770;bil, a by-name of Satan); it occurs in this signification in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-31.htm">Job 34:31</a>, and according to the analogy of &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-20.htm">1 Kings 17:20</a>, can be construed with &#1506;&#1500; as well as with &#1500;. The poet, therefore, by this construction will have intended to distinguish the one &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; from the other, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-3.htm">Job 24:3</a>; and it is with Umbreit to be translated: they bring destruction upon the poor; or better: they take undue advantage of those who otherwise are placed in trying circumstances.<p>The subjects of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> are these &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, who are made serfs, and become objects of merciless oppression, and the poet here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> indeed repeats what he has already said almost word for word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-7.htm">Job 24:7</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-19.htm">Job 31:19</a>); but there the nakedness was the general calamity of a race oppressed by subjugation, here it is the consequence of the sin of merces retenta laborum, which cries aloud to heaven, practised on those of their own race: they slink away (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>) naked (nude), without (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;  equals  &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, as perhaps sine  equals  absque) clothing, and while suffering hunger they carry the sheaves (since their masters deny them what, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>, shall not be withheld even from the beasts). Between their walls (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, Chaldee &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;), i.e., the walls of their masters who have made them slaves, therefore under strict oversight, they press out the oil (&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;.), they tread the wine-vats (&#1497;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, lacus), and suffer thirst withal (fut. consec. according to Ew. 342, a), without being allowed to quench their thirst from the must which runs out of the presses (&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, torcularia, from which the verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is here transferred to the vats). Bttch. translates: between their rows of trees, without being able to reach out right or left; but that is least of all suitable with the olives. Carey correctly explains: "the factories or the garden enclosures of these cruel slaveholders." This reference of the word to the wall of the enclosure is more suitable than to walls of the press-house in particular. From tyrannical oppression in the country, <p>(Note: Brentius here remarks: Quantum igitur judicium in eos futurum est, qui in homines ejusdem carnis, ejusdem patriae, ejusdem fidei, ejusdem Christi committunt quod nec in bruta animalia committendum est, quod malum in Germania frequentissimum est.
