See what pains those take, who make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it: pains to compass, and then to hide that which will end in death and hell at last. Less pains would mortify and crucify the flesh, and be life and heaven at last. Shame came in with sin, and everlasting shame is at the end of it. See the misery of sinners; they are exposed to continual frights: yet see their folly; they are afraid of coming under the eye of men, but have no dread of God's eye, which is always upon them: they are not afraid of doing things which they are afraid of being known to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight; - compare the description in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-8.htm">Proverbs 7:8-9</a>, "He went the way to her house; in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night."<p>And disguiseth his face - Margin, "setteth his face in secret."

So Juvenal, Sat. viii. 144, as quoted by Noyes:<p> - si nocturnus adulter<p>Tempora Santonico velas adoperta cucullo.<p>These deeds of wickedness were then performed in the night, as they are still; and yet, though the eye of God beheld them, he did not punish them. The meaning of Job is, that people were allowed to commit the blackest crimes, but that God did not come forth to cut them off. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Not of the morning, which would not give him time enough to satiate his lust, but of the evening, that he may have the whole night before him to gratify his impure desires, and that these may be indulged in the most private and secret manner; and having fixed the time in the evening with his adulteress, he waits with impatience, and earnestly wishes and longs for its coming, and diligently looks out for the close of day, and takes the first opportunity of the darkness of the evening to set out on his adventure, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7</a>; and the "eye" is particularly observed, not only because that is the instrument by which the twilight is discerned, and is industriously employed in looking out for it, but is full of adultery, as the Apostle Peter expresses it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>; it is what is the inlet to this sin, the leader on to it, the caterer for it, and the nourisher, and cherisher of it, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>; <p>saying, no eye shall see me; no eye of man, which such an one is careful to guard against; and especially the eye of the husband of the adulteress, whose raging jealousy will not spare the adulterer, but take revenge on him by an immediate dispatch of him. And few care to have it known by any that they are guilty of this sin, because it brings dishonour and reproach upon them, which cannot be wiped off: the fact of Absalom going in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>, and lying with them in the face of the sun, is the most notorious instance of this kind to be read; usually both sexes choose the utmost secrecy. Potiphar's wife took the opportunity to tempt Joseph when none of the men of the house were within, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm">Genesis 35:10</a>; and when Amnon intended to force his sister, he ordered all the men to be had out of the room, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-9.htm">2 Samuel 13:9</a>, and moreover, the adulterer foolishly fancies that God sees him not, or at least is not concerned about that; though there is no darkness where such workers of iniquity can hide themselves from his all seeing eye, the darkness and the light are both alike to him. These men are like the ostrich, which thrusting its head into a thicket, as Tertullian (t) observes, fancies it is not seen; so children cover their faces, and, because they see none, think that nobody sees them; and as weak and childish a part do such act, who imagine that their evil deeds, done in the dark, are not seen by him, before whom every creature is made manifest, and all things are naked and open: <p>and disguiseth his face; puts a mask upon it, that he may not be known by any he meets, when upon his amorous adventure, as harlots used to cover themselves with a vail, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>. <p>(t) De Virgin, Veland. c. 17. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The eye also of the <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth <i>his</i> face.</span><p>(q) By these particular vices and the licence of it, he would prove that God did not punish the wicked and reward the just.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. The adulterer waits for the “twilight,” i. e. of even. Then he disguises himself, or puts a cover on his face, that he may enter undetected the house of his neighbour.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me</span>. There is an analogy between moral and physical light, and between moral and physical darkness. The class of men here spoken of (vers. 14-16), who have rebelled against moral light (ver. 13), and refused its ways, and rejected its paths, are no great lovers of physical light. Their deeds of darkness are only suited to be done in the dark, and they wait for the evening twilight or the dusk of dawn to engage in them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>, "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-14</a>, etc.). And he disguiseth his face. As a further precaution against discovery, the adulterer disguiseth, or covereth up, his face. The same is often done by thieves and murderers. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  9  They tear the fatherless from the breast,<p>And defraud the poor.<p>10  Naked, they slink away without clothes,<p>And hungering they bear the sheaves.<p>11  Between their walls they squeeze out the oil;<p>They tread the wine-presses, and suffer thirst.<p>12  In the city vassals groan, And the soul of the oppressed crieth out - <p>And Eloah heedeth not the anomaly.<p>The accentuation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a> (&#1497;&#1490;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493; with Dech, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491; with Munach) makes the relation of &#1513;&#1473;&#1491; &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501; genitival. Heidenheim (in a MS annotation to Kimchi's Lex.) accordingly badly interprets: they plunder from the spoil of the orphan; Ramban better: from the ruin, i.e., the shattered patrimony; both appeal to the Targum, which translates &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1494;&#1514; &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501;, like the Syriac version, men bezto de-jatme (comp. Jerome: vim fecerunt depraedantes pupillos). The original reading, however, is perhaps (vid., Buxtorf, Lex. col. 295) &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1488;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, from the mother's breast, as it is also, the lxx (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;), to be translated contrary to the accentuation. Inhuman creditors take the fatherless and still tender orphan away from its mother, in order to bring it up as a slave, and so to obtain payment. If this is the meaning of the passage, it is natural to understand &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>, of distraining; but (1) the poet would then repeat himself tautologically, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-3.htm">Job 24:3</a>, where the same thing is far more evidently said; (2) &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, to distrain, would be construed with &#1506;&#1500;, contrary to the logic of the word. Certainly the phrase &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500; may be in some degree explained by the interpretation, "to impose a fine" (Ew., Hahn), or "to distrain" (Hirz., Welte), or "to oppress with fines" (Schlottm.); but violence is thus done to the usage of the language, which is better satisfied by the explanation of Ralbag (among modern expositors, Ges., Arnh., Vaih., Stick., Hlgst.): and what the unfortunate one possesses they seize; but this &#1506;&#1500;  equals  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; directly as object is impossible. The passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>, cited by Schultens in its favour, is of a totally different kind.<p>But throughout the Semitic dialects the verb &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; also signifies "to destroy, to treat injuriously" (e.g., Arab. el-cha&#770;bil, a by-name of Satan); it occurs in this signification in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-31.htm">Job 34:31</a>, and according to the analogy of &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-20.htm">1 Kings 17:20</a>, can be construed with &#1506;&#1500; as well as with &#1500;. The poet, therefore, by this construction will have intended to distinguish the one &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; from the other, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-3.htm">Job 24:3</a>; and it is with Umbreit to be translated: they bring destruction upon the poor; or better: they take undue advantage of those who otherwise are placed in trying circumstances.<p>The subjects of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> are these &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, who are made serfs, and become objects of merciless oppression, and the poet here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> indeed repeats what he has already said almost word for word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-7.htm">Job 24:7</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-19.htm">Job 31:19</a>); but there the nakedness was the general calamity of a race oppressed by subjugation, here it is the consequence of the sin of merces retenta laborum, which cries aloud to heaven, practised on those of their own race: they slink away (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>) naked (nude), without (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;  equals  &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, as perhaps sine  equals  absque) clothing, and while suffering hunger they carry the sheaves (since their masters deny them what, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>, shall not be withheld even from the beasts). Between their walls (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, Chaldee &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;), i.e., the walls of their masters who have made them slaves, therefore under strict oversight, they press out the oil (&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;.), they tread the wine-vats (&#1497;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, lacus), and suffer thirst withal (fut. consec. according to Ew. 342, a), without being allowed to quench their thirst from the must which runs out of the presses (&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, torcularia, from which the verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is here transferred to the vats). Bttch. translates: between their rows of trees, without being able to reach out right or left; but that is least of all suitable with the olives. Carey correctly explains: "the factories or the garden enclosures of these cruel slaveholders." This reference of the word to the wall of the enclosure is more suitable than to walls of the press-house in particular. From tyrannical oppression in the country, <p>(Note: Brentius here remarks: Quantum igitur judicium in eos futurum est, qui in homines ejusdem carnis, ejusdem patriae, ejusdem fidei, ejusdem Christi committunt quod nec in bruta animalia committendum est, quod malum in Germania frequentissimum est. Vae igitur Germaniae!)<p>Job now passes over to the abominations of discord and was in the cities.</body></html>
