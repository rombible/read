That many live at ease who are ungodly and profane, he had showed, ch. xxi. Here he shows that many who live in open defiance of all the laws of justice, succeed in wicked practices; and we do not see them reckoned with in this world. He notices those that do wrong under pretence of law and authority; and robbers, those that do wrong by force. He says, God layeth not folly to them; that is, he does not at once send his judgments, nor make them examples, and so manifest their folly to all the world.

In fact, &#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is by no means absolutely necessary.

The Pual &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; describes that which they are forced to do.<p>The description of these unfortunate ones is now continued; and by a comparison with <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1-8</a>, it is probable that aborigines who are turned out of their original possessions and dwellings are intended (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-19.htm">Job 15:19</a>, according to which the poet takes his stand in an age in which the original relations of the races had been already disturbed by the calamities of war and the incursions of aliens). If the central point of the narrative lies in Haurn, or, more exactly, in the Nukra, it is natural, with Wetzstein, to think of the Arab.
