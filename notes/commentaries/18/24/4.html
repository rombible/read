That many live at ease who are ungodly and profane, he had showed, ch. xxi. Here he shows that many who live in open defiance of all the laws of justice, succeed in wicked practices; and we do not see them reckoned with in this world. He notices those that do wrong under pretence of law and authority; and robbers, those that do wrong by force. He says, God layeth not folly to them; that is, he does not at once send his judgments, nor make them examples, and so manifest their folly to all the world. But he that gets riches, and not by right, at his end shall be a fool, Jer 17:11.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They turn the needy out of the way - They crowd the poor out of the path, and thus oppress and injure them.

Either, in a moral sense, out of the right way, the way of righteousness and truth, by their bad examples, or by their threatenings or flatteries; or, in a civil sense, out of the way of their livelihood, by taking that from them by which they got it; or, in a literal sense, obliging them to turn out of the way from them, in a supercilious and haughty manner, or causing them, through fear of them, to get out of the way, that they might not meet them, lest they should insult them, beat and abuse them, or take that little from them they had, as follows: <p>the poor of the earth hide themselves together; who are not only poor in purse, but poor in spirit, meek, humble, and lowly, and have not spirit and courage to stand against such oppressors, but are easily crushed by them; these through fear of them hide themselves in holes and corners in a body, in a large company together, lest they should fall into their cruel hands, and be used by them in a barbarous manner, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-28.htm">Proverbs 28:28</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> together.</span><p>(c) And for cruelty and oppression dare not show their faces.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. “Turning the needy out of the way” is a general expression for doing them wrong, hindering them of their just rights; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm" title="For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.">Amos 5:12</a>. The last clause “the poor hide themselves together” seems to sum up the general effect of the preceding wrongs. The poor, violently dispossessed of what belonged to them, or stripped through forms of law little different from violence (“for a pledge,” <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-3.htm" title="They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.">Job 24:3</a></span>), and deprived of their fields, are forced to hide themselves away from men, among whom they had formerly lived in respect, and huddle together in obscure haunts.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They turn the needy out of the way</span>. Either "they force poor men to turn out of the road when they are using it, and wait till they have passed" (compare the recent practice of the Japanese daimios), or "they make the highways so dangerous with their violence that they compel the poor and needy to seek byways for safety"  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>). The second hemistich favours the latter interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">The poor of the earth</span> (or, <span class="accented">the meek of the earth</span>) <span class="cmt_word">hide themselves together</span>. In the East there have always been superior and subject races, as well as proud nobles and down-trodden men of the same race. It is not clear of which of these two Job speaks. The former were often hunted out of all the desirable lands, and forced to fly to rooks and caves and holes in the ground, whence they were known as "Troglodytes." The latter, less frequently, handed together, and withdrew to remote and sequestered spots, where they might hope to live unmolested by their oppressors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-38.htm">Hebrews 11:38</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14  For He accomplisheth that which is appointed for me,<p>And much of a like kind is with Him.<p>15  Therefore I am troubled at His presence;<p>If I consider it, I am afraid of Him.<p>16  And God hath caused my heart to be dejected,<p>And the Almighty hath put me to confusion;<p>17  For I have not been destroyed before darkness,<p>And before my countenance, which thick darkness covereth.<p>Now it is the will of God, the absolute, which has all at once turned against him, the innocent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-13.htm">Job 23:13</a>); for what He has decreed against him (&#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;) He also brings to a complete fulfilment (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>); and the same troubles as those which he already suffers, God has still more abundantly decreed for him, in order to torture him gradually, but surely, to death. Job intends <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a> in reference to himself, not as a general assertion: it is, in general, God's way of acting. Hahn's objection to the other explanation, that Job's affliction, according to his own previous assertions, has already attained its highest degree, does not refute it; for Job certainly has a term of life before him, though it be but short, in which the wondrously inventive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-16.htm">Job 10:16</a>) hostility of God can heap up ever new troubles for him. On the other hand, the interpretation of the expression in a general sense is opposed by the form of the expression itself, which is not that God delights to do this, but that He purposes (&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;) to do it. It is a conclusion from the present concerning the future, such as Job is able to make with reference to himself; while he, moreover, abides by the reality in respect to the mysterious distribution of the fortunes of men. Therefore, because he is a mark for the enmity of God, without having merited it, he is confounded before His countenance, which is so angrily turned upon him (comp. &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-10.htm">Psalm 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm">Lamentations 4:16</a>); if he considers it (according to the sense fut. hypothet., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-9.htm">Job 23:9</a>), he trembles before Him, who recompenses faithful attachment by such torturing pain. The following connection with &#1500; and the mention of God twice at the beginning of the affirmations, is intended to mean: (I tremble before Him), and He it is who has made me faint-hearted (&#1492;&#1512;&#1498; Hiph. from the Kal, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-3.htm">Deuteronomy 20:3</a>, and freq., to be tender, soft, disconcerted), and has troubled me; which is then supported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a>.<p>His suffering which draws him on to ruin he perceives, but it is not the proper ground of his inward destruction; it is not the encircling darkness of affliction, not the mysterious form of his suffering which disconcerts him, but God's hostile conduct towards him, His angry countenance as he seems to see it, and which he is nevertheless unable to explain. Thus also Ew., Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst., and Schlottm. explain the passage. The only other explanation worthy of mention is that which finds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a> the thought already expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-10.htm">Job 3:10</a> : For I was not then destroyed, in order that I might experience such mysterious suffering; and interpretation with which most of the old expositors were satisfied, and which has been revived by Rosenm., Stick., and Hahn. We translate: for I have not been destroyed before darkness (in order to be taken away from it before it came upon me), and He has not hidden darkness before my face; or as an exclamation: that I have not been destroyed! which is to be equivalent to: Had I but been ... ! Apart from this rendering of the quod non  equals  utinam, which cannot be supported, (1) It is doubly hazardous thus to carry the &#1500;&#1488; forward to the second line in connection with verbs of different persons. (2) The darkness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a> appears (at least according to the usual interpret. caliginem) as that which is being covered, whereas it is naturally that which covers something else; wherefore Blumenfeld explains: and darkness has not hidden, viz., such pain as I must now endure, from my face. (3) The whole thought which is thus gained is without point, and meaningless, in this connection. On the other hand, the antithesis between &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; and &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, is at once obvious; and this antithesis, which forces itself upon the attention, also furnishes the thought which might be expected from the context. It is unnecessary to take &#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514; in a different signification from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-17.htm">Job 6:17</a>; in Arabic s&#803;mt signifies conticescere; the idea of the root, however, is in general a constraining depriving of free movement. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; is intended as in the question of Eliphaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-11.htm">Job 22:11</a> : "Or seest thou not the darkness?" to which it perhaps refers. It is impossible, with Schlottm., to translate <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a>: and before that darkness covers my face; &#1502;&#1503; is never other than a praep., not a conjunction with power over a whole clause. It must be translated: et a facie mea quam obtegit caligo. As the absolute &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a>, signifies the appearance of the countenance under pain, so here by it Job means his countenance distorted by pain, his deformed appearance, which, as the attributive clause affirms, is thoroughly darkened by suffering (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-30.htm">Job 30:30</a>). But it is not this darkness which stares him in the face, and threatens to swallow him up (comp. &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-12.htm">Job 17:12</a>); not this his miserable form, which the extremest darkness covers (on &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-22.htm">Job 10:22</a>), that destroys his inmost nature; but the thought that God stands forth in hostility against him, which makes his affliction so terrific, and doubly so in connection with the inalienable consciousness of his innocence. From the incomprehensible punishment which, without reason, is passing over him, he now again comes to speak of the incomprehensible connivance of God, which permits the godlessness of the world to go on unpunished. </body></html>
