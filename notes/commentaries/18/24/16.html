Less pains would mortify and crucify the flesh, and be life and heaven at last. Shame came in with sin, and everlasting shame is at the end of it.

The adulterer steals forth in the night, but it is not his way to "dig" into houses. But the persons here referred to are robbers, who conceal themselves by day, and who at night secretly enter houses for plunder. The phrase "dig through" probably has reference to the fact that houses were made of clay, or of bricks dried in the sun - a species of mud cottages, and whose walls, therefore, could be easily penetrated. In the East, nearly all the houses are made of unburned brick, and there is little difficulty in making a hole in the wall large enough to admit the human body; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-7.htm">Ezekiel 12:7</a>. In Bengal, says Mr. Ward, it is common for thieves to dig through the walls of houses made of mud, or under the house floors, which are made merely of earth, and enter thus into the dwellings while the inmates are asleep. Rosenmuller's Alte u. neue Morgenland "in loc."<p>Which they had marked for themselves in the day-time - According to this translation the idea would be, that in the day-time they carefully observed houses, and saw where an entrance might be effected. But this interpretation seems contrary to the general sense of the passage. It is said that they avoid the light, and that the night is the time for accomplishing their purposes. Probably, therefore, the meaning of this passage is, "in the day time they shut themselves up." So it is rendered by Gesenius, Rosenmuller, Noyes, and others. The word here used, and rendered "marked" (&#1495;&#1514;&#1501;  cha&#770;tham), means to seal, to seal up; and hence, the idea of shutting up, or making fast; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>, note. Hence, it may mean to shut up close as if one was locked in; and the idea here is, that in the day-time they shut themselves up close in their places of concealment, and went forth to their depredations in the night.<p>They know not the light - They do not see the light.

Which some understand of adulterers last mentioned, who, having observed where beautiful women dwell, mark their houses, and the way to them, and the best way into them, and in the dark get in at windows, or by breaking open doors get to the persons they lust after; but as such steps would be neither safe nor prudent, so they are not necessary; such sort of persons get admittance in an easier way, either by bribing servants, or by a previous agreement with the adulteress herself: rather this is to be understood of the thief and his companions, before spoken of; or designs another sort of thieves, such as are guilty of burglary, housebreakers, who in the daytime go about and observe such houses as are full of money, plate, and rich goods, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15</a>; and take diligent notice of the way to them, and which is the best and easiest part to get into them, and, perhaps, set on them a private mark that they may know them; these they break up, the walls, or doors, or windows, and get in at them, and rob, and plunder, and carry off all they can; the same sins were committed, and the same methods of committing them were used, formerly as now; there was a law in Israel concerning housebreaking, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>; and our Lord alludes to it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>. Some render the words, "they seal up" or "shut up themselves in the day" (u); in their caves, and dens, and lurking places, and do not appear, and scarce ever see the light, and therefore it follows: <p>they know not the light; it is seldom or ever seen by them, or they do not approve it, like it, and love it, being not for their purpose; while it is light they can do nothing, that manifestly discovers and betrays them, and therefore they hate it; and in a figurative sense they know not, or do not approve of the light of nature, which checks and controls such evil actions, and accuses them of them; nor the light of God's word, or holy law, which forbids them, and therefore they despise it, and cast it away from them, and will not be subject to it; nor God himself, who is light, and against whom their carnal minds are enmity; and whatever knowledge they have of him, or profess to have, in works they deny him, and live without him, as atheists in the world. <p>(u)  , Sept.

In ancient times, burglary commonly took this form. Windows were few, and high up in the walls; doors were strongly fastened with bolts and bars. But the walls, being of clay, or rubble, or sun-dried brick, were weak and easily penetrable. This was especially the case with party walls; and if burglars entered an unoccupied house, nothing was easier than to break through the slight partition which separated it from the house next door. The Greek word for "burglar" is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>" he who digs through a wall." <span class="cmt_word">Which they had marked for themselves in the daytime</span>; rather, they <span class="accented">shut themselves up in the daytime</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they seal themselves up</span>; the meaning being that they carefully keep themselves close.

Heidenheim (in a MS annotation to Kimchi's Lex.) accordingly badly interprets: they plunder from the spoil of the orphan; Ramban better: from the ruin, i.e., the shattered patrimony; both appeal to the Targum, which translates &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1494;&#1514; &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501;, like the Syriac version, men bezto de-jatme (comp. Jerome: vim fecerunt depraedantes pupillos). The original reading, however, is perhaps (vid., Buxtorf, Lex. col. 295) &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1488;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, from the mother's breast, as it is also, the lxx (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;), to be translated contrary to the accentuation. Inhuman creditors take the fatherless and still tender orphan away from its mother, in order to bring it up as a slave, and so to obtain payment. If this is the meaning of the passage, it is natural to understand &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>, of distraining; but (1) the poet would then repeat himself tautologically, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-3.htm">Job 24:3</a>, where the same thing is far more evidently said; (2) &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, to distrain, would be construed with &#1506;&#1500;, contrary to the logic of the word. Certainly the phrase &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500; may be in some degree explained by the interpretation, "to impose a fine" (Ew., Hahn), or "to distrain" (Hirz., Welte), or "to oppress with fines" (Schlottm.); but violence is thus done to the usage of the language, which is better satisfied by the explanation of Ralbag (among modern expositors, Ges., Arnh., Vaih., Stick., Hlgst.): and what the unfortunate one possesses they seize; but this &#1506;&#1500;  equals  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; directly as object is impossible. The passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>, cited by Schultens in its favour, is of a totally different kind.<p>But throughout the Semitic dialects the verb &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; also signifies "to destroy, to treat injuriously" (e.g., Arab. el-cha&#770;bil, a by-name of Satan); it occurs in this signification in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-31.htm">Job 34:31</a>, and according to the analogy of &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-20.htm">1 Kings 17:20</a>, can be construed with &#1506;&#1500; as well as with &#1500;. The poet, therefore, by this construction will have intended to distinguish the one &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; from the other, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-3.htm">Job 24:3</a>; and it is with Umbreit to be translated: they bring destruction upon the poor; or better: they take undue advantage of those who otherwise are placed in trying circumstances.<p>The subjects of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> are these &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, who are made serfs, and become objects of merciless oppression, and the poet here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> indeed repeats what he has already said almost word for word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-7.htm">Job 24:7</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-19.htm">Job 31:19</a>); but there the nakedness was the general calamity of a race oppressed by subjugation, here it is the consequence of the sin of merces retenta laborum, which cries aloud to heaven, practised on those of their own race: they slink away (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>) naked (nude), without (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;  equals  &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, as perhaps sine  equals  absque) clothing, and while suffering hunger they carry the sheaves (since their masters deny them what, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>, shall not be withheld even from the beasts). Between their walls (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, Chaldee &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;), i.e., the walls of their masters who have made them slaves, therefore under strict oversight, they press out the oil (&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;.), they tread the wine-vats (&#1497;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, lacus), and suffer thirst withal (fut. consec. according to Ew. 342, a), without being allowed to quench their thirst from the must which runs out of the presses (&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, torcularia, from which the verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is here transferred to the vats). Bttch. translates: between their rows of trees, without being able to reach out right or left; but that is least of all suitable with the olives. Carey correctly explains: "the factories or the garden enclosures of these cruel slaveholders." This reference of the word to the wall of the enclosure is more suitable than to walls of the press-house in particular.
