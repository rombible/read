Even those who love and serve God are as perplexed about His principles of government as those who know Him not. It is to be observed that the position of the second negative in the Authorised Version of this verse renders it highly ambiguous to the majority of readers. This ambiguity would entirely disappear if we read <span class= "ital">see not </span>instead of “not see.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-1.htm" title="Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?">Job 24:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Why, </span>&c. — Job, having by his complaints, in the foregoing chapter, given vent to his passion, and thereby gained some ease, breaks them off abruptly, and now applies himself to a further discussion of the doctrinal controversy between him and his friends, concerning the prosperity of wicked people. That many live at ease, who yet are ungodly and profane, and despise all the exercises of devotion, he had showed, chap. 21. Now he goes further, and shows that many who are mischievous to mankind, and live in open defiance of all the laws of justice and common honesty, yet thrive and succeed in their unrighteous practices; and we do not see them reckoned with in this world. He first lays down his general proposition, That the punishment of wicked people is not so visible and apparent as his friends supposed, and then proves it by an induction of particulars. <span class="ital">Why — </span>How comes it to pass; <span class="ital">seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty — </span>Seeing the fittest seasons for every action, and particularly for the punishment of wicked men, are not unknown to God: <span class="ital">do they that know him — </span>That love and obey him; <span class="ital">not see his days? — </span>The times and seasons which he takes for the punishment of ungodly men; which times are frequently called <span class="ital">the days of the Lord, </span>as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm" title="Howl you; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.">Isaiah 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm" title="For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.">Jeremiah 46:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-20.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:">Acts 2:20</a>. Surely, if they were constant and fixed in this life, they would not be unknown to good men, to whom God is wont to reveal his secrets. His words may be paraphrased a little more at large, thus: To answer a little what you have so often asserted: If punishments from God upon the wicked, in this world, are so certain as you say, why do not they who are truly pious see them openly inflicted? Surely it is most strange, that there are not some certain fixed times when God arises publicly, and in the face of the whole world inflicts these deserved punishments upon the wicked. Whereas, experience shows, that these visible judgments are very rarely inflicted, and many true worshippers of God pass through the world without ever seeing any thing of this kind. Heath renders the verse, <span class="ital">Why are not stated seasons set apart by the Almighty? And why do not those who know him see his days? </span>namely, of vengeance on the wicked.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-12 Job discourses further about the prosperity of the wicked. That many live at ease who are ungodly and profane, he had showed, ch. xxi. Here he shows that many who live in open defiance of all the laws of justice, succeed in wicked practices; and we do not see them reckoned with in this world. He notices those that do wrong under pretence of law and authority; and robbers, those that do wrong by force. He says, God layeth not folly to them; that is, he does not at once send his judgments, nor make them examples, and so manifest their folly to all the world. But he that gets riches, and not by right, at his end shall be a fool, Jer 17:11.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why, seeing times are not hidden froth the Almighty - Dr. Good renders this,<p>"Wherefore are not doomdays kept by the Almighty.<p>So that his offenders may eye his periods?"<p>Dr. Noyes:<p>"Why are not times of punishment reserved by the Almighty.<p>And why do not they, who regard him, see his judgments?"<p>Jerome, "Times are not hidden from the Almighty; but they who know him are ignorant of his days." The Septuagint, "But why have set times - &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  ho&#772;rai, escaped the notice - &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  elathon - of the Almighty, and the wicked transgressed all bounds? The word &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;  &#8219;e&#770;th&#305;&#770;ym, here translated "times," is rendered by the Chaldee (&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;), "set times," times appointed for an assembly or a trial, beforehand designated for any purpose. The Hebrew word properly means, set time, fit and proper times; and in the plural, as used here, means "seasons," <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-13.htm">Esther 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>; and then vicissitudes of things, fortunes, destinies; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-30.htm">1 Chronicles 29:30</a>. Here it means, probably, the vicissitudes of things, or what actually occurs. All changes are known to God. He sees good and bad times; he sees the changes that take place among people. And since he sees all this, Job asks, with concern, Why is it that God does not come forth to deal with people according to their true character? That this was the fact, he proceeds to show further in illustration of the position which he had maintained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21.htm">Job 21</a> by specifying a number of additional cases where the wicked undeniably prospered. It was this which perplexed him so much, for he did not doubt that their conduct was clearly known to God. If their conduct had been unknown to God, it would not have been a matter of surprise that they should go unpunished. But since all their ways were clearly seen by him, it might well excite inquiry why they were permitted thus to prosper. "He" believed that they were reserved to a future day of wrath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-23.htm">Job 24:23-24</a>. They would be punished in due time, but it was not a fact as his friends alleged, that they were punished in this life according to their deeds.<p>Do they that know him? - His true friends; the pious.<p>Not see his days - The days of his wrath, or the day when he punishes the wicked. Why are they not permitted to see him come forth to take vengeance on his foes? The phrase "his days" means the days when God would come forth to punish his enemies. They are called "his days," because at that time God would be the prominent object that would excite attention. They would be days when he would manifest himself in a manner so remarkable as to characterize the period. Thus, the day of judgment is called the day "of the Son of Man," or "his day" <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-24.htm">Luke 17:24</a>, because at that time the Lord Jesus will be the prominent and glorious object that shall give character to the day. The "question" here seems to have been asked by Job mainly to call attention to "the fact" which he proceeds to illustrate. The fact was undeniable. Job did "not" maintain, as Eliphaz had charged on him <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12-14</a>, that the reason why God did not punish them was, that he could not see their deeds. He admitted most fully that God did see them, and understood all that they did. In this they were agreed. Since this was so, the question was why the wicked were spared, and lived in prosperity. The fact that it was so, Job affirms. The "reason" why it was so, was the subject of inquiry now. This was perplexing, and Job could solve it only by referring to what was to come hereafter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Job 24:1-25.<p>1. Why is it that, seeing that the times of punishment (Eze 30:3; "time" in the same sense) are not hidden from the Almighty, they who know Him (His true worshippers, Job 18:21) do not see His days (of vengeance; Joe 1:15; 2Pe 3:10)? Or, with Umbreit less simply, making the parallel clauses more nicely balanced, Why are not times of punishment hoarded up ("laid up"; Job 21:19; appointed) by the Almighty? that is, Why are they not so appointed as that man may now see them? as the second clause shows. Job does not doubt that they are appointed: nay, he asserts it (Job 21:30); what he wishes is that God would let all now see that it is so.The practice and prosperity of the wicked, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/24-1.htm" title="Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?...">Job 24:1-16</a></span>.

And this he mentions as a fit preface to usher in the following discourse concerning the manifold wickedness of men, and withal their present impunity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty,.... Which seems to be an inference deduced from what he had said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a>; that since all things are appointed by God, and his appointments are punctually performed by him, the times of his carrying his purposes and decrees into execution cannot be hidden from him; for, as he has determined what shall be done, he has determined the time before appointed for the doing of them; as there is a purpose for everything under the heavens, there is a time set for the execution of that purpose, which must be known unto God that has fixed it; for as all his works are known to him from the beginning, or from eternity, the times when those works should be wrought must also be known to him. The Vulgate Latin, version reduces the words to a categorical proposition, "times are not hidden from the Almighty"; either temporal things, as Sephorno interprets it, things done in time, or the times of doing those things; no sort of time is hid from God; time respecting the world in general, its beginning, duration, and end; all seasons in it, day and night, summer and winter, seedtime and harvest, which are all fixed and settled by him; the several distinct ages and periods of time, into which it has been divided; the old and new world, the legal and Gospel dispensation, the various generations in it; the four great monarchies of the world, their rise, and duration, and end, with all other lesser kingdoms and states; time respecting the inhabitants of the world, their coming into and passing out of it in successive generations, the time of their birth, and of their death, and of adversity and prosperity, which interchangeably take place during their abode in it; and particularly the people of God, the time of their redemption by Christ, of their conversion by the grace of God, and all their times of darkness, desertion, temptation, and afflictions, and of peace, joy, and comfort; time, past and future, respecting the church of God, and the state of it, and all things relative thereunto; and the times of Israel's affliction in a land not theirs, four hundred years, and of their seventy years' captivity in Babylon, were not hidden from the Almighty, but foretold by him; the suffering times of the church under the New Testament; the ten persecutions of it by the Roman emperors; the flight and nourishment of it in the wilderness for a time, and times, and half a time; the treading down of the holy city forty two months; the witnesses prophesying: in sackcloth 1260 days; the killing of them, and their bodies lying unburied three days and a half, and then rising; the reign of antichrist forty two months, at the end of which antichristian time will be no more; the time of Christ's coming to judgment, which is a day appointed, though unknown to men and angels, and the reign of Christ on earth for a thousand years; all these times are not hidden from, but known to the Almighty, even all time, past, present, and to come, and all things that have been, are, or shall be done therein. Several Jewish commentators (c) interpret these words as an expostulation or wish, "why are not times hidden?" &amp;c. if they were, I should not wonder at it that those that knew him do not know what shall be; but he knows the times and days in which wicked men will do wickedness, why is he silent? Mr. Broughton, and others (d), render them, "why are not", or "why should not times be hidden by the Almighty?" that is, be hidden in his own breast from men, as they are; for the times and seasons it is not for man to know, which God has put in his own power, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>; as the times of future troubles, of a man's death, and the day of judgment; it is but right and fit, on many accounts, that they should be hid by him from them; but others of later date translate the words perhaps much better, "why are not certain stated times laid up", or "reserved by the Almighty" (e)? that is, for punishing wicked men in this, life, as would be the case, Job suggests, if it was true what his friends had asserted, that wicked men are always punished here: and then upon this another question follows, why <p>do they that know him not see his days? that know him not merely by the light of nature, but as revealed in Christ; and that have not a mere knowledge of him, but a spiritual and experimental one; who know him so as to love him, believe in him, fear, serve, and worship him; and who have a greater knowledge of him than others may have, and have an intimate acquaintance and familiarity with him, are his bosom friends; and if there are fixed times for punishing the wicked in this life, how comes it to pass that these friends of God, to whom he reveals his secrets, cannot see and observe any such days and times of his as these? but, on the contrary, observe, even to the stumbling of the greatest saints, that the wicked prosper and increase in riches. Job seems to refer to what Eliphaz had said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-19.htm">Job 22:19</a>; which he here tacitly denies, and proves the contrary by various instances, as follows. <p>(c) Aben Ezra, Nachmanides, &amp; Simeon Bar Tzemach.

The speaker complains that such times and days are not appointed by the ruler and judge of the world; He fails to exercise a righteous rule; they that know Him (the godly) and look for the manifestation of His righteousness are disappointed. The A. V. <span class="ital">why, seeing times are not hidden</span>, &c., appears to mean, Why, seeing God <span class="ital">has</span> appointed judgment-days known to Himself, are the godly not permitted to perceive them? The complaint in this case does not touch the Divine rectitude itself, but only laments that it does not manifest itself to men. But the distinction is one not drawn by Job. When he complains that God does not make visible His righteous rule, his meaning is that God does not exercise such a rule. This is the thought about God that alarms him, and makes his heart soft (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-16.htm" title="Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood:">Job 22:16</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why, seeing times are not hidden from the almighty</span>. By "times" seem to be meant God's special periods of exhibiting himself in action as the moral Governor of the world, vindicating the righteous, and taking vengeance upon sinners. Such "times" are frequently spoken of in the prophetical Scriptures as "days of the Lord" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>, etc.). They are, of course, "not hidden" from him, seeing that it is he who determines on them beforehand, and, when their fixed date is come, makes them special "days," or "times," different from all others. <span class="cmt_word">Do they who know him not see his days?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> why are even they, who know and serve God, kept in the dark as to these "times," so that they do not foresee them or know when they are coming?

His foot has held firmly<p>(Note: On &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, Carey correctly observes, and it explains the form of the expression: The oriental foot has a power of grasp and tenacity, because not shackled with shoes from early childhood, of which we can form but little idea.)<p>to the steps of God (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, together with &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>, from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; Piel, to go on), so that he was always close behind Him as his predecessor (&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;( ro synon. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-5.htm">Psalm 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-5.htm">Proverbs 5:5</a>). He guarded, i.e., observed His way, and turned not aside (&#1488;&#1496; fut. apoc. Hiph. in the intransitive sense of deflectere, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-5.htm">Psalm 125:5</a>).<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a>, &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; precedes as cas. absolutus (as respects the command of His lips); and what is said in this respect follows with Waw apod. ( equals  Arab. f) without the retrospective pronoun &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (which is omitted for poetic brevity). On this prominence of a separate notion after the manner of an antecedent. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, like &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>, and &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>, is not causative, but simply active in signification. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a> the question arises, whether &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; &#1502;&#1503; is one expression, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>, in the sense of "hiding from another," or whether &#1502;&#1503; is comparative. In the former sense Hirz. explains: I removed the divine will from the possible ascendancy of my own. But since &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is familiar to the poet in the sense of preserving and laying by (&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;( y, treasures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>), it is more natural to explain, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a> : I kept the words (commands) of Thy mouth, i.e., esteemed them high and precious, more than my statute, i.e., more than what my own will prescribed for me.<p>(Note: Wetzstein arranges the significations of &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; as follows: - 1.((Beduin) intr. fut. i, to contain one's self, to keep still (hence in Hebr. to lie in wait), to be rapt in thought; conjug. II. c. acc. pers. to make any one thoughtful, irresolute. 2.((Hebr.) trans. fut. o, to keep anything to one's self, to hold back, to keep to one's self; Niph. to be held back, i.e., either concealed or reserved for future use. Thus we see how, on the one hand, &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is related to &#1496;&#1502;&#1503;, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a> (Arab. itmaanna, to be still); and, on the other, can interchange with &#1510;&#1508;&#1492; in the signification designare (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-22.htm">Job 15:22</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>), and to spy, lie in wait (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-32.htm">Psalm 37:32</a>).)<p>The meaning is substantially the same; the lxx, which translates &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;), which Olsh. considers to be "perhaps correct," destroys the significance of the confession. Hirz. rightly refers to the "law in the members," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a> : &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497; is the expression Job uses for the law of the sinful nature which strives against the law of God, the wilful impulse of selfishness and evil passion, the law which the apostle describes as &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in distinction from the &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (Psychol. S. 379). Job's conscience can give him this testimony, but He, the God who so studiously avoids him, remains in one mind, viz., to treat him as a criminal; and who can turn Him from His purpose? (the same question as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-12.htm">Job 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-10.htm">Job 11:10</a>); His soul wills it (stat pro ratione voluntas), and He accomplishes it. Most expositors explain permanet in uno in this sense; the Beth is the usual &#1489; with verbs of entering upon and persisting in anything. Others, however, take the &#1489; as Beth essentiae: He remains one and the same, viz., in His conduct towards me (Umbr., Vaih.), or: He is one, is alone, viz., in absolute majesty (Targ. Jer.; Schult., Ew., Hlgst., Schlottm.), which is admissible, since this Beth occurs not only in the complements of a sentence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>, like a shadow; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>, after the manner of silver; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>, in great number; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>, as my help), but also with the predicate of a simple sentence, be it verbal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>) or substantival (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>). The same construction is found also in Arabic, where, however, it is more frequent in simple negative clauses than in affirmative (vid., Psalter, i. 272). The assertion: He is one (as in the primary monotheistic confession, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), is, however, an expression for the absoluteness of God, which is not suited to this connection; and if &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; is intended to be understood of the unchangeable uniformity of His purpose concerning Job, the explanation: versatur (perstat) in uno, Arab. hua fi wa&#770;hidin, is not only equally, but more natural, and we therefore prefer it.<p>continued...</body></html>
