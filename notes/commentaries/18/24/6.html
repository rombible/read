That many live at ease who are ungodly and profane, he had showed, ch. xxi. Here he shows that many who live in open defiance of all the laws of justice, succeed in wicked practices; and we do not see them reckoned with in this world. He notices those that do wrong under pretence of law and authority; and robbers, those that do wrong by force. He says, God layeth not folly to them; that is, he does not at once send his judgments, nor make them examples, and so manifest their folly to all the world.

The word used here (&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;  bel&#305;&#770;yl) denotes, properly, "meslin," mixed provender, made up of various kinds of grain, as of barley, vetches, etc., prepared for cattle; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>.<p>In the field - They break in upon the fields of others, and rob them of their grain, instead of cultivating the earth themselves. So it is rendered by Jerome - Agrum non suum deme-runt; et vineam ejus, quem vi. oppresserint vindemiant. The Septuagint renders it, "A field, not their own, they reap down before the time - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  pro ho&#772;ras.<p>They gather the vintage of the wicked - Margin, "the wicked gather the vintage." Rather, they gather the vintage of the oppressor. It is not the vintage of honest industry; not a harvest which is the result of their own labor, but of plunder. They live by depredations on others. This is descriptive of those who support themselves by robbery. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Like the wild asses (Job 24:5) they (these Bedouin robbers) reap (metaphorically) their various grain (so the Hebrew for "corn" means). The wild ass does not let man pile his mixed provender up in a stable (Isa 30:24); so these robbers find their food in the open air, at one time in the desert (Job 24:5), at another in the fields.<p>the vintage of the wicked&#8212;Hebrew, "the wicked gather the vintage"; the vintage of robbery, not of honest industry. If we translate "belonging to the wicked," then it will imply that the wicked alone have vineyards, the "pious poor" (Job 24:4) have none. "Gather" in Hebrew, is "gather late." As the first clause refers to the early harvest of corn, so the second to the vintage late in autumn.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Not the poor, who are obliged to reap the corn of the wicked for them without any wages, as some; but rather the wicked reap the corn of the poor; they are so insolent and impudent, that they do not take the corn out of their barns by stealth, but while it is standing in the field; they come openly and reap it down, as if it was their own, without any fear of God or men: it is observed, that the word (k) signifies a mixture of the poorer sorts of corn, which is scarce anything better than food for cattle; yet this they cut down and carry off, as forage for their horses and asses at least. Some of the ancient versions, taking it to be two words, render them, "which is not their own" (l); they go into a field that is not theirs, and reap corn that do not belong to them, that they have no right unto, and so are guilty of great injustice, and of doing injury to others: <p>and they gather the vintage of the wicked; gather the grapes off of the vines of wicked men, which are gathered, as the word signifies, at the latter end of the year, in autumn; and though they belong to wicked men like themselves, yet they spare them not, but seize on all that come to hand, whether the property of good men or bad men; and thus sometimes one wicked man is an instrument of punishing another: or "the wicked gather the vintage" (m); that is, of the poor; as they reap where they have not sown, they gather of that they have not planted. <p>(k) "migma suum", Bolducius; "farraginem ejus vel suam", Tigurine version, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Michaelis.

Job intends <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a> in reference to himself, not as a general assertion: it is, in general, God's way of acting. Hahn's objection to the other explanation, that Job's affliction, according to his own previous assertions, has already attained its highest degree, does not refute it; for Job certainly has a term of life before him, though it be but short, in which the wondrously inventive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-16.htm">Job 10:16</a>) hostility of God can heap up ever new troubles for him. On the other hand, the interpretation of the expression in a general sense is opposed by the form of the expression itself, which is not that God delights to do this, but that He purposes (&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;) to do it. It is a conclusion from the present concerning the future, such as Job is able to make with reference to himself; while he, moreover, abides by the reality in respect to the mysterious distribution of the fortunes of men. Therefore, because he is a mark for the enmity of God, without having merited it, he is confounded before His countenance, which is so angrily turned upon him (comp. &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-10.htm">Psalm 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm">Lamentations 4:16</a>); if he considers it (according to the sense fut. hypothet., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-9.htm">Job 23:9</a>), he trembles before Him, who recompenses faithful attachment by such torturing pain. The following connection with &#1500; and the mention of God twice at the beginning of the affirmations, is intended to mean: (I tremble before Him), and He it is who has made me faint-hearted (&#1492;&#1512;&#1498; Hiph. from the Kal, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-3.htm">Deuteronomy 20:3</a>, and freq., to be tender, soft, disconcerted), and has troubled me; which is then supported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a>.<p>His suffering which draws him on to ruin he perceives, but it is not the proper ground of his inward destruction; it is not the encircling darkness of affliction, not the mysterious form of his suffering which disconcerts him, but God's hostile conduct towards him, His angry countenance as he seems to see it, and which he is nevertheless unable to explain. Thus also Ew., Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst., and Schlottm. explain the passage. The only other explanation worthy of mention is that which finds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a> the thought already expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-10.htm">Job 3:10</a> : For I was not then destroyed, in order that I might experience such mysterious suffering; and interpretation with which most of the old expositors were satisfied, and which has been revived by Rosenm., Stick., and Hahn. We translate: for I have not been destroyed before darkness (in order to be taken away from it before it came upon me), and He has not hidden darkness before my face; or as an exclamation: that I have not been destroyed! which is to be equivalent to: Had I but been ... ! Apart from this rendering of the quod non  equals  utinam, which cannot be supported, (1) It is doubly hazardous thus to carry the &#1500;&#1488; forward to the second line in connection with verbs of different persons. (2) The darkness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a> appears (at least according to the usual interpret. caliginem) as that which is being covered, whereas it is naturally that which covers something else; wherefore Blumenfeld explains: and darkness has not hidden, viz., such pain as I must now endure, from my face. (3) The whole thought which is thus gained is without point, and meaningless, in this connection. On the other hand, the antithesis between &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; and &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, is at once obvious; and this antithesis, which forces itself upon the attention, also furnishes the thought which might be expected from the context. It is unnecessary to take &#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514; in a different signification from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-17.htm">Job 6:17</a>; in Arabic s&#803;mt signifies conticescere; the idea of the root, however, is in general a constraining depriving of free movement. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; is intended as in the question of Eliphaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-11.htm">Job 22:11</a> : "Or seest thou not the darkness?" to which it perhaps refers. It is impossible, with Schlottm., to translate <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a>: and before that darkness covers my face; &#1502;&#1503; is never other than a praep., not a conjunction with power over a whole clause. It must be translated: et a facie mea quam obtegit caligo. As the absolute &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a>, signifies the appearance of the countenance under pain, so here by it Job means his countenance distorted by pain, his deformed appearance, which, as the attributive clause affirms, is thoroughly darkened by suffering (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-30.htm">Job 30:30</a>). But it is not this darkness which stares him in the face, and threatens to swallow him up (comp. &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-12.htm">Job 17:12</a>); not this his miserable form, which the extremest darkness covers (on &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-22.htm">Job 10:22</a>), that destroys his inmost nature; but the thought that God stands forth in hostility against him, which makes his affliction so terrific, and doubly so in connection with the inalienable consciousness of his innocence. From the incomprehensible punishment which, without reason, is passing over him, he now again comes to speak of the incomprehensible connivance of God, which permits the godlessness of the world to go on unpunished. </body></html>
