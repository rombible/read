If we are looked upon in the face of the Anointed, our faces that were cast down may be lifted up; though polluted, being now washed with the blood of Christ, they may be lifted up without spot.

This does not mean old age, but the idea is, that his life would be cheerful and happy.<p>Clearer than the noon-day - Margin, "Arise above the noon-day."

The idea is, that the remainder of his life would be bright as the sun if he would return to God.<p>Thou shalt shine forth - Or rather, "thou art now in darkness, but thou shalt be as the morning." The word used here - &#1514;&#1506;&#1508;&#1492;  ta&#772;&#8219;upa&#770;h is from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;  &#8219;u&#770;ph, to cover - as with wings, to fly, to cover with darkness. In no instance does it mean to shine, or to be clear and bright; and why our translators attached that idea to it, it is now difficult to conjecture. The Chaldee and Syriac read the word as a noun, and render the passage, "and thy darkness shall be as the aurora." The Vulgate renders it, "and meridian splendor, as it were, shall arise upon thee at the evening." The Septuagint, "and thy prayer shall be like the morning star, and life shall rise upon thee from noon-day." The sense in the Hebrew is plain. He was then in darkness. Clouds and calamities were round about him, but if he would return to God, he would be permitted to enjoy a bright day of prosperity. Such a day would return to him like the morning after a long and gloomy night. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. age&#8212;days of life.<p>the noon-day&#8212;namely, of thy former prosperity; which, in the poet's image, had gone on increasing, until it reached its height, as the sun rises higher and higher until it reaches the meridian (Pr 4:18).<p>shine forth&#8212;rather, "though now in darkness, thou shall be as the morning"; or, "thy darkness (if any dark shade should arise on thee, it) shall be as the morning" (only the dullness of morning twilight, not nocturnal darkness) [Umbreit].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thine age, </span> i.e. the remainder of thy life and time in this world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall be clearer, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">shall arise</span>.

"Thy light," as Professor Lee explains, "shall gradually rise and expand itself far and wide."

One might almost imagine that Zophar looks upon himself and the other two friends as forming such an "assembly:" they cannot justify him in opposition to God, since He accounts him guilty. God's mode of trial is summary, because infallible: He knows altogether &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, people who hypocritically disguise their moral nothingness (on this idea, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4</a>); and sees (looks through) &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (from the root n, to breathe), otherwise grief, with which one pants, in a moral sense worthlessness, without any trace whatever of worth or substance. He knows and sees this moral wretchedness at once, and need not first of all reflect upon it: non opus habet, as Abenezra has correctly explained, ut diu consideret (comp. the like thought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-23.htm">Job 34:23</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> has been variously misinterpreted. Gesenius in his Handwrterbuch<p>(Note: Vid., Lexicon, Engl. edition, s.v. &#1500;&#1489;&#1489; Niphal. - Tr.)<p>translates: but man is empty and void of understanding; but this is contrary to the accentuation, according to which &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; together form the subject. Olshausen translates better: an empty man, on the other hand, is without heart; but the fut. cannot be exactly so used, and if we consider that Piel has never properly a privative meaning, though sometimes a privative idea (as e.g., &#1505;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;, operam consumere in lapidos, scil. ejiciendos), we must regard a privative Niphal as likewise inadmissible. Stickel translates peculiarly: the man devoid of understanding is enraged against God; but this is opposed to the manifest correlation of &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1489; and &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;, which does not indicate the antithesis of an empty and sulky person (Bttcher): the former rather signifies empty, and the latter to acquire heart or marrow (Heidenheim, &#1500;&#1489; &#1497;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;), so that &#1500;&#1489; fills up the hollow space. Hirzel's rendering partly bears out the requirement of this correlation: man has understanding like a hollow pate; but this explanation, like that of Gesenius, violates the accentuation, and produces an affected witticism. The explanation which regards <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> as descriptive of the wholesome effect of the discipline of the divine judgments (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>) is far better; it does not violate the accent, and moreover is more in accordance with the future form: the empty one becomes discerning thereby, the rough, humane (thus recently Ewald, Heiligst., Schlottm.); but according to this explanation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> is not connected with what immediately precedes, nor is the peculiarity of the expression fully brought out. Hupfeld opens up another way of interpreting the passage when he remarks, nil dicto facilius et simplicius; he understands <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>: But man is furnished with an empty heart, i.e., receives at his birth an empty undiscerning heart, and man is born as a wild ass's colt, i.e., as stupid and obstinate. This thought is satisfactorily connected with the preceding; but here also &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1489; is taken as predicate in violation of the accentuation, nor is justice done to the correlation above referred to, and the whole sentence is referred to the portion of man at his birth, in opposition to the impression conveyed by the use of the fut. Oehler appears to us to have recognised the right sense: But an empty man is as little endowed with sense, as that a wild ass should ever be born as man - be, so to speak, born again and become a man.<p>(Note: Wetzstein explains: "But a man that barks like a dog (i.e., rages shamelessly) can become sensible, and a young wild ass (i.e., the wildest and roughest creature) be born again as a man (i.e., become gentle and civilised)," from &#1504;&#1489;&#1489;  equals  &#1504;&#1489;&#1495;, since &#1504;&#1489;&#1495; is the commoner word for "barking" in the Syrian towns and villages, and &#1504;&#1489;&#1489;, on the other hand, is used among those who dwelt in tents. But we must then point it &#1504;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, and the antithesis &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489; is more favourable the Hebrew meaning, "hollowed out, empty.")<p>The waw in &#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is just like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>, and brings into close connection the things that are to be compared, as in the form of emblematic proverbs (vid., Herzog's Real Encyklopdie, xiv. 696): the one will happen not earlier than, and as little as, the other. The Niphal &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a> signifies to become manifest, here borders on the notion of regenerari; a regeneration would be necessary if the wild ass should become human, - a regeneration which is inconceivable. It is by nature refractory, and especially when young (&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; from Arab. &#8219;a&#770;r, fut. i in the signification vagari, huc illuc discurrere, of a young, restless, wild, frisking animal). Just so, says Zophar, the vacuum in an empty man is incapable of being filled up, - a side hit at Job, which rebounds on Zophar himself; for the dogma of the friends, which forms the sole contents of their hollowness, can indeed not fill with brightness and peace a heart that is passing through conflict. The peculiarity of the expression is no longer unintelligible; Zophar is the most impassioned of the three friends. </body></html>
