He represented him as a man that loved to hear himself speak, though he could say nothing to the purpose, and as a man that maintained falsehoods. He desired God would show Job that less punishment was exacted than he deserved. We are ready, with much assurance, to call God to act in our quarrels, and to think that if he would but speak, he would take our part. We ought to leave all disputes to the judgment of God, which we are sure is according to truth; but those are not always right who are most forward to appeal to the Divine judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Should thy lies - Margin, "devices." Rosenmuller renders this, "should men bear thy boastings with silence?" Dr. Good, "before thee would man-kind keep silence?" Vulgate, "tibi soli tacebunt homines?" "Shall men be silent before thee alone? The Septuagint tenders the whole passage, "he who speaketh much should also hear in turn; else the fine speaker (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  eulalos) thinketh himself just. - Blessed be the short-lived offspring of woman. Be not profuse of words, for there is no one that judges against thee, and do not say that I am pure in works and blameless before him?" How this was made out of the Hebrew, or what is its exact sense, I am unable to say. There can be no doubt, I think, that our present translation is altogether too harsh, and that Zophar by no means designs to charge Job with uttering lies. The Hebrew word commonly used for lies, is wholly different from that which is used here. The word here (&#1489;&#1491;  bad) denotes properly "separation;" then a part; and in various combinations as a preposition, "alone separate." "besides." Then the noun means empty talk, vain boasting; and then it may denote lies or falsehood. The leading idea is that of separation or of remoteness from anything, as from prudence, wisdom, propriety, or truth. It is a general term, like our word "bad," which I presume has been derived from this Hebrew word (&#1489;&#1491;  bad), or from the Arabic "bad." In the plural (&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;  bad&#305;&#770;ym) it is rendered "liars" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-36.htm">Jeremiah 50:36</a>; "lies" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-3.htm">Job 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-30.htm">Jeremiah 48:30</a>; and "parts" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>. It is also often rendered "staves," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-6.htm">Exodus 27:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14-15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-28.htm">Exodus 25:28</a>, et sap, at. That it may mean "lies" here I admit, but it may also mean talk that is aside from propriety, and may refer here to a kind of discourse that was destitute of propriety, empty, vain talk.<p>And when thou mockest - That-is, "shalt thou be permitted to use the language of reproach and of complaint, and no one attempt to make thee sensible of its impropriety?"

By which he means, either lies in common, untruths wilfully told, which are sins of a scandalous nature, which good men will not dare to commit knowingly; and to give a man, especially such a man, the lie, is very indecent; and to charge a man falsely with it is very injurious: or else doctrinal ones, errors in judgment, falsehoods concerning God and things divine; which not only are not of the truth, for no lie is of the truth, but are against it; and indeed where the case is notorious in either sense, men should not be silent, or be as men deaf and dumb, as the word (u) signifies, as if they did not hear the lies told them, or were unconcerned about them, or connived at them: David would not suffer a liar to be near him, nor dwell in his house, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-7.htm">Psalm 101:7</a>; a common liar ought to be reproved and rejected; and doctrinal liars and lies should be opposed and resisted; truth should be contended for, and nothing be done against it, but everything for it: it is criminal to be silent at either sort of lies; nor should the bold and blustering manner in which they are told frighten men from a detection of them, which perhaps is what may be hinted at here (w); some render the words (x), "should thine iniquity frighten men?" they are not so strong and nervous as to appear unanswerable, and deter men from undertaking a reply unto them: <p>and, when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? here Job is represented as a mocker of God, which is inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>; and at his friends, and the arguments they used, and the advice they gave, which is concluded from his words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a>; and as one hardened, who was not, and could not be made ashamed of what he had said against either, by anything that had been offered for his reproof and conviction: to make a mock of God, or a jest of divine things, or scoff at good men, is very bad; indeed it is the character of the worst of men; and such should be made ashamed, if possible, by exposing their sin and folly; and if not here, they will be covered with shame hereafter, when they shall appear before God, the Judge of all, who will not be mocked, and shall see the saints at the right hand of Christ, whom they have jeered and scoffed at: but this was not Job's true character; he was no mocker of God nor of good men; in this he was wronged and injured, and had nothing of this sort to be made ashamed of. <p>(u) So Ben Melech.

We must neither with the Targ. translate: are not my days few, and vanishing away? nor with Oetinger: will not my fewness of days cease? Both are contrary to the correct accentuation. Olshausen thinks it remarkable that there is not a weaker pausal accent to &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;; but such a one is really indirectly there, for Munach is here equivalent to Dech, from which it is formed (vid., the rule in Comm. ber den Psalter, ii. 504). Accordingly, Seb. Schmid correctly translates: nonne parum dies mei? ideo cessa. The Keri substitutes the precative form of expression for the optative: cease then, turn away from me then (imper. consec. with waw of the result, Ewald, 235, a); comp. the precative conclusion to the speech, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-16.htm">Job 7:16</a>., but there is no real reason for changing the optative form of the text. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; (voluntative for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-33.htm">Job 9:33</a>) may be supplemented by &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; ,&#1508;, or &#1500;&#1489;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>) (not, however, with Hirz., &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1493;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>, which is too far-fetched for the usage of the language, or with Bttch., &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;, copias suas); &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; can however, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>, signify to turn one's self to, se disponere  equals  to attend to, consequently &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, to turn the attention from, as &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-14.htm">Psalm 39:14</a> (where, as here, &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490;&#1492; follows).<p>continued...</body></html>
