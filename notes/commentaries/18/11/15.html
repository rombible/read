He thought that worldly prosperity was always the lot of the righteous, and that Job was to be deemed a hypocrite unless his prosperity was restored. Then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; that is, thou mayst come boldly to the throne of grace, and not with the terror and amazement expressed in ch. 9:34. If we are looked upon in the face of the Anointed, our faces that were cast down may be lifted up; though polluted, being now washed with the blood of Christ, they may be lifted up without spot. We may draw near in full assurance of faith, when we are sprinkled from an evil conscience, Heb 10:22.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot - That is, thy face shall be bright, clear, and cheerful. Thus, we speak of a bright and happy countenance. Zophar undoubtedly designs to show what his appearance would be, contrasted with what it then was. Now his countenance was dejected and sad. It was disfigured by tears, and terror, and long continued anguish. But if he would put away iniquity, and return to God, his face would be cheerful again, and he would be a happy man.<p>Yea, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear - The word rendered "steadfast" (&#1502;&#1510;&#1511;  mutsaq) is from &#1497;&#1510;&#1511;  ya&#770;tsaq, to pour, to pour out, and is applied to liquids, or to metals which are fused and poured into a mould, and which then become hard. Hence, it is used in the sense of firm, solid, intrepid. "Gesenius." Schultens supposes that the reference here is to metallic mirrors, made by casting, and then polished, and that the idea is, that his face would shine like such a mirror. But it may be doubted whether this interpretation is not too refined. The other and more common explanation well suits the sense, and should probably be retained. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Zophar declares, if Job will follow his advice, he may "lift up his face."<p>spot&#8212;(De 32:5).<p>steadfast&#8212;literally, "run fast together," like metals which become firm and hard by fusion.

And this fitly follows as the ground of his confidence, because he should in this case have a clear and unspotted conscience, and a sense of his own innocency. Or, <span class="ital">without blemish</span>, as the word properly signifies, i.e. without any sense of guilt, or any shame consequent upon it, either from God or men. The ground of the expression is this, that when men’s faces are spotted with dirt, they are ashamed to show them. And Job was charged by his friends as having many spots upon him, yea, such as were not the spots of God’s children. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Stedfast; </span> or, <span class="ital">firm</span>, or <span class="ital">fixed</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

As to his mind, which should have strong and comfortable assurance of God’s favour, and of his own safety and happiness. For this <span class="ital">steadfastness</span> is opposed unto that <span class="ital">fear</span> which is incident to wicked men; who, even when they are free from actual miseries, yet ofttimes are tormented with the dread of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For then shall thou lift up thy face without spot,....

Its absoluteness is described by four dimensions, like the absoluteness of the love which devised the plan for man's redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>). The pronoun &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, with reference to this subject of the sentence, must be supplied. She is as "the heights of heaven" (comp. on subst. pro adj. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12</a>); what wilt or canst thou do in order to scale that which is high as heaven? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a> we have translated according to the reading &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; with He mappic. This feminine construction is a contraction for &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>, &#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501; for &#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1501;; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a>, &#1490;&#1500;&#1492; for &#1490;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;, and more syncopated forms of a like kind (vid., Comm. ber den Psalter, i. 225, ii. 172). The reading recorded by the Masora is, however, &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; with He raph., according to which the word seems to be the accusative used adverbially; nevertheless the separation of this acc. relativus from its regens by the insertion of a word between them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a>) would make a difficulty here where &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; is wanting, and consequently &#1502;&#1491;&#1492; seems to signify mensura ejus whichever way it may be written (since ah raphe is also sometimes a softened form of the suffix, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-22.htm">Job 31:22</a>; Ewald, 94, b). The wisdom of God is in its height altogether inaccessible, in its depth fathomless and beyond research, in its length unbounded, in its breadth incomprehensible, stretching out far beyond all human thought. </body></html>
