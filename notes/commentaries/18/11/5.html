He desired God would show Job that less punishment was exacted than he deserved. We are ready, with much assurance, to call God to act in our quarrels, and to think that if he would but speak, he would take our part. We ought to leave all disputes to the judgment of God, which we are sure is according to truth; but those are not always right who are most forward to appeal to the Divine judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But oh that God would speak - Hebrew, "and truly, who will give that God should speak." It is the expression of an earnest wish that God would address him, and bring him to a proper sense of his ill desert. The meaning is, that if God should speak to him he would by no means find himself so holy as he now claimed to be. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. doctrine&#8212;purposely used of Job's speeches, which sounded like lessons of doctrine (De 32:2; Pr 4:2).<p>thine&#8212;addressed to God.

To Job, and stop his mouth, so full of words; convict him of his lies, reprove him for his mocks and scoffs, and make him ashamed of them; refute his false doctrine and oppose it, and show him his folly and vanity in imagining it to be pure, and in conceit thinking himself to be free from sin, and even in the sight of God himself: Zophar seems by this wish to suggest, that what his friends had as yet spoke had had no effect upon Job, and signified nothing; and that he despaired of bringing him to any true sense of himself and his case, but that God only could do it; and therefore he entreats he would take him in hand, and speak unto him; as he had by his providences in afflicting him, so by his spirit in teaching and instructing him; and he adds: <p>and open his lips against thee; or rather, "with thee", or "to thee" (a); converse with thee; speak out his mind freely; disclose the secrets of his wisdom, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/11-6.htm">Job 11:6</a>, and that for thy good; fully convince thee of thy sins, mistakes, and follies: for, notwithstanding all the heat and warmth of Zophar's spirit, yet, being a good man, as it cannot be thought he should wilfully and knowingly slander Job, and put a false gloss on his words, so neither could he desire any hurt or injury to be done him, or that God would deal with him as an enemy; only convince and reprove him for his sin, and justify himself and his own conduct, which he imagined Job had arraigned. <p>(a) , Sept.

We must neither with the Targ. translate: are not my days few, and vanishing away? nor with Oetinger: will not my fewness of days cease? Both are contrary to the correct accentuation. Olshausen thinks it remarkable that there is not a weaker pausal accent to &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;; but such a one is really indirectly there, for Munach is here equivalent to Dech, from which it is formed (vid., the rule in Comm. ber den Psalter, ii. 504). Accordingly, Seb. Schmid correctly translates: nonne parum dies mei? ideo cessa. The Keri substitutes the precative form of expression for the optative: cease then, turn away from me then (imper. consec. with waw of the result, Ewald, 235, a); comp. the precative conclusion to the speech, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-16.htm">Job 7:16</a>., but there is no real reason for changing the optative form of the text. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; (voluntative for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-33.htm">Job 9:33</a>) may be supplemented by &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; ,&#1508;, or &#1500;&#1489;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>) (not, however, with Hirz., &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1493;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>, which is too far-fetched for the usage of the language, or with Bttch., &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;, copias suas); &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; can however, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>, signify to turn one's self to, se disponere  equals  to attend to, consequently &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, to turn the attention from, as &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-14.htm">Psalm 39:14</a> (where, as here, &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490;&#1492; follows).<p>continued...</body></html>
