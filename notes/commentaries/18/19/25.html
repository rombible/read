First, we must bear in mind that Bildad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/18-17.htm" title="His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.">Job 18:17-20</a>) had threatened Job with the extinction of his <span class= "ital">name and memory, </span>so he now appeals to the verdict of futurity, and with what success we ourselves who read and repeat and discuss his words are witnesses. Then in Job’s own speeches we have, as early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/9-32.htm" title="For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.">Job 9:32-35</a>. his longing for <span class= "ital">a daysman </span>to come between himself and God. Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm" title="You know that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of your hand.">Job 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/13-15.htm" title="Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.">Job 13:15-19</a>, he emphatically declares his innocence, and appeals to God as conscious of it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm" title="Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.">Job 16:19</a>, he affirms that his <span class= "ital">witness is in the high heavens; </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-21.htm" title="Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.">Job 19:21</a> of the same chapter he longs for an <span class= "ital">advocate to plead his cause. </span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm" title="Lay down now, put me in a surety with you; who is he that will strike hands with me?">Job 17:3</a> he calls upon God to <span class= "ital">be surety for him. </span>Therefore he has already recognised God as his <span class= "ital">judge, </span>his <span class= "ital">umpire, </span>his <span class= "ital">advocate, </span>his <span class= "ital">witness, </span>and <span class= "ital">surety, </span>and in some cases by formal confession of the fact, in others by earnest longing after and aspirations for some one to act in that capacity. Here, then, he goes a step further in expression, if not by implication, and declares his knowledge that he has a <span class= "ital">Goel </span>or Redeemer. This <span class= "ital">goel </span>was the name given to the next of kin whose duty it was to redeem, ransom, or avenge one who had fallen into debt or bondage, or had been slain in a family feud. In Ruth, for instance, the goel is he who has to marry the widow of his relative, and to continue his name. The various and conditional functions, then, of this <span class= "ital">Goel, </span>Job is assured, God will take upon Himself for him; He will avenge his quarrel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-1.htm" title="Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.">Psalm 35:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm" title="Stir up yourself, and awake to my judgment, even to my cause, my God and my Lord.">Psalm 35:23</a>), He will be surety for him. He will vindicate him before men and before God Himself; He will do for him what none of his professed friends would undertake to do. And as to this matter, he has not the slightest doubt: he states most emphatically that he himself <span class= "ital">knows </span>that this <span class= "ital">Goel </span>liveth. “And I, even I know; as for me, I know that my Vindicator is living, that He liveth, is a reality existing now, and not one to come into existence hereafter, though His manifestation may be a thing of the future, for He shall stand at the last upon the earth,” or, “He shall stand last upon earth” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm" title="The grass wither, the flower fades: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.">Isaiah 40:8</a>), that is, after all others have passed away and gone down to the bars of the tomb. Now, this alone is assuredly a marvellous confession. It states the reality and eternity of God. It is faith in the <span class= "ital">I am. </span>This same epithet of Redeemer is applied to God in Ps. 19:15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-20.htm" title="And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.">Isaiah 59:20</a>; in the former passage it is coupled with rock, which was the term Bildad bad applied to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm" title="He tears himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for you? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?">Job 18:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Upon the earth </span>is literally, <span class= "ital">upon dust; </span>the word is thus used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-33.htm" title="On earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.">Job 41:33</a>. This usage of the same words in the same book, where the meaning is not ambiguous, is strongly against the rendering some have preferred: <span class= "ital">over the dust, </span>or <span class= "ital">over my dust.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:">Job 19:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">For I know, </span>&c. — Job proceeds now to assign the reason of his confidence in the goodness of his cause, and of his willingness to have the matter depending between him and his friends published and submitted to any trial. <span class="ital">I know that my Redeemer liveth — </span>I have no knowledge, nor confidence, nor hope of being restored to the prosperities of this life; yet this one thing I know, which is much more comfortable and considerable, and therein I rejoice, though I be now a dying man, and in a desperate condition for this life; I know that I have a living and powerful Redeemer to plead my cause, and vindicate my person from all severe and unjust censures, and to give sentence for me: a Redeemer, whom I call <span class="ital">mine, </span>because I have a particular interest in him, and he hath a particular care of me. Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ידעתי גאלי חי</span>, <span class="ital">jadangti goali chai, I know my living Redeemer; </span>that is, My Redeemer is <span class="ital">living, </span>is <span class="ital">now </span>living, and I <span class="ital">know him: </span>I am acquainted, truly, experimentally, and savingly acquainted with him, because he hath revealed himself to me, and hath given me an understanding to know him. Remember, reader, this knowledge of him, this acquaintance with him, is absolutely necessary to thy salvation. But what Redeemer, and what deliverance, does Job speak of in this and the two following verses? <span class="ital">Answer: </span>Some late interpreters understand this passage metaphorically, of God’s delivering Job out of his afflictions and troubles, and restoring him to his former splendour and happiness in this world; it being, they say, a usual thing in Scripture, to call eminent dangers and calamities <span class="ital">death, </span>and great and glorious deliverances a <span class="ital">quickening </span>or <span class="ital">resurrection. </span>But most interpreters, both ancient and modern, understand it of Christ, and of his resurrection, and of Job’s resurrection to life by his power and goodness. And this seems most probable, for many reasons: 1st, Because a proper and literal interpretation of any passage of Scripture is always to be preferred before the metaphorical, where it suits with the text and with other passages. 2d, Because the Hebrew word, <span class="greekheb">גאל</span>, <span class="ital">goel, </span>here used, although sometimes used of God, absolutely or essentially considered, yet most properly agrees to Jesus Christ: for this word is primarily spoken of the next kinsman, whose office it was to redeem, by a price paid, the sold or mortgaged estate of his deceased kinsman, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm" title="If your brother be waxen poor, and has sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.">Leviticus 25:25</a>; and to revenge his death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm" title="And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.">Numbers 35:12</a>, and to maintain his name and honour by raising up a seed to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-5.htm" title="If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her.">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>. All which most fitly agrees to Christ, who is our nearest kinsman and <span class="ital">brother, </span>as having taken our nature upon him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a>; who hath redeemed that everlasting inheritance which our first parents had utterly lost, by the price of his own blood; and hath revenged the death of mankind upon the contriver of it, the devil, by destroying him and his kingdom; and hath taken a course to preserve our name, and honour, and persons, to eternity. 3d, Because Job was so far from having a firm confidence, such as is here expressed, that he had not the least degree of hope of any such temporal restoration as that which his friends promised him, as we have often observed in his former discourses, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-22.htm" title="When a few years are come, then I shall go the way from where I shall not return.">Job 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/17-12.htm" title="They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness....">Job 17:12-13</a>. And, therefore, that hope which every righteous man hath in his death, and which Job often professes that he had, must necessarily have been fixed on his happiness in a future life. 4th, Because this is a more lofty and spiritual strain than any in Job’s former discourses; which generally savour of dejection and diffidence, and either declare or increase his grief; whereas, this puts him into another and much better temper. And, therefore, it is well observed, that after he uttered these expressions we meet not with any such impatient or despairing passages as we had before, which shows that he was now inspired with new life and comfort. 5th, Because this well agrees with several other passages in this book; wherein Job declares that, although he had no hope as to this life, and the comforts thereof, yet he had a hope beyond death, which made him profess, <span class="ital">Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm" title="Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.">Job 13:15</a>. <span class="ital">Trust in him </span>for what? Surely, for comfort and happiness. Where? Not in this life, for that he supposes to be lost; therefore it must have been in the next life. And this was one reason why he so vehemently desired death, because he knew it would bring him unto God, and unto true felicity. And this his hope and confidence in God, and in his favour to him, Job opposes to those foul and false aspersions which his friends had cast upon him, as if he had forsaken God, and cast off all fear of him, and hope in him. But it is objected, How is it credible, that Job, in those ancient times, and in that dark state of the church, should know these great mysteries of Christ’s incarnation, and of the resurrection and life to come? Answer, 1st, The mystery of the Messiah’s incarnation was revealed to Adam by that first and noted promise, that <span class="ital">the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent’s head, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>; which, being the only foundation of his hopes, for the recovery and salvation of himself and of all his posterity, he would doubtless carefully and diligently explain, as need required, to those that descended from him. 2d, That the ancient patriarchs and prophets were generally acquainted with these doctrines is undeniably evident, from Hebrews 11. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls....">1 Peter 1:9-12</a>. 3d, Particularly Abraham, from whom Job is supposed to have descended, had the promise made to him, that Christ should come out of his loins, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>; and is said to have seen Christ’s day, and to have rejoiced to see it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-56.htm" title="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.">John 8:56</a>; and had his hopes and desires fixed upon a divine and heavenly city and country, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-10.htm" title="For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.">Hebrews 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-16.htm" title="But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: why God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.">Hebrews 11:16</a>. And as Abraham knew and believed these things himself, so it is manifest that he taught them to his children and servants, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm" title="For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.">Genesis 18:19</a>, and to his kindred and others, as he had occasion; and, therefore, it cannot seem strange that Job professes his faith and hope in these things.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">That my Redeemer liveth — </span>I am a dying man, and my hopes as to this life are dying, but he liveth, and that for ever; and, therefore, though I die, yet he both can and will make me to live again in due time, though not in this world, yet in the other, which is much better. And, though I am now highly censured and condemned by my friends as a great dissembler and secret sinner, whom God’s hand hath found out; yet there is a day coming wherein my cause shall be pleaded, and my name and honour vindicated from all these reproaches, and my integrity brought to light. <span class="ital">And that he shall stand in the latter day — </span>In the days of the Messiah, or of the gospel, which are often called the latter or last days, or times, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm" title="Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.">Hosea 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>; compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>. Or at the day of the general resurrection and judgment, which, as those holy patriarchs well knew, and firmly believed, was to be at the end of the world; for this was the time when Job’s resurrection, of which he here speaks, was to take place. So that, in these words, Job may either be considered as professing his faith in the incarnation of the Messiah; that, as certainly as he then lived, as God was in existence, and had been from eternity, he should, in due time, be made man, and stand in human nature upon the earth: or, that he should rise out of the dust, and stand up the first-fruits of them that sleep, by his resurrection. Or he may refer to the day of general resurrection and final judgment, which, as those holy patriarchs well knew and firmly believed, was to be at the end of the world; and which is often termed <span class="ital">the last day: </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day....">John 6:39-54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-24.htm" title="Martha said to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.">John 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-48.htm" title="He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.">John 12:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1 Peter 1:5</a>. Then shall Christ appear and <span class="ital">stand upon the earth, </span>or <span class="ital">dust, </span>as <span class="greekheb">עפר</span>, <span class="ital">gnaphar, </span>properly means; namely, the dust in which his saints and members lie or sleep, whom he will raise up out of it. And therefore he is fitly said to stand upon the dust, or the grave, or death; because then he will subdue and put that, among other <span class="ital">enemies, under his feet, </span>as it is expressed <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a> : or, as the Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ואחרון על עפר יקום</span>, <span class="ital">vaacharon gnal gnaphar jakum, </span>may properly be rendered, <span class="ital">The last, </span>or <span class="ital">he, the last, shall arise, </span>or <span class="ital">stand up against the dust, </span>and fight with it, and rescue the bodies of the saints, which are held in it as prisoners, from its dominion and territories. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:23-29 The Spirit of God, at this time, seems to have powerfully wrought on the mind of Job. Here he witnessed a good confession; declared the soundness of his faith, and the assurance of his hope. Here is much of Christ and heaven; and he that said such things are these, declared plainly that he sought the better country, that is, the heavenly. Job was taught of God to believe in a living Redeemer; to look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come; he comforted himself with the expectation of these. Job was assured, that this Redeemer of sinners from the yoke of Satan and the condemnation of sin, was his Redeemer, and expected salvation through him; and that he was a living Redeemer, though not yet come in the flesh; and that at the last day he would appear as the Judge of the world, to raise the dead, and complete the redemption of his people. With what pleasure holy Job enlarges upon this! May these faithful sayings be engraved by the Holy Spirit upon our hearts. We are all concerned to see that the root of the matter be in us. A living, quickening, commanding principle of grace in the heart, is the root of the matter; as necessary to our religion as the root of the tree, to which it owes both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Job and his friends differed concerning the methods of Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter, the belief of another world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I know that my Redeemer liveth - There are few passages in the Bible which have excited more attention than this, or in respect to which the opinions of expositors have been more divided. The importance of the passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a> has contributed much to the anxiety to understand its meaning - since, if it refers to the Messiah, it is one of the most valuable of all the testimonials now remaining of the early faith on that subject. The importance of the passage will justify a somewhat more extended examination of its meaning than it is customary to give in a commentary of a single passage of Scripture; and Ishall<p>(1.) Give the views entertained of it by the translators of the ancient and some of the modern versions;<p>(2.) Investigate the meaning of the words and phrases which occur in it; and<p>(3.) State the arguments, pro and con, for its supposed reference to the Messiah.<p>The Vulgate renders it, "For I know that my Redeemer - Redemptor meus - lives, and that in the last day I shall rise from the earth; and again, I shall be enveloped - circumdabor - with my skin, and in my flesh shall I see my God. Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another - this, my hope, is laid up in my bosom." The Septuagint translate it, "For I know that he is Eternal who is about to deliver me - &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  ho ekluein me mello&#772;n - to raise again upon earth this skin of mine, which draws up these things - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  to anantloun tauta (the meaning of which, I believe, no one has ever been able to divine.) For from the Lord these things have happened to me of which I alone am conscious, which my eye has seen, and not another, and which have all been done to me in my bosom." Thompson's trans. in part. The Syriac is in the main a simple and correct rendering of the Hebrew. "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the consummation he will be revealed upon the earth, and after my skin I shall bless myself in these things, and after my flesh. If my eyes shall see God, I shall see light." The Chaldee accords with our version, except in one phrase. "And afterward my skin shall be inflated, (&#1502;&#1513;&#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1508;&#1514;) - then in my flesh shall I see God." It will be seen that some perplexity was felt by the authors of the ancient versions in regard to the passage. Much more has been felt by expositors. Some notices of the views of the moderns, in regard to particular words and phrases, will be given in the exposition.<p>I know - I am certain. On that point Job desires to express the utmost confidence. His friends might accuse him of hypocrisy - they might charge him with lack of piety, and he might not be able to refute all that they said; but in the position referred to here he would remain fixed, and with this firm confidence he would support his soul. It was this which he wished to have recorded in the eternal rocks, that the record might go down to future times. If after ages should be made acquainted with his name and his sufferings - if they should hear of the charges brought against him and of the accusations of impiety which had been so harshly and unfeelingly urged, he wished that this testimony might be recorded, to show that he had unwavering confidence in God. He wished this eternal record to be made, to show that he was not a rejecter of truth; that he was not an enemy of God; that he had a firm confidence that God would yet come forth to vindicate him, and would stand up as his friend. It was a testimony worthy of being held in everlasting remembrance, and one which has had, and will have, a permanency much greater than he anticipated.<p>That my Redeemer - This important word has been variously translated. Rosenmuller and Schultens render it, vindicem; Dr. Good, Redeemer; Noyes and Wemyss, vindicator; Herder, avenger, Luther, Erloser - Redeemer; Chaldee and Syriac, Redeemer.

Moses found the office of the &#1490;&#1488;&#1500;  go'el, or avenger, already instituted, (see Michaelis's Commentary on laws of Moses, section cxxxvi.) and he adopted it into his code of laws. It would seem, therefore, not improbable that it prevailed in the adjacent countries in the time of Job, or that there may have been a reference to this office in the place before us. The &#1490;&#1488;&#1500;  go'el is first introduced in the laws of Moses, as having a right to redeem a mortgaged field, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-26</a>; and then as buying a right, as kinsman, to the restoration of anything which had been iniquitously acquired, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-8.htm">Numbers 5:8</a>.<p>Then he is often referred to in the writings of Moses as the blood-avenger, or the kinsman of one who was slain, who would have a right to pursue the murderer, and to take vengeance on him, and whose duty it would be to do it. This right of a near relative to pursues murderer, and to take vengeance, seems to have been one that was early conceded every where. It was so understood among the American Indians, and probably prevails in all countries before there are settled laws for the trial and punishment of the guilty. It was a right, however, which was liable to great abuse. Passion would take the place of reason, the innocent would be suspected, and the man who had slain another in self-defense was as likely to be pursued and slain as he who had been guilty of willful murder. To guard against this, in the unsettled state of jurisprudence, Moses appointed cities of refuge, where the man-slayer might flee until he could bare a fair opportunity of trial.<p>It was impossible to put an end at once to the office of the &#1490;&#1488;&#1500;  go'el. The kinsman, the near relative, would feel himself called on to pursue the murderer; but the man-slayer might flee into a sacred city, and remain until he had a fair trial; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6-7</a>. It was a humane arrangement to appoint cities of refuge, where the man who had slain another might be secure until he had an opportunity of trial - an arrangement which eminently showed the wisdom of Moses. On the rights and duties of the &#1490;&#1488;&#1500;  go'el, the reader may consult Michaelis's Com. on the laws of Moses, art. 136, 137. His essential office was that of a vindicator - one who took up the cause of a friend, whether that friend was murdered, or was oppressed, or was wronged in any way. Usually, perhaps always, this pertained to the nearest male kin, and was instituted for the aid of the defenceless and the wronged.<p>In times long subsequent, a somewhat similar feeling gave rise to the institution of chivalry, and the voluntary defenee of the innocent and oppressed. It cannot now be determined whether Job in this passage has reference to the office of the &#1490;&#1488;&#1500;  go'el, as it was afterward understood, or whether it existed in his time. It seems probable that the office would exist at the earliest periods of the world, and that in the rudest stages of society the nearest of kin would feel himself called on to vindicate the wrong done to one of the feebler members of his family. The word properly denotes, therefore, either vindicator, or redeemer; and so far as the term is concerned, it may refer either to God, as an avenger of the innocent, or to the future Redeemer - the Messiah. The meaning of this word would be met, should it be understood as referring to God, coming forth in a public manner to vindicate the cause of Job against all the charges and accusations of his professed friends; or to God, who would appear as his vindicator at the resurrection; or to the future Messiah - the Redeemer of the body and the soul. No argument in favor of either of these interpretations can be derived from the use of the word.<p>Liveth - Is alive - &#1495;&#1497;  chay Septuagint, immortal - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  aennaos. He seems now to have forsaken me as if he were dead, but my faith is unwavering in him as a living vindicator. A similar expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a>. "My witness is in heaven, and my record is on high." It is a declaration of entire confidence in God, and will beautifully convey the emotions of the sincere believer in all ages. He may be afflicted with disease, or the loss of property, or be forsaken by his friends, or persecuted by his foes, but if he can look up to heaven and say, "I know that my Redeemer live's," he will have peace.<p>And that he shall stand - He will stand up, as one does who undertakes the cause of another. Jerome has rendered this as though it referred to Job," And in the last day I shall rise from the earth" - de terra surrecturus sum - as if it referred to the resurrection of the body. But this is not in accordance with the Hebrew, &#1491;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;  dequ&#770;m - "he shall stand." There is clearly no necessary reference in this word to the resurrection. The simple meaning is, "he shall appear, or manifest himself, as the vindicator of my cause."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. redeemer&#8212;Umbreit and others understand this and Job 19:26, of God appearing as Job's avenger before his death, when his body would be wasted to a skeleton. But Job uniformly despairs of restoration and vindication of his cause in this life (Job 17:15, 16). One hope alone was left, which the Spirit revealed&#8212;a vindication in a future life: it would be no full vindication if his soul alone were to be happy without the body, as some explain (Job 19:26) "out of the flesh." It was his body that had chiefly suffered: the resurrection of his body, therefore, alone could vindicate his cause: to see God with his own eyes, and in a renovated body (Job 19:27), would disprove the imputation of guilt cast on him because of the sufferings of his present body. That this truth is not further dwelt on by Job, or noticed by his friends, only shows that it was with him a bright passing glimpse of Old Testament hope, rather than the steady light of Gospel assurance; with us this passage has a definite clearness, which it had not in his mind (see on [511]Job 21:30). The idea in "redeemer" with Job is Vindicator (Job 16:19; Nu 35:27), redressing his wrongs; also including at least with us, and probably with him, the idea of the predicted Bruiser of the serpent's head. Tradition would inform him of the prediction. Foster shows that the fall by the serpent is represented perfectly on the temple of Osiris at Phil&aelig;; and the resurrection on the tomb of the Egyptian Mycerinus, dating four thousand years back. Job's sacrifices imply sense of sin and need of atonement. Satan was the injurer of Job's body; Jesus Christ his Vindicator, the Living One who giveth life (Joh 5:21, 26).<p>at the latter day&#8212;Rather, "the Last," the peculiar title of Jesus Christ, though Job may not have known the pregnancy of his own inspired words, and may have understood merely one that comes after (1Co 15:45; Re 1:17). Jesus Christ is the last. The day of Jesus Christ the last day (Joh 6:39).<p>stand&#8212;rather, "arise": as God is said to "raise up" the Messiah (Jer 23:5; De 18:15).<p>earth&#8212;rather, "dust": often associated with the body crumbling away in it (Job 7:21; 17:16); therefore appropriately here. Above that very dust wherewith was mingled man's decaying body shall man's Vindicator arise. "Arise above the dust," strikingly expresses that fact that Jesus Christ arose first Himself above the dust, and then is to raise His people above it (1Co 15:20, 23). The Spirit intended in Job's words more than Job fully understood (1Pe 1:12). Though He seems, in forsaking me, to be as one dead, He now truly "liveth" in heaven; hereafter He shall appear also above the dust of earth. The Goel or vindicator of blood was the nearest kinsman of the slain. So Jesus Christ took our flesh, to be our kinsman. Man lost life by Satan the "murderer" (Joh 8:44), here Job's persecutor (Heb 2:14). Compare also as to redemption of the inheritance by the kinsman of the dead (Ru 4:3-5; Eph 1:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is the reason of his great confidence in the goodness of his cause, and his willingness to have the matter depending between him and his friends published and submitted to any trial, because he had a living and powerful Redeemer to plead his cause, and vindicate his person from all their severe censures, and to give sentence for him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I know:</span> I have no knowledge, nor confidence, nor hope of restitution to the prosperities of this life; yet this one thing I know, which is more comfortable and considerable, and therein I rejoice, though I be now a dying man, and in a desperate condition for this life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My redeemer; </span> in whom I have a particular interest, and he hath a particular care of me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> What redeemer and what deliverance doth Job speak of in this and the two following verses? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> Some late interpreters understand this place metaphorically, of God’s delivering Job out of his doleful and desperate condition, and restoring him to his former splendour and happiness in the world; it being a very usual thing in Scripture to call eminent dangers or calamities by the name of <span class="ital">death</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm" title="My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue sticks to my jaws; and you have brought me into the dust of death.">Psalm 22:15</a> 88:4,5 Eze 37:11,12 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ?

But the most interpreters, both ancient and modern, understand it of Christ, and of his resurrection, and of Job’s resurrection to life by his power and favour; which seems most probable for many reasons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. From that known rule, that a proper and literal interpretation of Scripture is always to be preferred before the metaphorical, where it suits with the text and with other scriptures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. From the Hebrew word <span class="ital">goel</span>, here used; which although sometimes it be used of God absolutely, or essentially considered, yet it most properly agrees to Jesus Christ; for this word, as all Hebricians know, is primarily used of the next kinsman, whose office it was to redeem by a price paid the sold or mortgaged estate of his deceased kinsman, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm" title="If your brother be waxen poor, and has sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.">Leviticus 25:25</a></span>; and to revenge his death, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm" title="And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.">Numbers 35:12</a></span>; and to maintain his name and honour, by raising up seed to him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-5.htm" title="If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her.">Deu 25:5</a></span>: all which most fitly agrees to Christ, who is our nearest Kinsman and <span class="ital">Brother</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a></span>, as having taken our nature upon him by incarnation; who also hath redeemed that everlasting inheritance which our first parents had utterly lost and sold by the price of his own blood; and hath revenged the death of mankind upon the great contriver of it, the devil, by destroying him and his kingdom; and hath taken a course to preserve our name, and honour, and persons to eternity. And if the places where God is called <span class="ital">Goel</span> in the Old Testament be examined, it will be found that either all or most of them may be, and some of them must be, understood of God the Son, or of Christ, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-16.htm" title="The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the middle of the earth.">Genesis 48:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-20.htm" title="The children which you shall have, after you have lost the other, shall say again in your ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.">Isaiah 49:20</a></span>. See also <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-2.htm" title="Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old; the rod of your inheritance, which you have redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein you have dwelled.">Psalm 74:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-14.htm" title="Fear not, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, said the LORD, and your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 41:14</a> 44:16 49:7 52:3 63:16</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Because Job was so far from such a firm confidence as he here professeth, that he had not the least degree of hope of any such glorious temporal restoration as his friends promised to him, as we have oft seen and observed in the former discourses, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-22.htm" title="When a few years are come, then I shall go the way from where I shall not return.">Job 16:22</a> 17:12,13</span>, &c. And therefore that <span class="ital">hope</span> which every <span class="ital">righteous</span> man <span class="ital">hath in his death</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-32.htm" title="The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous has hope in his death.">Proverbs 14:32</a></span>, and which Job oft professeth that he had, must necessarily be fixed upon his happiness in the future life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Because some of the following expressions cannot without wresting and violence be applied to a metaphorical resurrection, as we shall see in the sequel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. Because this is a more lofty and spiritual strain than any in Job’s former discourses, and quite contrary to them. And as they generally savour of dejection and diffidence, and do either declare or increase his grief; so this puts him into another and much better temper. And therefore it is well observed, that after this time and these expressions we meet not with any such impatient or despairing passages as we had before; which shows that they had inspired him with new life and comfort. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. Because this well agrees with other passages in this book; wherein Job declareth, that although he had no hope as to this life, And the comforts thereof, yet he had a hope beyond death, which made him profess, <span class="ital">Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm" title="Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.">Job 13:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Trust in him</span>; for what? Surely for comfort and happiness. Where? Not in this life, for that he supposeth to be lost; therefore it must be in the next life. And this was one reason why he so vehemently desired death, because he knew it would bring him unto God and unto true felicity. And this his hope and confidence in God, and in his favour to him, Job opposeth to those foul and false aspersions which his friends had cast upon him, as if he had forsaken God, and cast off all fear of him, and hope in him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. If this place had spoken of the resurrection of the body, some of the Hebrew’ writers or commentators upon this place, who did believe that doctrine, would have understood it so, and have urged it against the Sadducees, which they did not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. All the Jewish writers which are now extant lived and wrote since Christ’s time, when the doctors of that people were very ignorant of many great truths, and of the plain meaning of many scriptures, and very corrupt in their principles as well as in their practices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. There was a manifest reason why they could not understand this text thus, because they believed that Job in his agonies did deny God’s providence, and consequently the resurrection and the future judgment, which though it was a most uncharitable and false opinion, yet forced them to interpret this text another way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. How is it credible that Job, in those ancient times, and in that dark state of the church, should know these great mysteries of Christ’s incarnation, and of the resurrection and life to come? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 1. The mystery of Christ’s incarnation was revealed to Adam by that first and famous promise, that <span class="ital">the seed of the woman</span> should <span class="ital">break the serpent’s head</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a></span>; which being the only foundation of all his hopes for the recovery and salvation of himself, and of all his posterity, he would doubtless carefully and diligently teach and explain it, as need required, to those that descended from him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That the ancient patriarchs and prophets were generally acquainted with these doctrines is undeniably evident from <span class="bld">Hebrews 11 <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls....">1 Peter 1:9-12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Particularly Abraham, from whom Job is supposed to have descended, had the promise made to him, that Christ should come out of his loins, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a></span>; and is said to have <span class="ital">seen, Christ’s day, and rejoiced to see it</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-56.htm" title="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.">John 8:56</a></span>, and had his hopes and desires fixed upon a divine and heavenly city and country, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-10.htm" title="For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.">Hebrews 11:10</a>,16</span>. And as Abraham knew and believed these things himself, so it is manifest that, he taught them to his children and servants, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm" title="For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.">Genesis 18:19</a></span>, and to his kindred and others, as he had occasion. And therefore it cannot seem strange that Job professeth his faith and hope in these things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My redeemer liveth:</span> I am a dying man, and my hopes are dying, but he liveth, and that for ever; and therefore though I die, yet he both can and will make me live again in due time, though not in this world, yet in the other, which is much better; and though I am now highly censured and condemned by my friends and others as a great dissembler and a secret sinner, whom God’s hand hath found out; yet there is a day coming wherein my cause shall be pleaded, and my name and honour vindicated from all these reproaches, and my integrity brought to light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He shall stand:</span> I am falling and dying, but he shall stand firm, and unmovable, and victorious, in full power and authority; all which this word <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">stand</span> signifies; and therefore he is able to make me stand in judgment, and to maintain my cause against all opposers. Or, <span class="ital">he shall arise</span>, as this verb most commonly signifies, i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. He shall exist, or be born, as this word is oft used; as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-14.htm" title="And, behold, you are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.">Numbers 32:14</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm" title="So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD has laid on it;">Deu 29:22</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm" title="And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.">Judges 2:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-12.htm" title="Behold, I have done according to your words: see, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like to you.">1 Kings 3:12</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-11.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.">Matthew 11:11</a></span>. And it notes Christ’s incarnation, that although as he was God he was now and from all eternity in being, yet he should in due time be made man, and be born of a woman.

The particle  which is sometimes rendered by the copulative "and", by an adversative "but", and sometimes as a causal particle "for", should not be rendered here by either; but as an explanative, "to wit", or "namely", as it is by Noldius (y); in connection with the preceding words; in which Job wishes some words of his were written in a book, or engrossed on sheets of lead, or were cut out on some rock, and particularly were engraved on his tombstone; "namely", these following, "I know that my Redeemer liveth", &amp;c. and to this agrees Broughton, "how that my Redeemer liveth"; let these be the words written, engraved, and cut out there: by my Redeemer, he means not any mere man that should rise up and vindicate him; for the account of his then living, and of his standing on the earth in the latter day, will not agree with such an one; nor God the Father, to whom the character of a Redeemer is seldom or ever given, nor did he ever appear or stand on earth, nor was his shape seen at any time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>; but the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our "Goel", the word here used, our near kinsman, and so our Redeemer, to whom the right of redemption belonged; and who was spoken of by all the holy prophets, from the beginning of the world, as the Redeemer of his people, who should redeem them from all their sins; from the law, its curses and condemnation; from Satan, and his principalities and powers; from death and hell, and everlasting destruction; and that by giving himself a ransom for them; all which was known in the times of Job, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-24.htm">Job 33:24</a>; and known by him, who speaks of him as living; he then existed not only as a divine Person, as he did from all eternity, but in his office capacity as Mediator, and under the character of a Redeemer; for the virtue of his future redemption reached to all the ages before it, from the foundation of the world; besides, the epithet "living" points at him as the "living God", as he is, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>; and so equal to the work of redemption, and able to redeem, and mighty to save; of whom it is said, not that he has lived, or shall live, but "liveth"; ever lives; and so an expression of the eternity of Christ, who is from everlasting to everlasting, the same today, yesterday, and for ever; and who, though he died in human nature, yet is alive, and lives for evermore; he has life in and of himself, as he is God over all blessed for ever; and has life in him for all his people, as Mediator; and is the author of spiritual life in them, and the donor of eternal life to them; and because he lives, they shall live also. Now Job had an interest in him as the living Redeemer, and knew he had, which is the greatest blessing that can be enjoyed; an interest in Christ is of infinitely more worth than the whole world, and the knowledge of it exceeds all others; this knowledge was not merely speculative, nor only approbational and fiducial, though such Job had, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; but the knowledge of assurance of interest; to know Christ as a Redeemer of men, and not our Redeemer, is of no avail; the devils know him to be a Redeemer, but not theirs: men may have an interest in Christ, and as yet not know it; interest is before knowledge; it is neither knowledge nor faith that gives interest, but God of his grace gives both interest and knowledge: and such a knowledge as here expressed is a peculiar favour; it is owing to an understanding given to know him that is true, and that we are in him that is true; and to the spirit of wisdom and revelation, in the knowledge of Christ, and to the testimony which he bears; and such knowledge will support under the greatest afflictions and sorest trials; under the ill usage of friends, and the loss of nearest and dearest relations, and in the views of death and eternity; all which was Job's case: <p>and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; appear in the world in human nature; be the seed of the woman, and born of one, be made flesh, and dwell among men, and converse with them, as Jesus did; who stood upon the land of Judea, and walked through Galilee, and went about doing good to the bodies and souls of men; and this was in the last days, and at the end of the world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>; as a pledge of this there were frequent appearances of the son of God in an human form to the patriarchs; nor need it seem strange that Job, though not an Israelite, had knowledge of the incarnation of Christ, when it is said to (z) be the opinion of the Indian Brahmans that God often appeared in the form and habit of some great men, and conversed among men; and that Wistnavius, whom, they say, is the second Person of the triune God, had already assumed a body nine times, and sometimes also an human one; and that the same will once more be made by him; and Confucius, the Chinese philosopher (a), left it in writing, that the Word would be made flesh, and foresaw the year when it would be: or, "he shall rise the last out of the earth" (b); and so it may respect his resurrection from the dead; he was brought to the dust of death, and was laid in the grave, and buried, in the earth, and was raised out of it; and whose resurrection is of the greatest moment and importance, the justification, regeneration, and resurrection of his people depending on it: but this is not to be understood as if he was the last that should rise from the dead; for he is the firstfruits of them that sleep, and the firstborn from the dead, the first that rose to an immortal life; but that he who, as to his divine nature, is the first and the last; or that, in his state of humiliation, is the last, the meanest, and most abject of men (c); or rather, who, as the public and federal head of his people, is "the last Adam", <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>; and who did rise as such for their justification, which makes the article of his resurrection an unspeakable benefit: or, "he shall stand over the earth in the latter day" (d) in the last times of all, in the close of time, at the end of the world, at his appearing and kingdom, when he shall come to judge the quick and dead; those that will be alive, and those that will be raised from the dead, who will meet him in the air over the earth, and shall be for ever with him; and even then "he shall stand upon the earth"; for it is expressly said, that when he shall come, and all the saints with him, "his feet shall stand on the mount of Olives", <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>; or, "he shall stand against the earth at the latter days" (e); in the resurrection morn, and shall exercise his authority over it, and command the earth and sea to give up their dead; and when at his all commanding voice the dead shall come out of their graves, as Lazarus came out of his, he shall stand then upon the dust of the earth, and tread upon it as a triumphant Conqueror, having subdued all his enemies, and now the last enemy, death, is destroyed by the resurrection of the dead: what a glorious and enlarged view had Job of the blessed Redeemer! <p>(y) "nempe ego", Nold.

This is now something higher to which his mind rises. He desires no doubt to be vindicated before men, and would wish that all generations to come should know his claim to rectitude, when he no more lived himself to make it (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/19-23.htm" title="Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!...">Job 19:23-24</a></span>); but what he desires above all things is that he might see God who now hides His face from him, and meet Him, for the meeting could not but be with joy (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-6.htm" title="Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.">Job 23:6</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.). Job’s problem is first of all a problem of religious life, and only in the second place a speculative one. And the speculative elements in it have no further meaning than as they aggravate the practical religious trouble. A solution of his problem, therefore, was possible in only one way, viz. by his seeing God (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm" title="I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye sees you.">Job 42:5</a>)—for to see God is to see Him in peace and reconciliation. And it is to grasp the assurance of this that Job’s heart now reaches forth its hand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my Redeemer liveth</span>] “Liveth” means more than <span class="ital">is, exists</span>. Job uses the word in opposition to himself—he dies but his redeemer lives after him. The term <span class="ital">redeemer</span> (Heb. <span class="ital">gô’çl</span>) is frequently used of God as the deliverer of His people out of captivity, e.g. very often in Isaiah 40 <span class="ital">seq</span>. (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you.">Isaiah 49:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm" title="And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.">Isaiah 49:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm" title="For your Maker is your husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm" title="In a little wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, said the LORD your Redeemer.">Isaiah 54:8</a>), and also as the deliverer of individuals from distress, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-16.htm" title="The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the middle of the earth.">Genesis 48:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm" title="Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-4.htm" title="Who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies;">Psalm 103:4</a>. Among men the <span class="ital">Goel</span> was the nearest blood-relation, on whom it lay to perform certain offices in connexion with the deceased whose Goel he was, particularly to avenge his blood, if he had been unjustly slain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-20.htm" title="And Naomi said to her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our next kinsmen.">Ruth 2:20</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-19.htm" title="The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meets him, he shall slay him.">Numbers 35:19</a>). Job here names God his Goel. The passage stands in close relation with ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/16-18.htm" title="O earth, cover not you my blood, and let my cry have no place....">Job 16:18-19</a>, where he names God his “witness” and “sponsor” or representative. It is probable, therefore, that there is an allusion to the Goel among men—Job has in God a Goel who liveth. This Goel will vindicate his rights against the wrong both of men and God (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-3.htm" title="These ten times have you reproached me: you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange to me.">Job 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-7.htm" title="Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.">Job 19:7</a></span>). At the same time this vindication is regarded less as an avenging of him, at least on others (though cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/19-28.htm" title="But you should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?...">Job 19:28-29</a></span>), than as a manifestation of his innocence. This manifestation can only be made by God’s appearing and shewing the true relation in which Job stands to Him, and by Job’s seeing God. For his distress lay in God’s hiding His face from him, and his redemption must come through his again beholding God in peace. Thus the ideas of Goel and redeemer virtually coincide.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he shall stand at the latter day</span>] To <span class="ital">stand</span> means to arise and appear, to <span class="ital">come forward</span> (as a witness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-12.htm" title="The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes on him with his teeth.">Psalm 37:12</a>), or to <span class="ital">interpose</span> (as a judge, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm" title="For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, said the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffs at him.">Psalm 12:5</a>). The word <span class="ital">day</span> has no place here. The expression “the latter” means either <span class="ital">last</span> or <span class="ital">later</span>. It is used of God as the first and the <span class="ital">last</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-12.htm" title="Listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.">Isaiah 48:12</a>), but also otherwise in a comparative sense, <span class="ital">later, to come, following</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-13.htm" title="Mark you well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that you may tell it to the generation following.">Psalm 48:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-4.htm" title="We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he has done.">Psalm 78:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-16.htm" title="There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-20.htm" title="They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.">Job 18:20</a>). Here the word is an epithet of God and can hardly describe Him as the <span class="ital">last</span>, for Job certainly does not contemplate his vindication being put off till the end of all things. The expression is parallel to “my Goel” in the first clause, and literally rendered, means: and he who cometh after (me) shall stand; or, and as one who cometh after (me) he shall stand. The trans., <span class="ital">in after time he shall stand</span>, is nearly equivalent. Ewald and other high authorities render, <span class="ital">an afterman</span>, i. e. a vindicator.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upon the earth</span>] Better, <span class="ital">the dust</span>. The word does not mean earth in opposition to heaven; such an antithesis did not need to be expressed; if God came forward or interposed in Job’s behalf He must do so upon the earth. The word “dust” carries rather an allusion to the earth as that wherein Job shall have been laid before God shall appear for him—the same allusion as is carried in the words “Goel” and “he who cometh after me;” cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm" title="And why do you not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and you shall seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.">Job 7:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm" title="They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.">Job 17:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-11.htm" title="His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.">Job 20:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-26.htm" title="They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.">Job 21:26</a>, &c.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I know that my Redeemer liveth</span>. Numerous endeavours have been made to explain away the mysterious import of this verse. First, it is noted that a goel is any one who avenges or ransoms another, and especially that it is "the technical expression for the avenger of blood" (Froude, 'Short Stories,' vol. 1. p. 284) so often mentioned in the Old Testament. It is suggested, therefore, that Job's real meaning may be that he expects one of his relatives to arise after his death as the avenger of his blood, and to exact retribution for it. But unless in the case of a violent death at the hands of a man, which was not what Job expected for himself, there could be no avenger of blood. Job has already expressed his desire to have a <span class="accented">thirdsman</span> between him and God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>), which thirdsman can scarcely be other than a Divine Personage. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a> be has declared his conviction that" his <span class="accented">Witness</span> is in heaven." In ver. 21 of the same chapter he longs to have an <span class="accented">advocate</span> to plead his cause with God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a> he calls upon God to be <span class="accented">Surety</span> for him. Therefore, as Dr. Stanley Leathes points out, "he has already recognized God <span class="accented">as his Judge</span> his <span class="accented">Umpire</span> his <span class="accented">Advocate</span> his <span class="accented">Witness</span> and his <span class="accented">Surety</span> in some cases by formal confession of the fact, in others by earnest longing after, and aspiration for,  some one to act in that capacity." After all this, it is not taking a very long step in advance to see and acknowledge in God his Goel, or "Redeemer." <span class="cmt_word">And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and that at the last he shall stand up over my dust.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> is not "one who comes after me;" but, if a noun, "the last <span class="accented">one</span>" <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> is "the first one "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>); if intended adverbially, "at the last" - <span class="accented">i.e</span>, at the end of all things. "At the latter day" is not an improper translation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; is the name he gives those to whom he confides his most secret affairs; &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>) signifies either with a verbal notion, secret speaking (Arab. sa&#770;wada, III. form from sa&#770;da, to press one's self close upon, esp. as sa&#770;rra, to speak in secret with any one), or what is made firm, i.e., what is impenetrable, therefore a secret (from sa&#770;da, to be or make close, firm, compact; cognate root, &#1497;&#1505;&#1491;, wasada, cognate in signification, sirr, a secret, from sarra, &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;, which likewise signifies to make firm). Those to whom he has made known his most secret plans (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13-15</a>) now abhor him; and those whom he has thus (&#1494;&#1492;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-17.htm">Job 15:17</a>) become attached to, and to whom he has shown his affection, - he says this with an allusion to the three, - have turned against him. They gave tokens of their love and honour to him, when he was in the height of his happiness and prosperity, but they have not even shown any sympathy with him in his present form of distress.<p>(Note: The disease which maims or devours the limbs, da&#770;'u el-gudha&#770;m [vid. supra, p. 281], which generically includes Arabian leprosy, cancer, and syphilis, and is called the "first-born of death" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-13.htm">Job 18:13</a>, is still in Arabia the most dreaded disease, in the face of which all human sympathy ceases. In the steppe, even the greatest personage who is seized with this disease is removed at least a mile or two from the encampment, where a charbu&#770;sh, i.e., a small black hair-tent, is put up for him, and an old woman, who has no relations living, is given him as an attendant until he dies. No one visits him, not even his nearest relations. He is cast off as muqa&#770;tal ollah. - Wetzst. The prejudice combated by the book of Job, that the leper is, as such, one who is smitten by the wrath of God, has therefore as firm hold of the Arabian mind in the present day as it had centuries ago.)<p>His bones cleave (&#1491;&#1489;&#1511;&#1492;, Aq. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, lxx erroneously &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, i.e., &#1512;&#1511;&#1489;&#1492;) to his skin, i.e., the bones may be felt and seen through the skin, and the little flesh that remains is wasted away almost to a skeleton (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>). This is not contradictory to the primary characteristic symptom of the lepra nodosa; for the wasting away of the rest of the body may attain an extraordinarily high degree in connection with the hypertrophy of single parts. He can indeed say of himself, that he is only escaped (se soit chapp) with the skin of his teeth. By the "skin of his teeth" the gums are generally understood. But (1) the gum is not skin, and can therefore not be called "skin of the teeth" in any language; (2) Job complains in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a> of his offensive breath, which in itself does not admit of the idea of healthy gums, and especially if it be the result of a scorbutic ulceration of the mouth, presupposes an ulcerous destruction of the gums. The current translation, "with my gums," is therefore to be rejected on account both of the language and the matter. For this reason Stickel (whom Hahn follows) takes &#1506;&#1493;&#1512; as inf. from &#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, and translates: "I am escaped from it with my teeth naked" lit. with the being naked of my teeth, i.e., with teeth that are no longer covered, standing forward uncovered. This explanation is pathologically satisfactory; but it has against it (1) the translation of &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;, which is wide of the most natural interpretation of the word; (2) that in close connection with &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1502;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492; one expects the mention of a part of the body that has remained whole. Is there not, then, really a skin of the teeth in the proper sense? The gum is not skin, but the teeth are surrounded with a skin in the jaw, the so-called periosteum. If we suppose, what is natural enough, that his offensive breath, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>, arises from ulcers in the mouth (in connection with scorbutus, as is known, the breath has a terribly offensive smell), we obtain the following picture of Job's disease: his flesh is in part hypertrophically swollen, in part fearfully wasted away; the gums especially are destroyed and wasted away from the teeth, only the periosteum round about the teeth is still left to him, and single remnants of the covering of his loose and projecting teeth.<p>Thus we interpret &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; in the first signification of the words, and have also no need for supposing that <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a> is a proverbial phrase for "I have with great care and difficulty escaped the extreme." The declaration perfectly corresponds to the description of the disease; and it is altogether needless with Hupfeld, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-14.htm">Job 13:14</a>, to read &#1506;&#1493;&#1512; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, vitam solam et nudam vix reportavi, which is moreover inappropriate, since Job regards himself as one who is dying. Symm. alters the position of the &#1489;&#1468; similarly, since he translates after the Syriac Hexapla: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (&#1493;&#1514;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;) &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, from &#1502;&#1500;&#1496;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1496;, Arab. mllt&#803;, nudare pilis, which J. D. Michaelis also compares; the sense, however, which is thereby gained, is beneath all criticism. On the aoristic &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>. Stickel has on this passage an excursus on this ah, to which he also attributes, in this addition to the historic tense, the idea of striving after a goal: "I slip away, I escape;" it certainly gives vividness to the notion of the action, if it may not always have the force of direction towards anything. Therefore: with a destroyed flesh, and indeed so completely destroyed that there is even nothing left to him of sound skin except the skin of his teeth, wasted away to a skeleton, and become both to sight and smell a loathsome object; - such is the sufferer the friends have before them, - one who is tortured, besides, by a dark conflict which they only make more severe, - one who now implores them for pity, and because he has no pity to expect from man, presses forward to a hope which reaches beyond the grave. </body></html>
