What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hath stripped me of my glory - Everything which I had that contributed to my respectability and honor, he has taken away.

The metaphor of a traveller may be still continued, who falling among thieves is stripped of his clothes, to which the allusion may be: Job was not stripped of his glory in a spiritual sense, not of the glorious robe of Christ's righteousness, nor of the graces of the Spirit, which makes saints all glorious within; but in a civil sense, and is to be understood not merely of his rich apparel, or of his robe, which he might wear as a civil magistrate, as an ensign of honour, and which made him look glorious; but either of his wealth, riches, and substance, which are a man's glory, and which he too often and too much glories in, though Job might not; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-16.htm">Psalm 49:16</a>; or of his children, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-11.htm">Esther 5:11</a>; and indeed of everything that made him look magnificent among men; as an abundance of this world's good, a numerous family, fine clothes, sumptuous living, and a stately palace; all which Job might have had, but was now stripped of all by one means or another; and whoever were the instruments, he ascribes it all to God, as being according to his sovereign will and pleasure; and these things are very properly and significantly expressed by clothes a man is stripped of, because they are outward things, as garments are, adorn and make externally glorious, as they do, and of which a man may be as soon and as easily deprived as to be stripped of his clothes by one or more of superior power to him: <p>and taken the crown from my head: meaning much the same as before, either his wealth and riches, which are the crown of a wise man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-24.htm">Proverbs 14:24</a>; or his children, which are the crown of old then, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>; or everything that gave him honour, reputation, and esteem with men; all was taken away from him, and his honour laid in the dust. Some from hence have wrongly concluded that Job was a king, and wore a royal diadem, of which he was now deprived, mistaking him for Jobab, a king of Edom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>; but he had and wore a better diadem, and which he did not lose, but held fast, even his righteousness, justice, and integrity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-14.htm">Job 29:14</a>; and much less could the crown of life, righteousness, and glory, to which he was entitled, be taken from him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> crown <i>from</i> my head.</span><p>(e) Meaning, his children, and whatever was dear to him in this world.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. Then came the consciousness of the meaning of his calamitiesâ€”they were evidence that he was a transgressor.
