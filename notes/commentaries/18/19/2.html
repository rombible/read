Which of all vexation is the worst; not only his bones were vexed, but his soul also, as David's was, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>. His body was vexed with boils from head to feet; but now his soul was vexed by his friends, and which denotes extreme vexation, a man's being vexed to his very heart: there are many things vexations to men, especially to good men; they are not only vexed with pains of the body, as others, and with loss of worldly substance; but even all things here below, and the highest enjoyment of them, as wealth, wisdom, honours, and pleasures, are all vanity and vexation of spirit, as they were to Solomon; but more especially truly good men are vexed with the corruptions of their hearts, which are as pricks in their eyes and thorns in their sides, and with the temptations of Satan, which are also thorns in the flesh and fiery darts, and with the conversation of wicked men, as was the soul of righteous Lot, and with the bad principles and practices of professors of religion; and sometimes, as Job was, they are vexed by their own friends, who should be their comforters, but prove miserable ones, as his did, and even vexations, and continued so to the wearing him out almost; and so some render the words, "how long will ye weary my soul" (c)? with repeating their insinuations that he was a wicked and hypocritical man, and therefore was afflicted of God in the manner he was; and which, knowing his own innocency, extremely vexed him: <p>and break me in pieces with words? not his body, but his spirit; which was broken, not by the word of God, which is like an hammer that breaks the rocky heart in pieces; for such a breaking is in mercy, and not an affliction to be complained of; and such as are thus broken are healed again, and bound up by the same hand that breaks; who has great, regard to broken spirits and contrite hearts; looks to them, and dwells with them, in order to revive and comfort them: but by the words of men; Job was smitten with the tongues of men; as Jeremiah was, and was beaten and bruised by them, as anything is beaten and bruised by a pestle in a mortar, as the word (d) signifies, and is sometimes rendered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>; these must be not soft but hard words, not gentle reproofs, which being given and taken in love, will not break the head, but calumnies and reproaches falsely cast, and with great severity, and frequently, which break the heart.

Sir. 23:25, 40:15; Wisd. 4:3-5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm">Romans 11:16</a>), the arbor consanguineitatis, which is not Roman, but is become common in the Christian refinement of the Roman right, may be traced back; the first trace of this is found in Isidorus Hispalensis (as also the Cabbalistic tree &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1503;, which represents the Sephir-genealogy, has its origin in Spain).)<p>his complete extirpation is like the dying off of the root and of the branch, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>, and "let him not have a root below and a branch above" in the inscription on the sarcophagus of Eschmunazar. Here we again meet with &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;, the proper meaning of which is so disputed; it is translated by the Targ. (as by us) as Niph. &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, but the meaning "to wither" is near at hand, which, as we said on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>, may be gained as well from the primary notion "to fall to pieces" (whence lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), as from the primary notion "to parch, dry." &#1488;&#1502;&#1500; (whence &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, formed after the manner of the Arabic IX. form, usually of failing; vid., Caspari, 59) offers a third possible explanation; it signifies originally to be long and lax, to let anything hang down, and thence in Arab. (amala) to hope, i.e., to look out into the distance. Not the evil-doer's family alone is rooted out, but also his memory. With &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, a very relative notion, both the street outside in front of the house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-32.htm">Job 31:32</a>), and the pasture beyond the dwelling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>), are described; here it is to be explained according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-26.htm">Proverbs 8:26</a> (&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1493;&#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;), where Hitz. remarks: "The lxx translates correctly &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;. The districts beyond each persons' land, which also belong to no one else, the desert, whither one goes forth, is meant." So &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; seems also here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>) to denote the land that is regularly inhabited - Job himself is a large proprietor within the range of a city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>) - and &#1495;&#1493;&#1509; the steppe traversed by the wandering tribes which lies out beyond. Thus also the Syr. version transl. 'al apai barito, over the plain of the desert, after which the Arabic version is el-barr&#305;&#770;je (the synon. of bedw, ba&#770;dije, whence the name of the Beduin<p>(Note: The village with its meadow-land is el-beled wa 'l-berr. The arable land, in distinction from the steppe, is el-ardd el-a&#770;mira, and the steppe is el-berr&#305;&#770;je. If both are intended, ardd can be used alone. Used specially, el-berr&#305;&#770;je is the proper name for the great Syrian desert; hence the proverb: el-hhurr&#305;&#770;je fi 'l-berr&#305;&#775;je, there is freedom in the steppe (not in towns and villages). - Wetzst.)).<p>What is directly said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-17.htm">Job 18:17</a> is repeated figuratively in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-18.htm">Job 18:18</a>; as also what has been figuratively expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a> is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-19.htm">Job 18:19</a> without figure. The subj. of the verbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-18.htm">Job 18:18</a> remains in the background, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a> : they thrust him out of the light (of life, prosperity, and fame) into the darkness (of misfortune, death, and oblivion); so that the illustris becomes not merely ignobilis, but totally ignotus, and they hunt him forth (&#1497;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; from the Hiph. &#1492;&#1504;&#1491; of the verb &#1504;&#1491;&#1491;, instead of which it might also be &#1497;&#1504;&#1491;&#1492;&#1493; from &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, they banish him) out of the habitable world (for this is the signification of &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, the earth as built upon and inhabited). There remains to him in his race neither sprout nor shoot; thus the rhyming alliteration &#1504;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1504;&#1499;&#1491; (according to Luzzatto on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-22.htm">Isaiah 14:22</a>, used only of the descendants of persons in high rank, and certainly a nobler expression than our rhyming pairs: Germ. Stumpf und Stiel, Mann und Maus, Kind und Kegel). And there is no escaped one (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm">Deuteronomy 2:34</a> and freq., Arab. sha&#770;rid, one fleeing; sharu&#770;d, a fugitive) in his abodes (&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, as only besides <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>). Thus to die away without descendant and remembrance is still at the present day among the Arab races that profess D&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m (the religion of Abraham) the most unhappy thought, for the point of gravitation of continuance beyond the grave is transferred by them to the immortality of the righteous in the continuance of his posterity and works in this world (vid., supra, p. 386); and where else should it be at the time of Job, since no revelation had as yet drawn the curtain aside from the future world? Now follows the declamatory conclusion of the speech. </body></html>
