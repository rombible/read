What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My kinsfolk have failed - My neighbors (&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;  qa&#770;ro&#770;ba&#772;y), those who were near to me. It may refer to "nearness" of affinity, friendship, or residence. The essential idea is that of "nearness" - whether by blood, affection, or vicinity. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>, it denotes near friends.<p>And my familiar friends - Those who knew me - &#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497;  myuda&#772;&#8219;ay.

So "kinsfolk" and "familiar friends" (Job 19:14) correspond in parallelism. The Arabic proverb is, "The brother, that is, the true friend, is only known in time of need."<p>estranged&#8212;literally, "turn away with disgust." Job again unconsciously uses language prefiguring the desertion of Jesus Christ (Job 16:10; Lu 23:49; Ps 38:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My kinsfolk have failed, </span> to wit, to perform the offices of humanity and friendship which they owe to me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Have forgotten me, </span> i.e. neglect and disregard me as much as if they had quite forgotten me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>My kinsfolk have failed,.... Or "ceased" (a), not to be, or that they were dead, which is sometimes the sense of the word; but they ceased from visiting him, or doing any good office for him; those that were "near" (b) him, as the word used signifies; that were near him in relation, and were often near him in place, in his own house, in company and conversation with him, now ceased to be near him in affection; or to come nigh him, to converse with him and comfort him, and sympathize with him, which might be expected from persons nearly related: <p>and my familiar friends have forgotten me; such as were well known to him, and he to them, and who not long ago were very loving and friendly to him, and very freely and familiarly conversed with him; but now they forgot him; the friendship that subsisted between them, the friendliness with which they had visited him, and the favours they had received from him; they so slighted and neglected him, that it seemed as if he was forgotten, as a dead man, out of mind; or as if they did not remember that there ever was, or at least that there now was, such a man in the world as Job: these could not be true friends; for "a friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity", <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; a real friend loves, and continues to love, in adversity as well as in prosperity; and such an one, who sometimes sticks closer to a man than a brother, is born and designed to be of service to him in a time of trouble; but so it was ordered by divine Providence, and according to the will of God, that Job should meet with such treatment from his brethren, relations, acquaintance, and familiar friends, for the trial of his faith and patience. <p>(a) "desierunt", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus, Mercerus, Drusius, Piscator, Schmidt, Michaelis; "cessant", Schultens.

He finds, however, neither with God nor among men any response of sympathy and help; he cries for help (which &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, perhaps connected with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, Arab. s&#8219;t, from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, Arab. ws&#8219;, seems to signify), without justice, i.e., the right of an impartial hearing and verdict, being attainable by him. He is like a prisoner who is confined to a narrow space (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-23.htm">Job 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>) and has no way out, since darkness is laid upon him wherever he may go. One is here reminded of <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7-9</a>; and, in fact, this speech generally stands in no accidental mutual relation to the lamentations of Jeremiah. The "crown of my head" has also its parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-16.htm">Lamentations 5:16</a>; that which was Job's greatest ornament and most costly jewel is meant. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29-14.htm">Job 29:14</a>, &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; were his robe and diadem. These robes of honour God has stripped from him, this adornment more precious than a regal diadem He has taken from him since, i.e., his affliction puts him down as a transgressor, and abandons him to the insult of those around him. God destroyed him roundabout (destruxit), as a house that is broken down on all sides, and lifted out as a tree his hope. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; does not in itself signify to root out, but only to lift out (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a>, of the tent-cord, and with it the tent-pin) of a plant: to remove it from the ground in which it has grown, either to plant it elsewhere, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>, or as here, to put it aside. The ground was taken away from his hope, so that its greenness faded away like that of a tree that is rooted up. The fut. consec. is here to be translated: then I perished (different from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-20.htm">Job 14:20</a> : and consequently he perishes); he is now already one who is passed away, his existence is only the shadow of life. God has caused, fut. Hiph. apoc. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;, His wrath to kindle against him, and regarded him in relation to Himself as His opponents, therefore as one of them. Perhaps, however, the expression is intentionally intensified here, in contrast with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-24.htm">Job 13:24</a> : he, the one, is accounted by God as the host of His foes; He treats him as if all hostility to God were concentrated in him. </body></html>
