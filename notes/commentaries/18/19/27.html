Possibly not directly, but they express the firm conviction of that faith of which the resurrection is the only natural justification; they express a living trust in a living personal God, who, if He is to come into contact with man, cannot suffer His Holy One to see corruption nor leave His soul in hell. How far Job believed in the resurrection of the flesh hereafter, he certainly believed there was life out of death and through death here; and no man can believe in a living God and not believe that He must and will triumph over death. It is possible for us to believe in some dogma about the resurrection, and yet not believe in God. In this respect we shall be unlike Job. It is impossible for us to believe as he did and not be ready and thankful to believe in the resurrection of Christ, and of those who belong to Christ, as soon as the fact is proclaimed to us on sufficient authority. In this way, and for this reason, the confession of Job rightly stands at the head of the Christian Office for the Burial of the Dead, which looks forward to the resurrection, and lays fast hold thereon. Those who decline to see in Job’s confession any knowledge or hope of a resurrection, must not forget that they have also to explain and account for <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm" title="Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.

Here he witnessed a good confession; declared the soundness of his faith, and the assurance of his hope. Here is much of Christ and heaven; and he that said such things are these, declared plainly that he sought the better country, that is, the heavenly. Job was taught of God to believe in a living Redeemer; to look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come; he comforted himself with the expectation of these. Job was assured, that this Redeemer of sinners from the yoke of Satan and the condemnation of sin, was his Redeemer, and expected salvation through him; and that he was a living Redeemer, though not yet come in the flesh; and that at the last day he would appear as the Judge of the world, to raise the dead, and complete the redemption of his people. With what pleasure holy Job enlarges upon this! May these faithful sayings be engraved by the Holy Spirit upon our hearts. We are all concerned to see that the root of the matter be in us. A living, quickening, commanding principle of grace in the heart, is the root of the matter; as necessary to our religion as the root of the tree, to which it owes both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Job and his friends differed concerning the methods of Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter, the belief of another world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whom I shall see for myself - It will not come to be by mere report. I shall not merely hear of the decision of God in my favor, but I shall myself behold him. He will at length come forth, and I shall be permitted to see him, and shall have the delightful assurance that he settles this controversy in my favor, and declares that I am his friend. Job was thus permitted to see God <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>, and hear his voice in his favor. He spake to him from the whirlwind <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>, and pronounced the sentence in his favor which he had desired.<p>And not another - Margin, a stranger. So in the Hebrew. The meaning is, that his own eyes would be permitted to see him. He would have the satisfaction of seeing God himself, and of hearing the sentence in his favor. That expectation he deemed worthy of a permanent record, and wished it transmitted to future times, that in his darkest days and severest trials - when God overwhelmed him, and man forsook him, he still firmly maintained his confidence in God, and his belief that he would come forth to vindicate his cause.<p>Though my reins - The margin renders this, "my reins within me are consumed with earnest desire for that day." Noyes translates it, "For this my soul panteth within me." Herder,<p>I shall see him as my deliverer,<p>Mine eyes shall behold him, as mine,<p>For whom my heart so long fainted.<p>So Wemyss, "My reins faint with desire of his arrival." Jerome renders it (Vulgate), reposita est hoec spes mea in sinu meo - "this, my hope, is laid up in my bosom." The Septuagint, "All which things have been done - &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  suntetelestai - in my bosom," but what they understood by this it is difficult to say. The word rendered "reins" &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;  k&#305;&#770;lya&#770;h - or in the plural &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;  k&#305;&#770;lyo&#770;th - in which form only it is found), means properly the reins, or the kidneys <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>. and then comes to denote the inward parts, and then the seat of the desires and affections, because in strong emotions the inward parts are affected. We speak of the heart as the seat of the affections, but with no more propriety than the Hebrews did of the upper viscera in general, or of the reins. In the Scriptures the heart and the reins are united as the seat of the affections. Thus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>, God "trieth the reins and the heart;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>. I see no reason why the word here may not be used to denote the viscera in general, and that the idea may be, that he felt that his disease was invading the seat of life, and his body, in all its parts, was wasting away. Our word vitals, perhaps, expresses the idea.<p>Be consumed - Gesenius renders this, "Pine away." So Noyes, Wemyss, and some others. But the proper meaning of the word is, to consume, to be wasted, to be destroyed. The word &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;  ka&#770;la&#770;h strictly means to finish, complete, render entire; and thence has the notion of completion or finishing - whether by making a thing perfect, or by destroying it. It is used with reference to the eyes that fail or waste away with weeping, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>, or to the spirit or heart. as fainting with grief and sorrow. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-7.htm">Psalm 143:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>. It is used often in the sense of destroying. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-13.htm">Ezra 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-10.htm">Isaiah 27:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-4.htm">Isaiah 49:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-30.htm">Genesis 41:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>; et soepe al. This, I think, is the meaning here. Job affirms that his whole frame, external and internal, was wasting away, yet he had confidence that he would see God.<p>Within me - Margin, in my bosom. So the Hebrew. The word bosom is used here as we use the word chest - and is not improperly rendered "within me." In view of this exposition of the words, I would translate the whole passage as follows:<p>For I know that my Avenger liveth,<p>And that hereafter he shall stand upon the earth;<p>And though after my skin this (flesh) shall be destroyed,<p>Yet even without my flesh shall I see God:<p>Whom I shall see for myself,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. for myself&#8212;for my advantage, as my friend.<p>not another&#8212;Mine eyes shall behold Him, but no longer as one estranged from me, as now [Bengel].<p>though&#8212;better omitted.<p>my reins&#8212;inward recesses of the heart.<p>be consumed within me&#8212;that is, pine with longing desire for that day (Ps 84:2; 119:81).

The position of the words, however, close beside the phrase “mine eyes,” is rather in favour of the other view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">though my reins be consumed</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">my reins consume within me</span>, lit. <span class="ital">in my bosom</span> (marg.).

The reins are the seat of the deepest feelings and experiences, especially of those toward God. Job began with expressing his assurance that he should see God, but as he proceeds so vivid is his hope that it becomes almost reality, the intensity of his thought creates an ecstatic condition of mind in which the vision of God seems almost realized, and he faints in the presence of it.

His natural strength becomes more and more feeble, and his voice weaker and weaker. It is a feeling of sadness that prevails in the preceding description of suffering, and now even stamps the address to the friends with a tone of importunate entreaty which shall, if possible, affect their heart. They are indeed his friends, as the emphatic &#1512;&#1506;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; affirms; impelled towards him by sympathy they are come, and at least stand by him while all other men flee from him. They are therefore to grant him favour (&#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, prop. to incline to) in the place of right; it is enough that the hand of Eloah has touched him (in connection with this, one is reminded that leprosy is called &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;, and is pre-eminently accounted as plaga divina; wherefore the suffering Messiah also bears the significant name &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1491;&#1489;&#1497; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, "the leprous one from the school of Rabbi," in the Talmud, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>), they are not to make the divine decree heavier to him by their uncharitableness. Wherefore do ye persecute me - he asks them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a> - like as God (&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, according to Saad. and Ralbag  equals  &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which would be very tame); by which he means not merely that they add their persecution to God's, but that they take upon themselves God's work, that they usurp to themselves a judicial divine authority, they act towards him as if they were superhuman (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>), and therefore inhumanly, since they, who are but his equals, look down upon him from an assumed and false elevation. The other half of the question: wherefore are ye not full of my flesh (de ma chair, with &#1502;&#1503;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a>), but still continue to devour it? is founded upon a common Semitic figurative expression, with which may be compared our Germ. expression, "to gnaw with the tooth of slander" comp. Engl. "backbiting". In Chaldee, &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1511;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; &#1491;&#1497;, to eat the pieces of (any one), is equivalent to, to slander him; in Syriac, ochelqarsso is the name of Satan, like &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The Arabic here, as almost everywhere in the book of Job, presents a still closer parallel; for Arab.
