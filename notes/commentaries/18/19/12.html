What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His troops - The calamities which he had sent, and which are here represented as "armies" or "soldiers" to accomplish his work.

Afflictions which are many, and of which it may be said, as was at the birth of God, who had his name from the word here used, "a troop cometh": <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-11.htm">Genesis 30:11</a>; and these sometimes come together, or follow so quick one upon another, that there is scarce any interval between them, as did Job's afflictions; and they are God's hosts, his troops, his soldiers, which are at his command; and he says to them, as the centurion did to his, to the one, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and it comes: <p>and raise up their way against me; as an army, when it comes against a place, throws up a bank to raise their artillery upon, that they may play it to greater advantage; or make a broad causeway, for the soldiers to march abreast against it; or an high cast up way, as the word (y) signifies, over a ditch or dirty place in a hollow, that they may the better pass over: some read it, "they raise up their way upon me" (z); he opposing and standing in the way was crushed down by them, and trampled upon, and over whom they passed as on an highway, and in a beaten path; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>; but most render it, "against me"; for Job looked upon all his afflictions, as Jacob did <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-36.htm">Genesis 42:36</a>, to be against him, to militate against him, and threaten him with ruin, when they were all working for him, even for his good: <p>and encamp round about my tabernacle: as an army round about a city when besieging it. Job may have respect to the tabernacle of his body, as that is sometimes so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>; and to the diseases of it; which being a complication, might be said to encamp about him, or surround him on all sides. <p>(y) "aggerant", Cocceius, Schultens; "straverunt", Montanus, Schmidt; a "via strata et elevata", Mercerus, Drusius.
