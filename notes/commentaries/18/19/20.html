What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh - The meaning of this probably is, "my skin and flesh are dried up so that the bone seems adhere to the skin, and so tht the form of the bone becomes visible." It is designed to denote a state of great emaciation, and describes an effect which we often see.<p>And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth - A very difficult expression, and which has greatly perplexed commentators, and on whose meaning they are by no means agreed. Dr. Good renders it, "and in the skin of my teeth am I dissolved;" but what that means is as difficult of explanation as the original. Noyes, "and I have scarcely escaped with the skin of my teeth." Herde, (as translated by Marsh,) "and scarcely the skin in my teeth have I brought away as a spoil." He says that "the figure is taken from the prey which wild beasts carry in their teeth; his skin is his poor and wretched body, which alone he had escaped with. His friends are represented as carnivorous animals which gnaw upon his skin, upon the poor remnant of life;" but the Hebrew will not bear this construction. Poole observes, quaintly enough, that it means, "I am scarcely sound and whole and free from sores in any part of my skin, except that of my jaws, which holdeth and covereth the roots of my teeth. This being, as divers observe, the devil's policy, to leave his mouth untouched, that be might more freely express his mind, and vent his blasphemies against God, which he supposed sharp pain would force him to do." Schultens has mentioned four different interpretations given to the phrase, none of which seems to be perfectly satisfactory. They are the following:<p>(1) That it means that the skin "about" the teeth alone was preserved, or the gums and the lips, so that he had the power of speaking, though every other part was wasted away, and this exposition is given, accompanied with the suggestion that his faculty of speech was preserved entire by Satan, in order that he might be "able" to utter the language of complaint and blasphemy against God.<p>(2) That he was emaciated and exhausted completely, "except" the skin about his teeth, that is, his lips, and that by them he was kept alive; that if it were not for them he could not breathe, but must soon expire.<p>(3) That the teeth themselves had fallen out by the force of disease, and that nothing was left but the gums. This opinion Schultens himself adopts. The image, be says, is taken from pugilists, whose teeth are knocked out by each other; and the meaning he supposes to be, that Job had been treated by his disease in the same manner. So violent had it been that he had lost all his teeth and nothing was left but his gums.<p>(4) A fourth opinion is, that the reference is to the "enamel" of the teeth, and that the meaning is, that such was the force and extent of his afflictions that all his teeth became hollow and were decayed, leaving only the enamel. It is difficult to determine the true sense amidst a multitude of learned conjectures; but probably the most simple and easy interpretation is the best. It may mean that he was "almost" consumed. Disease had preyed upon his frame until he was wasted away. Nothing was left but his lips, or his gums; he was just able to speak, and that was all. So Jerome renders it, delicta sunt tantummodo labia circa dentes meos. Luther renders it, und kann meine Zahne mit der Haut nicht bedecken - "and I cannot cover my teeth with the skin;" that is, with the lips. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. Extreme meagerness. The bone seemed to stick in the skin, being seen through it, owing to the flesh drying up and falling away from the bone. The Margin, "as to my flesh," makes this sense clearer. The English Version, however, expresses the same: "And to my flesh," namely, which has fallen away from the bone, instead of firmly covering it.<p>skin of my teeth&#8212;proverbial. I have escaped with bare life; I am whole only with the skin of my teeth; that is, my gums alone are whole, the rest of the skin of my body is broken with sores (Job 7:5; Ps 102:5).

Or, "as to my flesh" (o), as Mr. Broughton and others render the words; as his bones used to stick to his flesh, and were covered with it, now his flesh being consumed and wasted away with his disease, they stuck to his skin, and were seen through it; he was reduced to skin and bone, and was a mere skeleton, what with the force of his bodily disorder, and the grief of his mind through the treatment he met with from God and men, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>; <p>and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth; meaning not, as some understand it, his lips, which covered his teeth; for those cannot be properly called the skin of them; rather the fine polish of the teeth, which fortifies them against the hurt and damage they would receive by what is ate and drank; though it seems best to interpret it of the skin of the gums, in which the teeth are set; and the sense is, that Job had escaped with his life, but not with a whole skin, his skin was broken all over him, with the sores and ulcers upon him, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-5.htm">Job 7:5</a>; only the skin of his teeth was preserved, and so Mr. Broughton renders it, "I am whole only in the skin of my teeth"; everywhere else his skin was broken; so the Targum, <p>"I am left in the skin of my teeth.'' <p>Some have thought that Satan, when he smote Job from head to feet with ulcers, spared his mouth, lips, and teeth, the instruments of speech, that he might therewith curse God, which was the thing he aimed at, and proposed to bring him to, by getting a grant from God to afflict him in the manner he did. <p>(o)  "cuti meae ut carni meae", Tremellius, in one edition of his version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My bone <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</span><p>(k) Besides these great losses and most cruel unkindness, he was touched in his own person as follows.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. The desertion and loathing of mankind is universal, and to this is added his exhausted state from disease.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">My bone cleaveth to my skin</span>] The words describe his emaciated condition, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm" title="Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin sticks to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.">Lamentations 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-5.htm" title="By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones stick to my skin.">Psalm 102:5</a>, My bones cleave to my skin (marg. flesh); <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm" title="I may tell all my bones: they look and stare on me.">Psalm 22:17</a>, I may tell (count) all my bones.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">escaped with the skin of my teeth</span>] i. e. with nothing else. The “skin of my teeth” is usually held to mean the gums, which Job represents as still sound, otherwise he would be unable to speak; the last stage of his disease has not yet been reached. In <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm" title="My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children's sake of my own body.">Job 19:17</a></span> however he referred to his fetid breath, and in such distempers the mouth and throat are usually rapidly affected. Besides, such a sense is prosaic and flat. The phrase is probably proverbial; the meaning of Job being that he is wholly fallen a prey to his disease, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-12.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; As the shepherd takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.">Amos 3:12</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh</span>. Here the third source of Job's misery is brought forward - his painful and incurable disease. This has brought him to such a pitch of emaciation that his bones seem to adhere to the tightened skin, and the scanty and shrunken muscles, that cover them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>). Such emaciation of the general frame is quite compatible with the unsightly swelling of certain parts of the body which characterizes elephantiasis<span class="cmt_word">. And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth</span>. The expression is, no doubt, proverbial, and signifies "barely escaped;" but its origin is obscure. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  His troops came together,<p>And threw up their way against me,<p>And encamped round about my tent.<p>13  My brethren hath He removed far from me,<p>And my acquaintance are quite estranged from me.<p>14  My kinsfolk fail,<p>And those that knew me have forgotten me.<p>15  The slaves of my house and my maidens,<p>They regard me as a stranger,<p>I am become a perfect stranger in their eyes.<p>It may seem strange that we do not connect <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-12.htm">Job 19:12</a> with the preceding strophe or group of verses; but between <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-21.htm">Job 19:21</a> there are thirty &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, which, in connection with the arrangement of the rest of this speech in decastichs (accidentally coinciding remarkably with the prominence given to the number ten in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a>), seem intended to be divided into three decastichs, and can be so divided without doing violence to the connection. While in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-12.htm">Job 19:12</a>, in connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11</a>, Job describes the course of the wrath, which he has to withstand as if he were an enemy of God, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13</a>. he refers back to the degradation complained of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-9.htm">Job 19:9</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-12.htm">Job 19:12</a> he compares himself to a besieged (perhaps on account of revolt) city. God's &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (not: bands of marauders, as Dietr. interprets, but: troops, i.e., of regular soldiers, synon. of &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-17.htm">Job 10:17</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-3.htm">Job 25:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29-25.htm">Job 29:25</a>, from the root &#1490;&#1491;, to unite, join, therefore prop. the assembled, a heap; vid., Frst's Handwrterbuch) are the bands of outwards and inward sufferings sent forth against him for a combined attack (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;). Heaping up a way, i.e., by filling up the ramparts, is for the purpose of making the attack upon the city with battering-rams (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-14.htm">Job 16:14</a>) and javelins, and then the storm, more effective (on this erection of offensive ramparts (approches), called elsewhere &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; &#1505;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492;, vid., Keil's Archologie, 159). One result of this condition of siege in which God's wrath has placed him is that he is avoided and despised as one smitten of God: neither love and fidelity, nor obedience and dependence, meet him from any quarter. What he has said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>, that he is become a byword and an abomination (an object to spit upon), he here describes in detail. There is no ground for understanding &#1488;&#1495;&#1497; in the wider sense of relations; brethren is meant here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>. He calls his relations &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-12.htm">Psalm 38:12</a>. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; are (in accordance with the pregnant biblical use of this word in the sense of nosse cum affectu et effectu) those who know him intimately (with objective suff. as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>), and &#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>, and freq., those intimately known to him; both, therefore, so-called heart-or bosom-friends. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; Jer. well translates inquilinin domus meae; they are, in distinction from those who by birth belong to the nearer and wider circle of the family, persons who are received into this circle as servants, as vassals (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>, and Arabic ja&#770;r, an associate, one sojourning in a strange country under the protection of its government, a neighbour), here espec. the domestics. The verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (Ges. 60) is construed with the nearest feminine subject. These people, who ought to thank him for taking them into his house, regard him as one who does not belong to it (&#1494;&#1512;); he is looked upon by them as a perfect stranger (&#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;), as an intruder from another country. </body></html>
