What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why do ye persecute me as God? - As God has done. That is, without giving me any reason for it; accusing me of crimes without proof, and condeming me without mitigation. That there is here an improper reflection on God, will be apparent to all. It accords with what Job frequently expresses where he speaks of him as judging him severly, and is on of the instances which prove that he was not entirely perfect.<p>And are not satisfied with my flesh - That is, are not contented that my "body" is subjected to inexpressible torment, and is wholly wasting away, but add to this the torment of the soul. Why is it not enough that my "body" is thus tormented without adding the severer tortures of the mind? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. as God&#8212;has persecuted me.

As if they were in his stead, or had the same power and authority over him, who is a sovereign Being, and does what he pleases with his creatures, and is not accountable to any for what he does; but this is not the case of men, nor are they to imitate God in all things; what he does is not in all things a warrant to do the like, or to be pleaded and followed as a precedent by them; they should be merciful as he is merciful, but they are not to afflict and distress his people because he does, and which he does for wise ends and reasons; for such a conduct is resented by him, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>. God persecuted or pursued and followed Job with one affliction after another, and hunted him as a fierce lion does his prey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-16.htm">Job 10:16</a>; but this was not a reason why they should do the same. Some read the words, "why do ye persecute me as those?" (p) you that profess to be my friends, why do ye persecute me as those before mentioned, as those wicked men? or "with those", with such reproaches and calumnies; but the original will not bear it: <p>and are not satisfied with my flesh? It was not enough that he was afflicted in his body, and his flesh was ulcerated from head to feet, and was clothed with worms and clods of dust; they were not content that his children, which were his own flesh, were tore away from him, and destroyed; and that his substance, which is sometimes called the flesh of men, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>; was devoured, and he was spoiled and plundered of it; but they sought to afflict his mind, to wound his spirit, by their heavy charges and accusations, by their calumnies and reproaches, and hard censures of him; he suggests, that they dealt with him more cruelly than savage beasts, who, when they have got their prey, are satisfied with their flesh; but they, who would be thought to be his friends, were not satisfied with his. <p>(p) Ben Gersom. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Why do ye persecute me as <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> God, and are not satisfied with my <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> flesh?</span><p>(n) Is it not enough that God punishes me, unless you by reproaching increase my sorrow?<p>(o) To see my body punished, unless you trouble my mind?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">satisfied with my flesh</span>] Why cannot ye be sated with devouring me?

If he, his master, now in such need of assistance, desires any service from him, he is obliged (fut. with the sense of being compelled, as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-2.htm">Job 17:2</a>) to entreat him with his mouth. &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503;, to beg &#1495;&#1503; of any one for one's self (vid., supra, p. 365), therefore to implore, supplicare; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; here (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-30.htm">Psalm 109:30</a>) as a more significant expression of that which is loud and intentional (not as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-5.htm">Job 16:5</a>, in contrast to that which proceeds from the heart). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>, &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; signifies neither my vexation (Hirz.) nor my spirit  equals  I((Umbr., Hahn, with the Syr.), for &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; in the sense of angry humour (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-13.htm">Job 15:13</a>) does not properly suit the predicate, and Arab. ru&#770;h&#803;y in the signification ipse may certainly be used in Arabic, where ru&#770;h&#803; (perhaps under the influence of the philosophical usage of the language) signifies the animal spirit-life (Psychol. S. 154), not however in Hebrew, where &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is the stereotype form in that sense. If one considers that the elephantiasis, although its proper pathological symptom consists in an enormous hypertrophy of the cellular tissue of single distinct portions of the body, still easily, if the bronchia are drawn into sympathy, or if (what is still more natural) putrefaction of the blood with a scorbutic ulcerous formation in the mouth comes on, has difficulty of breathing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>) and stinking breath as its result, as also a stinking exhalation and the discharge of a stinking fluid from the decaying limbs is connected with it (vid., the testimony of the Arabian physicians in Stickel, S. 169f.), it cannot be doubted that Jer. has lighted upon the correct thing when he transl. halitum meum exhorruit uxor mea. &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497; is intended as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-1.htm">Job 17:1</a>, and it is unnecessary to derive &#1494;&#1512;&#1492; from a special verb &#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, although in Arab. the notions which are united in the Hebr. &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; .r, deflectere and abhorrere (to turn one's self away from what is disgusting or horrible), are divided between Arab. za&#770;r med.

Je (vid., Frst's Handwrterbuch).<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a> the meaning of &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is specially questionable. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-10.htm">Psalm 77:10</a>, &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>, an infinitive from &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, formed after the manner of the Lamed He verbs.

As regards the accentuation, according to which &#1493;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is accented by Rebia mugrasch on the ultima, this does not necessarily decide in favour of its being infin., since in the 1 praet. &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, which, according to rule, has the tone on the penultima, the ultima is also sometimes (apart from the perf. consec.) found accented (on this, vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>, and Ew. 197, a), as &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;, also admit of both accentuations.<p>continued...</body></html>
