So Houbigant understands him, interpreting these words in connection with the preceding, thus: <span class="ital">But if ye shall say, Let us persecute him, and devise some cause of accusation against him: then be afraid for yourselves from the threatening sword. </span>Job may be considered, however, as threatening them with punishment on account of their past uncharitable and unrighteous judgment of him, and severe treatment of him. <span class="ital">For wrath bringeth the punishment of the sword — </span>That <span class="ital">wrath, </span>or <span class="ital">fury, </span>which is in your hearts, and breaks forth from your lips against me, deserves and will certainly bring upon you <span class="ital">the punishment of the sword, </span>that is, a dreadful judgment from God.

Here he witnessed a good confession; declared the soundness of his faith, and the assurance of his hope. Here is much of Christ and heaven; and he that said such things are these, declared plainly that he sought the better country, that is, the heavenly. Job was taught of God to believe in a living Redeemer; to look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come; he comforted himself with the expectation of these. Job was assured, that this Redeemer of sinners from the yoke of Satan and the condemnation of sin, was his Redeemer, and expected salvation through him; and that he was a living Redeemer, though not yet come in the flesh; and that at the last day he would appear as the Judge of the world, to raise the dead, and complete the redemption of his people. With what pleasure holy Job enlarges upon this! May these faithful sayings be engraved by the Holy Spirit upon our hearts. We are all concerned to see that the root of the matter be in us. A living, quickening, commanding principle of grace in the heart, is the root of the matter; as necessary to our religion as the root of the tree, to which it owes both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Job and his friends differed concerning the methods of Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter, the belief of another world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be ye afraid of the sword - Of the sword of justice, of the wrath of God. In taking such views, and using such language, you ought to dread the vengeance of God, for he will punish the guilty.<p>For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword - The word "bringeth" is supplied by the translators, and as it seems to me improperly. The idea is, that wrath or anger such as they had manifested, was proper for punishment; that such malice as they had shown was a crime that God would not suffer to escape unpunished. They had, therefore, everything to dread. Literally, it is, "for wrath the iniquities of the sword;" that is, wrath is a crime for the sword.<p>That ye may know that there is a judgment - That there is justice; that God punishes injuries done to the character, and that he will come forth to vindicate his friends. Probably Job anticipated that when God should come forth to vindicate "him," he would inflict exemplary punishment on "them;" and that this would be not only by words, but by some heavy judgment, such as he had himself experienced. The vindication of the just is commonly attended with the punishment of the unjust; the salvation of the friends of God is connected with the destruction of his foes. Job seems to have anticipated this in the case of himself and his friends; it will certainly occur in the great day when the affairs of this world shall be wound up in the decisions of the final judgment.

The "wrath" of God at His appearing for the temporal vindication of Job against the friends (Job 42:7) is a pledge of the eternal wrath at the final coming to glorify the saints and judge their enemies (2Th 1:6-10; Isa 25:8).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of the sword, </span> i.e. of some considerable judgment to be inflicted on you, which is called the sword; as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm" title="If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.">Deu 32:41</a></span>, and oft elsewhere.

Not of the civil magistrate, nor of a foreign enemy, but of the avenging sword of divine justice; lest God should whet the glittering sword of his justice, and his hand should take hold of judgment, in order to avenge the wrongs of the innocent; unless the other should also be considered as his instruments: <p>for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, or "sins of the sword" (l): the sense is, either that the wrath of men, in persecuting the people of God, puts them upon the commission of such sins as deserve to be punished with the sword, either of the civil magistrate, or of a foreign enemy, or of divine justice; or else the wrath of God brings on more punishments for their sins by means of the sword; and to this sense is the Targum, <p>"when God is angry for iniquities, he sends those that slay with the sword:'' <p>that ye may know there is a judgment; that is executed in the world by the Judge of all the earth, who will do right; and that there is a future judgment after death, unto which everything in this world will be brought, when God will judge the world in righteousness by Christ, whom he has ordained to be Judge of quick and dead; and which will be a righteous judgment, that none can escape; and when, Job suggests, the controversy between him and his friends would be determined; and it would be then seen who was in the right, and who in the wrong; and unto which time he seems willing to refer his cause, and to have no more said about it; but his friends did not choose to take his advice; for Zophar the Naamathite starts up directly; and makes a reply, which is contained in the following chapter. <p>(l)  "iniquitates gladii", Montanus, Schmidt, Michaelis; so Cocceius, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath <i>bringeth</i> the <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> punishments of the sword, that ye may know <i>there is</i> a judgment.</span><p>(t) God will be avenged of this harsh judgment by which you condemned me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword</span>] This translation seems to assume that “wrath” here is that of men, such wrath as Job’s friends shewed towards him. But the word is too strong to be taken in this sense. The Divine “wrath” or fury is meant. The phrase “punishments of the sword” means most naturally, the punishments inflicted by the sword. The whole expression would thus mean, <span class="ital">for wrath</span> (i. e. in wrath, or, wrathful) <span class="ital">are the punishments of the sword</span>—the “sword” being as before God’s judicial sword. Others render, “<span class="ital">transgressions</span> of the sword,” i. e. such transgressions as bring down the Divine sword; but the phrase “transgressions of the sword are wrath,” i. e. have to bear wrath as their reward or chastisement, (Delitzsch) is exceedingly cumbrous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that … there is a judgment</span>] The reference is not to any final or general judgment, but to the fact that God does in truth judge and punish injustice, such as the friends were guilty of; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-10.htm" title="He will surely reprove you, if you do secretly accept persons.">Job 13:10</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>. The translation assumes a form of the relative conjunction <span class="ital">that</span> which nowhere else occurs in the Book of Job, and there may be some fault in the text.

His natural strength becomes more and more feeble, and his voice weaker and weaker. It is a feeling of sadness that prevails in the preceding description of suffering, and now even stamps the address to the friends with a tone of importunate entreaty which shall, if possible, affect their heart. They are indeed his friends, as the emphatic &#1512;&#1506;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; affirms; impelled towards him by sympathy they are come, and at least stand by him while all other men flee from him. They are therefore to grant him favour (&#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, prop. to incline to) in the place of right; it is enough that the hand of Eloah has touched him (in connection with this, one is reminded that leprosy is called &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;, and is pre-eminently accounted as plaga divina; wherefore the suffering Messiah also bears the significant name &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1491;&#1489;&#1497; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, "the leprous one from the school of Rabbi," in the Talmud, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>), they are not to make the divine decree heavier to him by their uncharitableness. Wherefore do ye persecute me - he asks them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a> - like as God (&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, according to Saad. and Ralbag  equals  &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which would be very tame); by which he means not merely that they add their persecution to God's, but that they take upon themselves God's work, that they usurp to themselves a judicial divine authority, they act towards him as if they were superhuman (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>), and therefore inhumanly, since they, who are but his equals, look down upon him from an assumed and false elevation. The other half of the question: wherefore are ye not full of my flesh (de ma chair, with &#1502;&#1503;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a>), but still continue to devour it? is founded upon a common Semitic figurative expression, with which may be compared our Germ. expression, "to gnaw with the tooth of slander" comp. Engl. "backbiting". In Chaldee, &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1511;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; &#1491;&#1497;, to eat the pieces of (any one), is equivalent to, to slander him; in Syriac, ochelqarsso is the name of Satan, like &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The Arabic here, as almost everywhere in the book of Job, presents a still closer parallel; for Arab. 'kl lh&#803;m signifies to eat any one's flesh, then (different from &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>) equivalent to, to slander, <p>(Note: Vid., Schultens' ad Prov. Meidanii, p. 7 (where "to eat his own flesh," equivalent to "himself," without allowing others to do it, signifies to censure his kinsmen), and comp. the phrase Arab. aclu-l-a&#8219;ra&#770;dhi in the signification arrodere existimationem hominum in Makkari, i. 541, 13.)<p>since an evil report is conceived of as a wild beast, which delights in tearing a neighbour to pieces, as the friends do not refrain from doing, since, from the love of their assumption that his suffering must be the retributive punishment of heinous sins, they lay sins to his charge of which he is not conscious, and which he never committed. Against these uncharitable and groundless accusations he wishes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-23.htm">Job 19:23</a>) that the testimony of his innocence, to which they will not listen, might be recorded in a book for posterity, or because a book may easily perish, graven in a rock (therefore not on leaden plates) with an iron style, and the addition of lead, with which to fill up the engraved letters, and render them still more imperishable.
