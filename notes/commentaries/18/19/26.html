Here he witnessed a good confession; declared the soundness of his faith, and the assurance of his hope. Here is much of Christ and heaven; and he that said such things are these, declared plainly that he sought the better country, that is, the heavenly. Job was taught of God to believe in a living Redeemer; to look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come; he comforted himself with the expectation of these. Job was assured, that this Redeemer of sinners from the yoke of Satan and the condemnation of sin, was his Redeemer, and expected salvation through him; and that he was a living Redeemer, though not yet come in the flesh; and that at the last day he would appear as the Judge of the world, to raise the dead, and complete the redemption of his people. With what pleasure holy Job enlarges upon this! May these faithful sayings be engraved by the Holy Spirit upon our hearts. We are all concerned to see that the root of the matter be in us. A living, quickening, commanding principle of grace in the heart, is the root of the matter; as necessary to our religion as the root of the tree, to which it owes both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Job and his friends differed concerning the methods of Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter, the belief of another world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And though - Margin, Or, after I shall awake, though this body be destroyed, yet out of my flesh shall I see God. This verse has given not less perplexity than the preceding. Noyes renders it,<p>And though with this skin this body be wasted away,<p>Yet in my flesh shall I see God.<p>Dr. Good renders it,<p>And, after the disease hath destroyed my skin,<p>That in my flesh I shall see God.<p>Rosenmuller explains it, "And when after my skin (scil. is consumed and destroyed) they consume (scil. those corroding, or consuming, that is, it is corroded, or broken into fragments) this, that is, this structure of my bones - my body (which he does not mention, because it was so wasted away that it did not deserve to be called a body) - yet without my flesh - with my whole body consumed, shall I see God." He translates it,<p>Et quum post cutem meam hoc fuerit consumptum,<p>Tamen absque carne mea videbo Deum.<p>The Hebrew is literally, "and after my skin." Gesenius translates it, "After they shall have destroyed my skin, this shall happen - that I will see God." Herder renders it,<p>Though they tear and devour this my skin,<p>Yet in my living body shall I see God.<p>The fair and obvious meaning, I think, is that which is conveyed by our translation. Disease had attacked his skin. It was covered with ulcers, and was fast consuming; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-5.htm">Job 7:5</a>. This process of corruption and decay he had reason to expect would go on until all would be consumed. But if it did, he would hold fast his confidence in God. He would believe that he would come forth as his vindicator, and he would still put his trust in him.<p>Worms - This word is supplied by our translators. There is not a semblance of it in the original. That is, simply, "they destroy;" where the verb is used impersonally, meaning that it would be destroyed; The agent by which this would be done is not specified. The word rendered "destroy" &#1504;&#1511;&#1508;&#1493;  na&#770;qaphu&#770; from &#1504;&#1511;&#1507;  na&#770;qaph, means "to cut, to strike, to cut down" (compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>, for the general meaning of the word), and here means to destroy; that is, that the work of destruction might go on until the frame should be wholly wasted away. It is not quite certain that the word here would convey the idea that he expected to die. It may mean that he would become entirely emaciated, and all his flesh be gone. There is nothing, however, in the word to show that he did not expect to die - and perhaps that would be the most obvious and proper interpretation.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. Rather, though after my skin (is no more) this (body) is destroyed ("body" being omitted, because it was so wasted as not to deserve the name), yet from my flesh (from my renewed body, as the starting-point of vision, So 2:9, "looking out from the windows") "shall I see God." Next clause [Job 19:27] proves bodily vision is meant, for it specifies "mine eyes" [Rosenmuller, 2d ed.]. The Hebrew opposes "in my flesh."

The word <span class="ital">destroy</span> means <span class="ital">to break off</span>, strike down or off, as branches from a tree (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm" title="And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.">Isaiah 10:34</a>). The words literally run, <span class="ital">and after my skin which they have destroyed</span> even <span class="ital">this</span> (probably pointing to himself). The indeterminate construction <span class="ital">which they have destroyed</span> is equivalent to our passive, <span class="ital">which has been destroyed</span>. The Heb. construction must be given somewhat freely in English, as above. The words “worms” and “body” have nothing corresponding in the original.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yet in my flesh</span>] Better, as above, <span class="bld">and without my flesh</span>. The margin, <span class="ital">out of</span> (or, <span class="ital">from</span>) <span class="ital">my flesh</span>, suggests the explanation how such opposite senses may be arrived at. The Heb. prep. <span class="ital">from</span> has the same ambiguity as <span class="ital">from</span> in English. When Regan in <span class="ital">Lear</span> 11. 1 says,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of differences, which I best thought it fit<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To answer from our home,”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>her words most naturally perhaps suggest the meaning that she thought it best to answer <span class="ital">at</span> home, her home being the place from which the answer was sent. Her meaning, however, is that she thought it best to answer when she was <span class="ital">away from</span> home. Similarly when Job says, from (or, out of) my flesh shall I see God, the meaning may be, that (looking) from his flesh he shall see God, i. e. as A. V. <span class="ital">in</span> his flesh; or that he shall see God, (when) away from his flesh, i. e. <span class="ital">without</span> his flesh. The context and general scope of the passage decides for the latter sense. For a similar use of the Heb. prep. see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-15.htm" title="For then shall you lift up your face without spot; yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:">Job 11:15</a>, <span class="ital">away from</span> (=without) <span class="ital">spot</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm" title="Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God on them.">Job 21:9</a>, margin; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-4.htm" title="The flood breaks out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.">Job 28:4</a>, they hang (far) <span class="ital">away from men</span>, they swing; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-39.htm" title="And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;">Genesis 27:39</a>, away from (without) the fatness; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-24.htm" title="Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet smell to the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.">Numbers 15:24</a>, marg. The whole expression “after this my skin has been destroyed and without my flesh” means “when I have died under the ravages of my disease.” The words do not express <span class="ital">in</span> what condition precisely, but <span class="ital">after</span> what events Job shall see God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall I see God</span>] The connexion is, But I know that my Redeemer liveth, and he who shall be after me shall stand upon the dust, and … I shall see God. The last words explain who Job’s Redeemer or Goel is, and who He is who remaineth or shall come after him, viz. God. After his skin is destroyed and without his flesh he shall see God. Before death he shall not see Him, for he shall die under His afflicting hand (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-14.htm" title="For he performes the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.">Job 23:14</a>), but he shall yet behold Him. To <span class="ital">see</span> God is to see Him reconciled and in peace, for this is implied in seeing Him at all, because now He hides.

This may be taken merely as a prophecy of the theophany recorded in ch. 38-42. (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>). But the nexus with ver. 25, and the expressions there used - "at the last," and "he shall stand up over my dust" - fully justify the traditional exegesis, which sees in the passage an avowal by Job of his confidence that he will see God "from his body" at the resurrection. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; is the name he gives those to whom he confides his most secret affairs; &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>) signifies either with a verbal notion, secret speaking (Arab. sa&#770;wada, III. form from sa&#770;da, to press one's self close upon, esp. as sa&#770;rra, to speak in secret with any one), or what is made firm, i.e., what is impenetrable, therefore a secret (from sa&#770;da, to be or make close, firm, compact; cognate root, &#1497;&#1505;&#1491;, wasada, cognate in signification, sirr, a secret, from sarra, &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;, which likewise signifies to make firm). Those to whom he has made known his most secret plans (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13-15</a>) now abhor him; and those whom he has thus (&#1494;&#1492;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-17.htm">Job 15:17</a>) become attached to, and to whom he has shown his affection, - he says this with an allusion to the three, - have turned against him. They gave tokens of their love and honour to him, when he was in the height of his happiness and prosperity, but they have not even shown any sympathy with him in his present form of distress.<p>(Note: The disease which maims or devours the limbs, da&#770;'u el-gudha&#770;m [vid. supra, p. 281], which generically includes Arabian leprosy, cancer, and syphilis, and is called the "first-born of death" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-13.htm">Job 18:13</a>, is still in Arabia the most dreaded disease, in the face of which all human sympathy ceases. In the steppe, even the greatest personage who is seized with this disease is removed at least a mile or two from the encampment, where a charbu&#770;sh, i.e., a small black hair-tent, is put up for him, and an old woman, who has no relations living, is given him as an attendant until he dies. No one visits him, not even his nearest relations. He is cast off as muqa&#770;tal ollah. - Wetzst.

This is not contradictory to the primary characteristic symptom of the lepra nodosa; for the wasting away of the rest of the body may attain an extraordinarily high degree in connection with the hypertrophy of single parts. He can indeed say of himself, that he is only escaped (se soit chapp) with the skin of his teeth. By the "skin of his teeth" the gums are generally understood. But (1) the gum is not skin, and can therefore not be called "skin of the teeth" in any language; (2) Job complains in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a> of his offensive breath, which in itself does not admit of the idea of healthy gums, and especially if it be the result of a scorbutic ulceration of the mouth, presupposes an ulcerous destruction of the gums. The current translation, "with my gums," is therefore to be rejected on account both of the language and the matter. For this reason Stickel (whom Hahn follows) takes &#1506;&#1493;&#1512; as inf. from &#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, and translates: "I am escaped from it with my teeth naked" lit. with the being naked of my teeth, i.e., with teeth that are no longer covered, standing forward uncovered. This explanation is pathologically satisfactory; but it has against it (1) the translation of &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;, which is wide of the most natural interpretation of the word; (2) that in close connection with &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1502;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492; one expects the mention of a part of the body that has remained whole. Is there not, then, really a skin of the teeth in the proper sense? The gum is not skin, but the teeth are surrounded with a skin in the jaw, the so-called periosteum. If we suppose, what is natural enough, that his offensive breath, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>, arises from ulcers in the mouth (in connection with scorbutus, as is known, the breath has a terribly offensive smell), we obtain the following picture of Job's disease: his flesh is in part hypertrophically swollen, in part fearfully wasted away; the gums especially are destroyed and wasted away from the teeth, only the periosteum round about the teeth is still left to him, and single remnants of the covering of his loose and projecting teeth.<p>Thus we interpret &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; in the first signification of the words, and have also no need for supposing that <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a> is a proverbial phrase for "I have with great care and difficulty escaped the extreme." The declaration perfectly corresponds to the description of the disease; and it is altogether needless with Hupfeld, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-14.htm">Job 13:14</a>, to read &#1506;&#1493;&#1512; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, vitam solam et nudam vix reportavi, which is moreover inappropriate, since Job regards himself as one who is dying. Symm. alters the position of the &#1489;&#1468; similarly, since he translates after the Syriac Hexapla: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (&#1493;&#1514;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;) &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, from &#1502;&#1500;&#1496;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1496;, Arab. mllt&#803;, nudare pilis, which J. D. Michaelis also compares; the sense, however, which is thereby gained, is beneath all criticism. On the aoristic &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>. Stickel has on this passage an excursus on this ah, to which he also attributes, in this addition to the historic tense, the idea of striving after a goal: "I slip away, I escape;" it certainly gives vividness to the notion of the action, if it may not always have the force of direction towards anything. Therefore: with a destroyed flesh, and indeed so completely destroyed that there is even nothing left to him of sound skin except the skin of his teeth, wasted away to a skeleton, and become both to sight and smell a loathsome object; - such is the sufferer the friends have before them, - one who is tortured, besides, by a dark conflict which they only make more severe, - one who now implores them for pity, and because he has no pity to expect from man, presses forward to a hope which reaches beyond the grave. </body></html>
