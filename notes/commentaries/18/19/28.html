It seems preferable to render, “For ye say, What is a persecuted man to Him (why should He persecute any man without cause?), and therefore the root of the matter (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the cause of the afflictions) is, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>must be found in me.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm" title="But you should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?">Job 19:28</a></span>. <span class="ital">But ye should say — </span>Therefore, because this is my case, and my faith and hope are in God, it would become you, and it is your duty on this account, to say, <span class="ital">Why persecute we him? — </span>We are blameworthy that we have persecuted him with such bitter invectives, and we will do so no more; <span class="ital">seeing the root of the matter — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">דבר</span>, <span class="ital">dabar, of the word; is found in me — </span>That is, since my heart is sincere and upright before God, and the root, or foundation, of true religion <span class="ital">is in me. Cum veritas ipsa inveniatur in me, since the truth itself is found in me. — </span>Vatablus. The root of all true religion is living faith in that Redeemer of whom Job had just spoken, and in the <span class="ital">truth </span>and <span class="ital">grace </span>of God in and through him; faith working by love, overcoming the world, and purifying the heart; faith disarming death of its sting, and inspiring us with a lively, patient, joyful, and grateful hope of eternal life, such as Job had just expressed. This is <span class="ital">the root of the matter, </span>other things are but leaves in comparison of it. This, which implies the whole of godliness and righteousness, is the one thing needful. Let us see to it that this be found in us. And, with respect to others, let us believe that many have this root of the matter in them, who are not in every thing of our mind, and who have their follies, weaknesses, and mistakes: and let us be aware that it is at our peril if we persecute any such. Wo be to him that offends or causes to stumble and fall one of these little ones. God will resent and revenge it. Job and his friends differed in their views concerning the methods of Divine Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter; and, therefore, it was their duty not to have censured and persecuted, but to have lived in love with each other.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:23-29 The Spirit of God, at this time, seems to have powerfully wrought on the mind of Job. Here he witnessed a good confession; declared the soundness of his faith, and the assurance of his hope. Here is much of Christ and heaven; and he that said such things are these, declared plainly that he sought the better country, that is, the heavenly. Job was taught of God to believe in a living Redeemer; to look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come; he comforted himself with the expectation of these. Job was assured, that this Redeemer of sinners from the yoke of Satan and the condemnation of sin, was his Redeemer, and expected salvation through him; and that he was a living Redeemer, though not yet come in the flesh; and that at the last day he would appear as the Judge of the world, to raise the dead, and complete the redemption of his people. With what pleasure holy Job enlarges upon this! May these faithful sayings be engraved by the Holy Spirit upon our hearts. We are all concerned to see that the root of the matter be in us. A living, quickening, commanding principle of grace in the heart, is the root of the matter; as necessary to our religion as the root of the tree, to which it owes both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Job and his friends differed concerning the methods of Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter, the belief of another world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But ye should say - Noyes renders this, "Since ye say, 'How may we persecute him, and find grounds of accusation against him?'" Dr. Good,<p>Then shall ye say, "How did we persecute him?"<p>When the root of the matter is disclosed in me.<p>The Vulgate, "Why now do ye say, let us persecute him, and find ground of accusation - "radicem verbi" against him?" The Septuagint, "If you also say, What shall we say against him? and what ground of accusation - &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  rizan logou - shall we find in him?" Rosenmuller renders it, "When you say, let us persecute him, and see what ground of accusation we can find in him, then fear the sword." Most critics concur in such an interpretation as implies that they had sought a ground of accusation against him, and that they would have occasion to fear the divine displeasure on account of it. It seems to me, however, that our translators have given substantially the fair sense of the Hebrew. A slight variation would, perhaps, better express the idea: "For you will yet say, Why did we persecute him? The root of the matter was found in him - and since this will be the case, fear now that justice will overtake you for it, for vengeance will not always slumber when a friend of God is wronged."<p>Seeing the root of the matter - Margin, "and" what "root of matter is found in me." The word rendered "matter" (&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;  da&#770;ba&#770;r), "word or thing." means, properly, word or thing - and may refer to "any" thing. Here it is used in one of the two opposite senses, "piety" or "guilt" - as being "the thing" under consideration. The interpretation to be adopted must depend on the view taken of the other words of the sentence. To me it seems that it denotes piety, and that the idea is, that the root of true piety was in him, or that he was not a hypocrite. The word root is so common as to need no explanation. It is used sometimes to denote the "bottom," or the lowest part of anything - as e. g., the foot (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>, "margin"), the bottom of the mountains <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-9.htm">Job 28:9</a>, or of the sea, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-30.htm">Job 36:30</a>, "margin." Here it means the foundation, support, or source - as the root is of a tree; and the sense, I suppose, is, that he was not a dead trunk, but he was like a tree that had a root, and consequently support and life. Many critics, however, among whom is Gesenius, suppose that it means that the root of the controversy, that is, the ground of strife, was in "him," or that he was the cause of the whole dispute. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. Rather, "ye will then (when the Vindicator cometh) say, Why," &c.<p>root &#8230; in me&#8212;The root of pious integrity, which was the matter at issue, whether it could be in one so afflicted, is found in me.

I am no hypocrite, as you asperse me, but an upright person, having a root of true religion in me; which therefore should allay your censures, and make you willing to bear with some circumstantial defects or mistakes in my discourses, or miscarriages, into which my passion and pain might transport me, and make you repent of your cruel usage of a truly good man. But although Job had this root in his heart, yet this was doubted of, and not discernible by, Job’s friends, and therefore could be no argument to them. Possibly it might be better to understand by this <span class="ital">root of the word</span>, to wit, of God’s word, which is oft called <span class="ital">the word</span>, by way of eminency, the foundations or fundamental truths of Divine doctrine which Job held; as appeared by this glorious confession, howsoever he might err in the matter of controversy with them; which being a difference in lesser things, they should mildly have borne with it, and not aggravated it and traduced him, as if thereby he had renounced God, and the very principles of religion, as they did.

Your discourses and arguments have no truth nor solidity in them as mine have. You speak whatever cometh into your minds and mouths; but my discourses are rooted and grounded upon sound knowledge and deep consideration. But this was no convincing answer; for they could easily retort the same thing upon him again, and their affirmation might seem as good as his; for it was only a begging of the thing in question. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. A defence of themselves, and of their former sharp and severe discourses, which Job called persecution, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm" title="Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?">Job 19:22</a></span>.

His natural strength becomes more and more feeble, and his voice weaker and weaker. It is a feeling of sadness that prevails in the preceding description of suffering, and now even stamps the address to the friends with a tone of importunate entreaty which shall, if possible, affect their heart. They are indeed his friends, as the emphatic &#1512;&#1506;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; affirms; impelled towards him by sympathy they are come, and at least stand by him while all other men flee from him. They are therefore to grant him favour (&#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, prop. to incline to) in the place of right; it is enough that the hand of Eloah has touched him (in connection with this, one is reminded that leprosy is called &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;, and is pre-eminently accounted as plaga divina; wherefore the suffering Messiah also bears the significant name &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1491;&#1489;&#1497; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, "the leprous one from the school of Rabbi," in the Talmud, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>), they are not to make the divine decree heavier to him by their uncharitableness.
