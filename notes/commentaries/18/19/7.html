Severely has God dealt with him, but that severity of dealing has only drawn him nearer to God and made him trust the more. He groups together a rich variety of figures to express his desolate condition. He is suffering assault, and can get no protection or redress; he is imprisoned on every side, his hope is torn up like the tree of which he had before spoken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-7.htm" title="For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.">Job 14:7</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-7 Job's friends blamed him as a wicked man, because he was so afflicted; here he describes their unkindness, showing that what they condemned was capable of excuse. Harsh language from friends, greatly adds to the weight of afflictions: yet it is best not to lay it to heart, lest we harbour resentment. Rather let us look to Him who endured the contradiction of sinners against himself, and was treated with far more cruelty than Job was, or we can be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, I cry out of wrong - Margin, or "violence." The Hebrew word (&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;  cha&#770;ma&#770;s) means properly violence. The violence referred to is that which was brought upon him by God. It is, indeed, harsh language; but it is not quite sure that he means to complain of God for doing him injustice. God had dealt with him in a severe or violent manner, is the meaning, and he had cried unto him for relief, but had cried in vain.<p>No judgment - No justice. The meaning is, that he could obtain justice from no one God would not interpose to remove the calamities which he had brought upon him, and his friends would do no justice to his motives and character. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. wrong&#8212;violence: brought on him by God.<p>no judgment&#8212;God will not remove my calamities, and so vindicate my just cause; and my friends will not do justice to my past character.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I cry out, </span> to wit, unto God by prayer or appeal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of wrong; </span> that I am oppressed, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Or of "violence" (m), or injury done him by the Sabeans and Chaldeans upon his substance, and by Satan upon his health; this he cried out and complained of in prayer to God, and of it as it were in open court, as a violation of justice, and as being dealt very unjustly with: <p>but I am not heard; his prayer was not heard; he could get no relief, nor any redress of his grievances, nor any knowledge of the reasons of his being thus used; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a>; <p>I cry aloud, but there is no judgment; notwithstanding his vehement and importunate requests; and which were repeated time after time, that there might be a hearing of his cause; that it might be searched into and tried, that his innocence might be cleared, and justice done him, and vengeance taken on those that wronged him; but he could not obtain it; there was no time appointed for judgment, no court of judicature set, nor any to judge. Now seeing this was the case, that the hand of God was in all his afflictions; that he had complained to him of the injury done him; and that he had most earnestly desired his cause might be heard, and the reasons given why he was thus used, but could get no answer to all this; therefore it became them to be cautious and careful of what they said concerning the dealings of God with him, and to what account they placed them; of which he gives a particular enumeration in the following verses. <p>(m) "violentiam", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, &amp;c.
