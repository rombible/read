Fearing God, departing from evil, and still holding fast his integrity? </span>For thus do the three participles in Hebrew follow one another. Instead then of rendering the next word, <span class="ital">although thou movedst me; </span>he proposes reading, <span class="ital">And yet thou movest me; </span>or, to continue the interrogation, namely, <span class="ital">And dost thou, </span>or, <span class="ital">wilt thou, move me against him to destroy him without cause? </span>This, and the rest of this representation, respecting Satan’s <span class="ital">moving, </span>that is, persuading and prevailing with God, to bring, or to suffer this his enemy to bring, these grievous calamities upon Job, is not to be understood literally; as if God could be moved by any of his creatures, especially by Satan, to alter or depart from his own wise and holy purposes, which are all eternal and unchangeable, to gratify that evil spirit by granting his desires: but the design is simply to signify the devil’s restless malice, in promoting man’s misery, and God’s permission of it, for his own glory. <span class="ital">To destroy him without cause — </span>Without any signal guilt or special provocation, whereby he, more than others, deserved to be chastised by such heavy calamities; not but that there might be other very weighty causes for them: for the divine wisdom, we may be sure, neither does nor suffers any thing without cause; that is, without a sufficient reason. That good men are sometimes extremely afflicted, and that not only in their outward estate, but in their persons, as Job was, is too plain to be denied; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>;) and, whether God permits wicked spirits, or wicked men, or any thing else, to be the immediate instrument of a good man’s sufferings, makes no alteration as to the nature or degree of his sufferings. But the word <span class="greekheb">חנם</span><span class="ital">chinnam, </span>here rendered, <span class="ital">without cause, </span>may, with equal propriety, be translated, as it is <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-17.htm" title="Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.">Proverbs 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-10.htm" title="And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.">Ezekiel 6:10</a>, and elsewhere, <span class="ital">in vain; </span>and be referred, not to God’s <span class="ital">destroying </span>him, but to Satan’s moving God so to do. And then the reading will be, <span class="ital">Thou hast in vain moved, </span>or <span class="ital">dost, </span>or <span class="ital">wilt, in vain move me </span>to destroy him; that is, without effect, or to no purpose; for thou art not able to take away his integrity, which, in spite of all thy art and malice, he still holds fast. Thus Junius and Tremellius translate the words: <span class="ital">Hast thou considered my servant Job — that he still retains his integrity? and, in vain hast thou excited me to destroy him: </span>and Houbigant, <span class="ital">He still retains his integrity, after thou hast excited me against him, that I might trouble him, in vain.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-6. How well is it for us, that neither men nor devils are to be our judges! but all our judgment comes from the Lord, who never errs. Job holds fast his integrity still, as his weapon. God speaks with pleasure of the power of his own grace. Self-love and self-preservation are powerful in the hearts of men. But Satan accuses Job, representing him as wholly selfish, and minding nothing but his own ease and safety. Thus are the ways and people of God often falsely blamed by the devil and his agents. Permission is granted to Satan to make trial, but with a limit. If God did not chain up the roaring lion, how soon would he devour us! Job, thus slandered by Satan, was a type of Christ, the first prophecy of whom was, that Satan should bruise his heel, and be foiled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hast thou considered - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>.<p>That there is none like him in the earth - The same addition is made here by the Septuagint which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>; see the notes at that verse.<p>And still he holdeth fast his integrity - Notwithstanding all the efforts made to show that his piety was the result of mere selfishness. The word "integrity" here &#1514;&#1502;&#1492;  tu&#770;mma&#770;h means "perfection;" another form of the word which is rendered "perfect" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>; see the notes at that verse.<p>Although thou movedst me - The word rendered "movedst" &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  su&#770;th means to incite, to impel, to urge, to irritate against anyone; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-18.htm">Joshua 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-14.htm">Judges 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-2.htm">2 Chronicles 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-3.htm">Jeremiah 43:3</a>. The Septuagint renders this in a special manner, "And thou hast ordered (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  eipas) his property to be destroyed in vain" (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  diakene&#772;s), that is, without accomplishing the purpose intended.<p>To destroy him - The word used here (from &#1489;&#1500;&#1506;  bela&#8219;) means properly to swallow, to devour, with the idea of eagerness or greediness. It is then used in the sense of to consume, or destroy; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-18.htm">Job 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-15.htm">Psalm 69:15</a>. In the margin it is rendered "swallow him up."<p>Without cause - Without any sufficient reason. The cause assigned by Satan <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-9.htm">Job 1:9-11</a> was, that the piety of Job was selfish, and that if God should remove his possessions, he would show that he had no true religion. God says now that it was demonstrated that there was no reason for having made the trial. The result had shown that the charge was unfounded, and that his piety still remained, though he was stripped of all that he had. This passage may remind us of the speech of Neptune in favor of Aeneas, Iliad v. 297:<p>And can ye see this righteous chief atone<p>With guiltless blood for vices not his own?<p>To all the gods his constant vows were paid;<p>Sure though he wars for Troy he claims our aid.<p>Fate wills not this - Pope <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. integrity&#8212;literally, "completeness"; so "perfect," another form of the same Hebrew word, Job 11:7.<p>movedst &#8230; against&#8212;So 1Sa 26:19; compare 1Ch 21:1 with 2Sa 24:1.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Still, </span> notwithstanding all his trials and tribulations, and thy malicious suggestion to the contrary, he holdeth fast his integrity, i.e. he continues to be the same perfect and upright man which he was before. All thy endeavours to pull away his integrity have made him only to hold it the faster. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou movedst me, </span> i.e. didst persuade me, and prevailed with me to do it. But this, as the rest of this representation, is not to be understood properly, as if God could be moved by any of his creatures to alter his purposes, which are all eternal and unchangeable, and especially by Satan, as if God would gratify him by granting his desires; but the design of these words is to signify, both the devil’s restless malice in promoting man’s misery, and God’s permission of it for his own wise and holy ends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Without cause, </span> i.e. without any special provocation, whereby he, more than others, deserved such heavy punishments; which also Job himself oft allegeth for his justification, although he doth not deny himself to be a sinner, as is apparent from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm" title="I have sinned; what shall I do to you, O you preserver of men? why have you set me as a mark against you, so that I am a burden to myself?">Job 7:20</a>,21 9:2 13:23,26</span>; nor that sin deserves judgments.

So it is not referred to God’s destroying him, but to Satan’s moving God so to do. And so this place may be thus rendered exactly according to the Hebrew, and thou hast moved me to destroy him in vain, or without effect, or to no purpose, i.e. thou hast lost thy design and expectation therein, which was to take away his integrity, which in spite of all thy art and malice he still holdeth fast. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Satan, hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?.... The same with this is also before put unto Satan, and the same character given of Job, which is here continued and confirmed, with an addition to it; for Job was no loser, but a gainer in his character by his afflictions and trials: <p>and still he holdeth fast his integrity. The first man Adam was made upright, but by sinning he lost his integrity, and since the fall there is none in man naturally; it is only to be found in regenerate and renewed persons, who have right spirits renewed in them; by which principle of grace wrought in them they become upright in heart, and walk uprightly. The word used signifies "perfection" (o), which Job had not in himself, but in Christ; though it may denote the truth and sincerity of his grace, and the uprightness of his walk, and the simplicity of his conversation, the bias of his mind, and the tenor of his conduct and behaviour towards God and men; this principle he retained, this frame and disposition of soul continued with him, and he acted up to it in all things; he held fast his faith and confidence in the Lord his God, and he professed his cordial love and sincere affection for God, and his filial fear and reverence of him; and this he did still, notwithstanding all the assaults and temptations of Satan, and all the sore afflictions and trials he met with; an instance this of persevering grace, and of the truth of what Job after expresses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-9.htm">Job 17:9</a>; and this he did, even says the Lord to Satan: <p>although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause; not that Satan could work upon God as he does upon men, both good and bad, especially the latter; nor could he so work upon him as to cause him to change his mind and will, who is unchangeable in his nature and purposes; but the sense is, he made a motion to him, he proposed it, requested and entreated, and did not barely propose it, but urged it with importunity, was very solicitous to have it done; and he prevailed and succeeded according to God's own determinate counsel and will, though only in part; for he moved him to "destroy him", himself, his body, if not his soul; for this roaring lion seeks to devour men, even the sheep and lambs of Christ's flock: or "to swallow him up" (p), as the word signifies; that he might be delivered to him, who would make but one morsel of him, swallow him up alive, as a lion any creature, or any other beast of prey. Mr. Broughton renders it, "to undo him"; and we say of a man, when he has lost his substance, that he is undone; and in this sense Job was destroyed or undone, for he had lost his all: and this motion was made "without cause", there was no just reason for it; what Satan suggested, and the calumny he cast upon Job, was not supported by him, he could give no proof nor evidence of it; and it was in the issue and event "in vain", as the word (q) may be rendered; for he did not appear, notwithstanding all that was done to him, to be the man Satan said he was, nor to do the things, or say the words, Satan said he would. <p>(o) , Polychronius in Drusius; "perfectionem suam", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus.

That he maintained his godly fear when the benefits were taken away refuted the suspicion, and shewed that his trials were without cause.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou conquered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</span> Thus far is identical with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a> (<span class="accented">quod vide</span>). The rest of the verse is additional, having reference to the conduct of Job under his earlier trials (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20-22</a>). And still he holdeth fast his integrity. This has been justly called "the key-note of the whole book" (Cook). Satan had declared that Job's integrity rested on no solid basis, and would easily be overthrown and disappear. God, confident in his servant's faithfulness and truth, had allowed him to assail it. What was the result? God declares it with his own mouth. Job's "integrity" had not been wrested from him; he still maintained it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21, 22</a>), as he was about to do till the end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-1.htm">Job 42:1-6</a>).

"From the other side of the desert" is equivalent to, from its farthest end. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are the youthful sons and daughters of Job, according to the epicene use of &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; in the Pentateuch (youths and maidens). In one day Job is now bereft of everything which he accounted the gift of Jehovah, - his herds, and with these his servants, which he not only prizes as property, but for whom he has also a tender heart (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31.htm">Job 31</a>); last of all, even his dearest ones, his children. Satan has summoned the elements and men for the destruction of Job's possessions by repeated strokes. That men and nations can be excited by Satan to hostile enterprises, is nothing surprising (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>); but here, even the fire of God and the hurricane are attributed to him. Is this poetry or truth? Luther, in the Larger Catechism, question 4, says the same: "The devil causes strife, murder, rebellion, and war, also thunder and lightning, and hail, to destroy corn and cattle, to poison the atmosphere," etc., - a passage of our creed often ridiculed by rationalism; but it is correct if understood in accordance with Scripture, and not superstitiously. As among men, so in nature, since the Fall two different powers of divine anger and divine love are in operation: the mingling of these is the essence of the present Kosmos. Everything destructive to nature, and everything arising therefrom which is dangerous and fatal to the life of man, is the outward manifestation of the power of anger. In this power Satan has fortified himself; and this, which underlies the whole course of nature, he is able to make use of, so far as God may permit it as being subservient to His chief design (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>). He has no creative power. Fire and storm, by means of which he works, are of God; but he is allowed to excite these forces to hostility against man, just as he himself is become an instrument of evil. It is similar with human demonocracy, whose very being consists in placing itself en rapport with the hidden powers of nature. Satan is the great juggler, and has already manifested himself as such, even in paradise and in the temptation of Jesus Christ. There is in nature, as among men, an entanglement of contrary forces which he knows how to unloose, because it is the sphere of his special dominion; for the whole course of nature, in the change of its phenomena, is subject not only to abstract laws, but also to concrete supernatural powers, both bad and good. </body></html>
