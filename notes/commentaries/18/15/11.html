The Authorised Version gives very good sense, which seems to suit the context in the following verse; but it is susceptible of other phases of meaning: <span class= "ital">e.g</span>., “or a word that dealeth gently with thee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-5.htm" title="And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.">2Samuel 4:5</a>), such as ours have been (?)”; or “the word that he hath spoken softly with thee” (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm" title="Have you heard the secret of God? and do you restrain wisdom to yourself?">Job 15:8</a>); or, again, the consolations of God may mean strong consolations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-11.htm" title="She sent out her boughs to the sea, and her branches to the river.">Psalm 80:11</a>), such as ours have been, spoken in strong language,” in which case the second clause would mean, “Was thine own speech gentle?” “Small with thee” means, of course, <span class= "ital">too small for thee.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-11.htm" title="Are the consolations of God small with you? is there any secret thing with you?">Job 15:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Are the consolations of God small with thee? — </span>Are those blessings which we have pro-pounded to thee, on condition of thy repentance, small and inconsiderable in thine eyes? He takes it ill that Job did not value the comforts which he and his friends administered to him, more than, it seems, he did, and that he did not welcome every word they said as the truth of God. And he represents this as a slight put upon divine consolations in general, as if they were of small account with him; whereas, really, they were not: if Job had not highly valued them he could not have borne up as he did under his sufferings. It is true Job’s friends had said some very good things, but in their application of them to him they were miserable comforters. <span class="ital">Is there any secret thing with thee? — </span>Hast thou any secret and peculiar way of obtaining comfort, which is unknown to us, and to all other men? some cordial to support thee, that no body else can pretend to, or knows any thing of? Or, perhaps he means, Is there some secret sin harboured and indulged in thy bosom, which hinders thy reception of divine comforts? None disesteem divine consolations but those that secretly, if not openly, are attached to the world, and live after the flesh.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-16 Eliphaz begins a second attack upon Job, instead of being softened by his complaints. He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Are the consolations of God small with thee? - The "consolations of God" here refer probably to those considerations which had been suggested by Eliphaz and his friends, and which he takes to be the "consolations" which God had furnished for the afflicted. He asks whether they were regarded by Job as of little value? Whether he was not willing to take such consolations as God had provided, and to allow them to sustain him instead of permitting himself to inveigh against God? The Septuagint renders this, "thou hast been chastised less than thy sins deserve. Thou hast spoken with excessive haughtiness!" But the true idea seems to be, that Eliphaz regarded the considerations adduced by him and his friends, as the gracious consolations which God had provided for people in affliction, and as the results of all former reflections on the design of God in sending trial. He now represents Job as regarding them as of no value, and maintaining sentiments directly at variance with them. "Is there any secret thing with thee?"<p>Noyes renders this," and words so full of kindness to thee," that is, are they of no account to you? So Dr. Good and Wemyss, "or the addresses of kindness to thyself?" Luther translates it, "but thou hast, perhaps, yet a secret portion with thee." Rosenmuller, "and words most guilty spoken toward thee." The Septuagint renders it, "and thou hast spoken proudly beyond measure" - &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  megalo&#772;s huperballontas lelale&#772;kas. The word which occurs in the Hebrew - &#1500;&#1488;&#1496;  la&#770;'at&#803;, when it is a single word, and used as a verb, means to wrap around, to muffle, to cover, to conceal, and then to be "secret" - whence the Greek: &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;  latho&#772;, and &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  lanthano&#772;, and the Latin: lateo. In this sense it is understood here by our translators. But it may be also a compound word - from &#1488;&#1496;  'at&#803; - a gentle sound, murmur, whisper; from where it is used adverbially - &#1500;&#1488;&#1496;  le'at and &#1500;&#1488;&#1496;  la&#770;'at&#803; - gently, softly, slowly - as of the slow gait of a mourner, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; and of water gently flowing, as the water of Siloam, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a>. And hence, also, it may refer to words flowing kindly or gently toward anyone; and this seems to be the meaning here. Eliphaz asks whether Job could despise or undervalue the words spoken so gently and kindly toward him? A singular illustration, to be sure, of kindness, but still showing how the friends of Job estimated their own remarks. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. consolations&#8212;namely, the revelation which Eliphaz had stated as a consolatory reproof to Job, and which he repeats in Job 15:14.<p>secret&#8212;Hast thou some secret wisdom and source of consolation, which makes thee disregard those suggested by me? (Job 15:8). Rather, from a different Hebrew root, Is the word of kindness or gentleness addressed by me treated by thee as valueless?

Hast thou any secret and peculiar ground or way of comfort which is unknown to us, and to all other men, except thyself; for which, or in comparison of which, thou despisest our consolations as mean and trivial?

Meaning either those which Eliphaz and his friends had administered, when, upon his repentance and reformation, they promised him great and good things that should befall him and his family, and that his latter end should be greater than his beginning; which Job slighted, took no notice of, nor entertained any hope concerning it; and these they called the consolations of God, not only because great, as things excellent have the name of God added to them, to express their excellency, but because they were administered in the name of God, and were according to the word and will of God, at least as they thought: Ben Gersom renders it, "the consolations of these"; these were Bildad and Zophar; so Bar Tzemach; or, as others, "these consolations" (b) which I and my friends have suggested; but not human, rather divine consolations are meant; and this is a fresh charge against Job, that he made light of such, even the consolations of God, Father, Son, and Spirit, who are each of them comforters; saints may and should comfort one another, and ministers of the Gospel are Barnabases, sons of consolation; but God is the great Comforter, it is he only can speak and apply comfort to purpose; and his consolations are not to be accounted "small", if it be considered from whence they come, from the great God, the Creator, to creatures, dust and ashes, sinful ones, on whom they are bestowed, such as are undeserving of them, yea, deserving of the wrath of God, and the curses of his law; and also the nature of these comforts, as that they are strong consolations, and effectual through the power and grace of God, and are everlasting, the matter and foundation of them being so; and though they may be refused through unbelief, as being too great in the view of a sinful creature for himself yet they can never be accounted small, or slighted and despised by a gracious soul; nor can it be though they were by Job, since he was so distressed with the arrows of the Almighty, a sense of divine wrath, and was so desirous of the divine Presence, and even begged he might take comfort a little: <p>is there any secret thing with thee? any secret wisdom and knowledge which they were strangers to; or any secret way of conveying comfort to him they knew not of; or any secret sin in him, any Achan in the camp, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-11.htm">Joshua 7:11</a>, that hindered him from receiving comfort, or put him upon slighting what was offered to him. <p>(b)  "consolationes istorum virorum", Vatablus; "consolationes istae", so some in Drusius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Are</i> the consolations of God <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</span><p>(g) He accuses Job's pride and ingratitude, that will not be comforted by God, but by their counsel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">small with thee</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">are the consolations of God too small for thee</span>? do they seem to thee beneath thy deserts and notice? <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-9.htm" title="Seems it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?">Numbers 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-13.htm" title="And he said, Hear you now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?">Isaiah 7:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is there any secret thing with thee</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">and a word that dealt gently with thee</span>? The consolations or comforts of God are such as proceed from God and are authorized by Him. Eliphaz so describes his own teaching, e.g. the oracle, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm" title="Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof.">Job 4:12</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., which came directly from God; but also, no doubt, such consoling views of God’s providence as he shewed ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-8.htm" title="I would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause:">Job 5:8</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>. In the phrase “a word that dealt gently with thee” he describes the gentle and conciliatory manner of his own first speech. He may include his friends with him in all this, but there runs throughout this discourse an under-current of references to himself.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are the consolations of God small with thee?</span> By "the consolations of God" Eliphaz probably means the hopes which he and his friends had held out, speaking in God's Name, that if Job would humble himself, and confess his guilt, and sue to God for pardon, he would be restored to favour, recover his prosperity, and live to a good old age in tranquil happiness (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-20.htm">Job 8:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13-19</a>). He wishes to know if Job thinks lightly of all this, regards it as of small account, will make no effort to obtain the blessings held out to him. This is all reasonable enough from his standpoint, that Job is conscious of secret heinous guilt; but it can make no impression on Job, who is conscious of the reverse. <span class="cmt_word">Is there any secret thing with thee?</span> rather, <span class="accented">And is the word</span> [<span class="accented">of small account that dealeth</span>] <span class="accented">gently with thee?</span> Eliphaz considers that his own words and those of his two companions have been soft words, dealing "gently" with Job's refractoriness, and that Job ought to have been impressed by them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is not affirmative: forsooth (Hirz.), but, confirmatory and explicative. This opinion respecting him, which is so sharply and definitely expressed by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, thrusts itself irresistibly forward, for it is not necessary to know his life more exactly, his own mouth, whence such words escape, reveals his sad state: docet (&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; only in the book of Job, from &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, discere, a word which only occurs once in the Hebrew, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-25.htm">Proverbs 22:25</a>) culpam tuam os tuum, not as Schlottm. explains, with Raschi: docet culpa tua os tuum, which, to avoid being misunderstood, must have been &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; &#1514;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, and is a though unsuited to the connection. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; is certainly not directly equivalent to &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>; it signifies to teach, to explain, and this verb is just the one in the mouth of the censorious friend. What follows must not be translated: while thou choosest (Hirz.); &#1493;&#1514;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; is not a circumstantial clause, but adds a second confirmatory clause to the first: he chooses the language of the crafty, since he pretends to be able to prove his innocence before God; and convinced that he is in the right, assumes the offensive (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>.) against those who exhort him to humble himself. Thus by his evil words he becomes his own judge (&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498;) and accuser (&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493; &#1489;&#1498; after the fem. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-23.htm">Proverbs 26:23</a>). The knot of the controversy becomes constantly more entangled since Job strengthens the friends more and more in their false view by his speeches, which certainly are sinful in some parts (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>). </body></html>
