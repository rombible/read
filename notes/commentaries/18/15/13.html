He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That thou turnest thy spirit - That your mind is turned against God instead of acquiescing in his dealings.

To Eliphaz and his companions, the wild remonstrances of Job, his vehement expostulations and despairing outcries, are, one and all, nothing better than indications of a proud and rebellious spirit, that sets itself up against the Almighty, and openly contends with him. They view Job, after the speeches that he has made, as a declared rebel, and no longer regard it as incumbent upon them to use any "gentleness" in their reprimands. <span class="cmt_word">And lettest such words go out of thy mouth?</span> It is remarkable that neither Eliphaz nor either of his friends ever points out what <span class="accented">particular</span> words of Job they object to and regard as impious, so as to give him the opportunity of defending, explaining, or retracting them. They take refuge in vague generalities, with which it is impossible to grapple. But this vagueness and want of logical accuracy is characteristic of the Oriental nations, who scarcely ever reason cogently or bring matters to a point. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Wast thou as the first one born as a man,<p>And hast thou been brought forth before the hills?<p>  8  Hast thou attended to the counsel of Eloah,<p>And hast thou kept wisdom to thyself?<p>  9  What dost thou know that we have not known?<p>Doest thou understand what we have not been acquainted with?<p>10  Both grey-haired and aged are among us,<p>Older in days than thy father.<p>The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a> assumes that the first created man, because coming direct from the hand of God, had the most direct and profoundest insight into the mysteries of the world which came into existence at the same time as himself. Schlottman calls to mind an ironical proverbial expression of the Hindus: "Yea, indeed, he is the first man; no wonder that he is so wise" (Roberts, Orient. Illustr. p. 276). It is not to be translated: wast thou born as the first man, which is as inadmissible as the translation of &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>, by "a little" (vid., Khler in loc.); rather &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (i.e., &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-10.htm">Joshua 21:10</a>, formed from &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, like the Arabic ra&#305;&#770;s, from ras, if it is not perhaps a mere incorrect amalgamation of the forms &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8</a>) is in apposition with the subject, and &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is to be regarded as predicate, according to Ges. 139, 2. Raschi's translation is also impossible: wast thou born before Adam? for this Greek form of expression, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-30.htm">John 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a> (comp. Odyss. xi. 481f., &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), is strange to the Hebrew. In the parallel question, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>, Umbr., Schlottm., and Renan (following Ewald) see a play upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24</a>.: art thou the demiurgic Wisdom itself? But the introductory proverbs (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1.htm">Proverbs 1-9</a>) are more recent than the book of Job (vid., supra, p. 24), and indeed probably, as we shall show elsewhere, belong to the time of Jehoshaphat. Consequently the more probable relation is that the writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24</a>. has adopted words from the book of Job in describing the pre-existence of the Chokma. Was Job, a higher spirit-nature, brought forth, i.e., as it were amidst the pangs of travail (&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514;, Pulal from &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;), before the hills? for the angels, according to Scripture, were created before man, and even before the visible universe (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>.). Hirz., Ew., Schlottm., and others erroneously translate the futt. in the questions, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, as praes. All the verbs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, are under the control of the retrospective character which is given to the verses by &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>., where &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488; has the same influence, and also <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>, where the historical sense of &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491; depends not upon the syntax, but upon logical necessity. Translate therefore: didst thou attend in the secret council (&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>) of Eloah (according to the correct form of writing in Codd. and in Kimchi, Michlol 54a, &#1492;&#1489;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-11.htm">Job 15:11</a> &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13</a> &#1492;&#1489;&#1506;&#1491;, with Beth raph. and without Gaja),<p>(Note: As a rule, the interrogative He, when pointed with Pathach, has Gaja against the Pathach <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a>; this, however, falls away (among other instances) when the syllable immediately following the He has the tone, as in the two examples given above (comp. also &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>; &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-7.htm">Job 13:7</a>), or the usual Gaja (Metheg) which stands in the antepenultima (Br, Metheg-Setzung, 23)<p>and didst then acquire for thyself (&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;, here attrahere, like the Arabic, sorbere, to suck in) wisdom? by which one is reminded of Prometheus' fire stolen from heaven. Nay, Job can boast of no extraordinary wisdom. The friends - as Eliphaz, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9</a>, says in their name - are his contemporaries; and if he desires to appeal to the teaching of his father, and of his ancestors generally, let them know that there are hoary-headed men among themselves, whose discernment is deeper by reason of their more advanced age. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; is inverted, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a> (which see); and at the same time, since it is sued twice, it is correlative: etiam inter nos et cani et senes. Most modern expositors think that Eliphaz, "in modestly concealed language" (Ewald), refers to himself. But the reference would be obvious enough; and wherefore this modest concealing, which is so little suited to the character of Eliphaz? Moreover, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a> does not sound as if speaking merely of one, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a> Eliphaz would make himself older than he appears to be, for it is nowhere implied that Job is a young man in comparison with him. We therefore with Umbreit explain &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;: in our generation. Thus it sounds more like the Arabic, both in words (keb&#305;&#770;r Arab., usual in the signif. grandaevus) and in substance. Eliphaz appeals to the source of reliable tradition, since they have even among their races and districts mature old men, and since, indeed, according to Job's own admission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>), there is "wisdom among the ancient ones." </body></html>
