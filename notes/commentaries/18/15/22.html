But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour.

Professor Lee compares the words of Cain, "It shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14  What is mortal man that he should be pure,<p>And that he who is born of woman should be righteous?<p>15  He trusteth not His holy ones,<p>And the heavens are not pure in His eyes:<p>16  How much less the abominable and corrupt,<p>Man, who drinketh iniquity as water!<p>The exclamation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a> is like the utterance: mortal man and man born flesh of flesh cannot be entirely sinless. Even "the holy ones" and "the heavens" are not. The former are, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>, the angels as beings of light (whether &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to be light from the very first, spotlessly pure, or, vid., Psalter, i. 588f., to be separated, distinct, and hence exalted above what is common); the latter is not another expression for the &#1488;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1488; (Targ.), the "angels of the heights," but &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is the word used for the highest spheres in which they dwell (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-5.htm">Job 25:5</a>); for the angels are certainly not corporeal, but, like all created things, in space, and the Scriptures everywhere speak of angels and the starry heavens together. Hence the angels are called the morning stars in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>, and hence both stars and angels are called &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (vid., Genesis. S. 128). Even the angels and the heavens are finite, and consequently are not of a nature absolutely raised above the possibility of sin and contamination.<p>Eliphaz repeats here what he has already said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>.; but he does it intentionally, since he wishes still more terribly to describe human uncleanness to Job (Oetinger). In that passage &#1488;&#1507; was merely the sign of an anti-climax, here &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507; is quanto minus. Eliphaz refers to the hereditary infirmity and sin of human nature in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>, here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>) to man's own free choice of that which works his destruction. He uses the strongest imaginable words to describe one actualiter and originaliter corrupted. &#1504;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489; denotes one who is become an abomination, or the abominated  equals  abominable (Ges. 134, 1); &#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1495;, one thoroughly corrupted (Arabic alacha, in the medial VIII conjugation: to become sour, which reminds one of &#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;, Rabb. &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, as an image of evil, and especially of evil desire). It is further said of him (an expression which Elihu adopts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>), that he drinks up evil like water. The figure is like <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a>, comp. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/73-10.htm">Psalm 73:10</a>, and implies that he lusts after sin, and that it is become a necessity of his nature, and is to his nature what water is to the thirsty. Even Job does not deny this corruption of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>), but the inferences which the friends draw in reference to him he cannot acknowledge. The continuation of Eliphaz' speech shows how they render this acknowledgment impossible to him. </body></html>
