He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What is man that he should be clean? - The object of Eliphaz in this is to overturn the positions of Job that he was righteous, and had been punished beyond his deserts. He had before maintained <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7</a>, that no one ever perished being innocent, and that the righteous were not cut off. This was with him a favorite position; and indeed the whole drift of the argument maintained by him and his friends was, to prove that uncommon calamities were proof of uncommon guilt. Job had insisted on it that he was a righteous man, and had not deserved the calamities which had come upon him - a position which Eliphaz seems to have regarded as an assertion of innocence. To meet this he now maintains that no one is righteous; that all that are born of women are guilty; and in proof of this he goes back to the oracle which had made so deep an impression on his mind, and to the declaration then made to him that no one was pure before God; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4.htm">Job 4</a>:He does not repeat it exactly as the oracle was then delivered to him, but adverts to the substance of it, and regards it as final and indisputable. The meaning is, "What are all the pretensions of man to purity, when even the angels are regarded as impure and the heavens unclean?"<p>He which is born of a woman - Another mode of denoting man. No particular argument to maintain the doctrine of man's depravity is couched in the fact that he is born of a woman. The sense is, simply, how can anyone of the human family be pure? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Frail, feeble, mortal man, or woeful man, as Mr. Broughton renders it; since he is sinful, whereby he is become such a weak and dying creature: this question, as well as the following, is put by way of contempt, and as lessening man in a comparative sense, and in order to abate any high conceit of himself; who is not naturally clean, but the reverse, being conceived and born in sin; nor can he be so of himself, nor by any means he is capable of; and however clean he may be in his own eyes, or in the eyes of others, yet is not clean in the sight of God, and still less pure than him, his Maker, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17</a>; and indeed cannot be clean at all, but through the grace of God, and blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin: <p>and he which is born of a woman; a periphrasis of man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1</a>; <p>that he should be righteous? as no man is naturally; there is none righteous, no, not one; though man originally was made righteous, yet sinning he lost his righteousness, and all his posterity are without any; nor can they become righteous of themselves, or by any works of righteousness done by them; and though they may trust in themselves that they are righteous, and may appear outwardly so before men, yet by the deeds of the law no flesh can be justified or accounted righteous in the sight of God, and much less be more just than he, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17</a>; nor can any of the sons of men be made or reckoned righteous but by the obedience of Christ, or by that justifying righteousness that is in him: what Eliphaz here says concerning the impurity, imperfection, and unrighteousness of men, are very great truths; but if he aims at Job, as he seems to do he misses his mark, and mistakes the man, and it is in vain with respect to him, or as a refutation of any notions of his; for Job asserts the corruption and depravity of human nature as strongly as it is expressed here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>; nor does he ever claim, but disclaims, sinless perfection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20</a>; nor did he expect to be personally justified before God by any righteousness of his own, the imperfection of which he was sensible of, but by the righteousness of his living Redeemer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>; but what he pleaded for was the integrity and uprightness of his heart in opposition to hypocrisy he was charged with; and the holiness and righteousness of his life and conversation, in opposition to a course of living in sin, or to his being guilty of some notorious sin or sins for which he was afflicted, as was insinuated. Eliphaz here recurs to his oracle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17</a>; and expresses it much to the same sense. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What <i>is</i> man, that he should be clean? and <i>he which is</i> born of a woman, that he should <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> be righteous?</span><p>(i) His purpose is to prove that Job, as an unjust man and a hypocrite, is punished for his sins, as he did before, Job 4:8.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

Eliphaz had asserted the same truth in his first speech, when he said, "Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker? Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he taxeth with folly: <span class="accented">how m</span>u<span class="accented">ch less in them that dwell in houses of clay</span> whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17-19</a>); and Job had given his full assent to it, when he exclaimed, "I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2, 3</a>). The true question was not whether Job or any other man was" clean," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wholly <span class="accented">sinless</span> but whether Job had sinned so deeply and grievously that his sufferings were the natural and just punishment for his sins.

The clause is a mere variant of the preceding one. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Wast thou as the first one born as a man,<p>And hast thou been brought forth before the hills?<p>  8  Hast thou attended to the counsel of Eloah,<p>And hast thou kept wisdom to thyself?<p>  9  What dost thou know that we have not known?<p>Doest thou understand what we have not been acquainted with?<p>10  Both grey-haired and aged are among us,<p>Older in days than thy father.<p>The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a> assumes that the first created man, because coming direct from the hand of God, had the most direct and profoundest insight into the mysteries of the world which came into existence at the same time as himself. Schlottman calls to mind an ironical proverbial expression of the Hindus: "Yea, indeed, he is the first man; no wonder that he is so wise" (Roberts, Orient. Illustr. p. 276). It is not to be translated: wast thou born as the first man, which is as inadmissible as the translation of &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>, by "a little" (vid., Khler in loc.); rather &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (i.e., &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-10.htm">Joshua 21:10</a>, formed from &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, like the Arabic ra&#305;&#770;s, from ras, if it is not perhaps a mere incorrect amalgamation of the forms &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8</a>) is in apposition with the subject, and &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is to be regarded as predicate, according to Ges. 139, 2. Raschi's translation is also impossible: wast thou born before Adam? for this Greek form of expression, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-30.htm">John 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a> (comp.

In the parallel question, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>, Umbr., Schlottm., and Renan (following Ewald) see a play upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24</a>.: art thou the demiurgic Wisdom itself? But the introductory proverbs (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1.htm">Proverbs 1-9</a>) are more recent than the book of Job (vid., supra, p. 24), and indeed probably, as we shall show elsewhere, belong to the time of Jehoshaphat. Consequently the more probable relation is that the writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24</a>. has adopted words from the book of Job in describing the pre-existence of the Chokma. Was Job, a higher spirit-nature, brought forth, i.e., as it were amidst the pangs of travail (&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514;, Pulal from &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;), before the hills? for the angels, according to Scripture, were created before man, and even before the visible universe (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>.). Hirz., Ew., Schlottm., and others erroneously translate the futt. in the questions, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, as praes. All the verbs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, are under the control of the retrospective character which is given to the verses by &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>., where &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488; has the same influence, and also <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>, where the historical sense of &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491; depends not upon the syntax, but upon logical necessity. Translate therefore: didst thou attend in the secret council (&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>) of Eloah (according to the correct form of writing in Codd. and in Kimchi, Michlol 54a, &#1492;&#1489;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-11.htm">Job 15:11</a> &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13</a> &#1492;&#1489;&#1506;&#1491;, with Beth raph. and without Gaja),<p>(Note: As a rule, the interrogative He, when pointed with Pathach, has Gaja against the Pathach <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a>; this, however, falls away (among other instances) when the syllable immediately following the He has the tone, as in the two examples given above (comp. also &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>; &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-7.htm">Job 13:7</a>), or the usual Gaja (Metheg) which stands in the antepenultima (Br, Metheg-Setzung, 23)<p>and didst then acquire for thyself (&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;, here attrahere, like the Arabic, sorbere, to suck in) wisdom? by which one is reminded of Prometheus' fire stolen from heaven. Nay, Job can boast of no extraordinary wisdom. The friends - as Eliphaz, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9</a>, says in their name - are his contemporaries; and if he desires to appeal to the teaching of his father, and of his ancestors generally, let them know that there are hoary-headed men among themselves, whose discernment is deeper by reason of their more advanced age. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; is inverted, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a> (which see); and at the same time, since it is sued twice, it is correlative: etiam inter nos et cani et senes. Most modern expositors think that Eliphaz, "in modestly concealed language" (Ewald), refers to himself. But the reference would be obvious enough; and wherefore this modest concealing, which is so little suited to the character of Eliphaz? Moreover, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a> does not sound as if speaking merely of one, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a> Eliphaz would make himself older than he appears to be, for it is nowhere implied that Job is a young man in comparison with him. We therefore with Umbreit explain &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;: in our generation. Thus it sounds more like the Arabic, both in words (keb&#305;&#770;r Arab., usual in the signif. grandaevus) and in substance. Eliphaz appeals to the source of reliable tradition, since they have even among their races and districts mature old men, and since, indeed, according to Job's own admission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>), there is "wisdom among the ancient ones." </body></html>
