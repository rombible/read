He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thine own mouth condemneth thee - That is, the sentiments which you have uttered show that you cannot be a pious man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The many sufferings which God inflicts on him in the course of his life are not meant; &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495; does not signify here: continually, without intermission, as most expositors explain, but as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-7.htm">Job 20:7</a>, and throughout the book: for ever (Rosenm., Hahn, Welte). God gives him the death-stroke which puts an end to his life for ever, he passes away &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>); disfiguring his countenance, i.e., in the struggle of death and in death by the gradual working of decay, distorting and making him unlike himself, He thrusts him out of this life (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23</a>). The waw consec. is used here as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-27.htm">Psalm 118:27</a>.<p>When he is descended into Hades he knows nothing more of the fortune of his children, for as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:6</a> says: the dead have absolutely no portion in anything that happens under the sun. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-21.htm">Job 14:21</a> Job does not think of his own children that have died, nor his grandchildren (Ewald); he speaks of mankind in general. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; and &#1510;&#1506;&#1512; are not here placed in contrast in the sense of much and little, but, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-19.htm">Jeremiah 30:19</a>, in the wider sense of an important or a destitute position; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;, to be honoured, to attain to honour, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-5.htm">Isaiah 66:5</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; (to observe anything) is joined with &#1500; of the object, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a> (on the other hand, &#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-1.htm">Job 13:1</a>, was taken as dat. ethicus). He neither knows nor cares anything about the welfare of those who survive him: "Nothing but pain and sadness is the existence of the dead; and the pain of his own flesh, the sadness of his own soul, alone engage him. He has therefore no room for rejoicing, nor does the joyous or sorrowful estate of others, though his nearest ones, affect him" (Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i. 495). This is certainly, as Ewald and Psychol. S. 444, the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-22.htm">Job 14:22</a>; but &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is hardly to be translated with Hofmann "in him," so that it gives the intensive force of &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; to the suff. For it is improbable that in this connection, - where the indifference of the deceased respecting others, and the absolute reference to himself of the existence of pain on his own account, are contrasted, - &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-22.htm">Job 14:22</a>, is to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-16.htm">Job 30:16</a> (Psychol. S. 152), but rather objectively (over him). On the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-22.htm">Job 14:22</a> is not to be translated: over himself only does his flesh feel pain (Schlottm., Hirz., and others); for the flesh as inanimate may indeed be poetically, so to speak zeugmatically, represented as conscious of pain, but not as referring its pain to another, and consequently as self-conscious. On this account, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-22.htm">Job 14:22</a>, is to be taken in the signification, over him  equals  upon him, or as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-22.htm">Job 14:22</a> (beyond him), which is doubtful; or it signifies, as we have sought to render it in our translation in both cases, propter eum. Only on his own account does his flesh suffer, i.e., only applying to himself, only on his own account does his soul mourn, i.e., only over his own condition. He has no knowledge and interest that extends beyond himself; only he himself is the object of that which takes place with his flesh in the grave, and of that on which his soul reflects below in the depths of Hades. According to this interpretation &#1488;&#1498; belongs to &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, after the hyperbaton described at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a>. And he &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-22.htm">Job 14:22</a>, implies the idea (which is clearly expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>, and especially in Judith 16:17: &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) that the process of the decomposition of the body is a source of pain and sorrow to the departed spirit, - a conception which proceeds from the supposition, right in itself, that a connection between body and soul is still continued beyond the grave, - a connection which is assumed by the resurrection, but which, as Job viewed it, only made the future still more sorrowful.<p>This speech of Job (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12.htm">Job 12-14</a>), which closes here, falls into three parts, which correspond to the divisions into chapters. In the impassioned speech of Zophar, who treats Job as an empty and conceited babbler, the one-sided dogmatical standpoint of the friends was maintained with such arrogance and assumption, that Job is obliged to put forth all his power in self-defence. The first part of the speech (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12.htm">Job 12</a>) triumphantly puts down this arrogance and assumption. Job replies that the wisdom, of which they profess to be the only possessors, is nothing remarkable, and the contempt with which they treat him is the common lot of the innocent, while the prosperity of the ungodly remains undisturbed. In order, however, to prove to them that what they say of the majesty of God, before which he should humble himself, can neither overawe nor help him, he refers them to creation, which in its varied works testifies to this majesty, this creative power of God, and the absolute dependence of every living thin on Him, and proves that he is not wanting in an appreciation of the truth contained in the sayings of the ancients by a description of the absolute majesty of God as it is manifested in the works of nature, and especially in the history of man, which excels everything that the three had said. This description is, however, throughout a gloomy picture of disasters which God brings about in the world, corresponding to the gloomy condition of mind in which Job is, and the disaster which is come upon himself.<p>As the friends have failed to solace him by their descriptions of God, so his own description is also utterly devoid of comfort. For the wisdom of God, of which he speaks, is not the wisdom that orders the world in which one can confide, and in which one has the surety of seeing every mystery of life sooner or later gloriously solved; but this wisdom is something purely negative, and repulsive rather than attractive, it is abstract exaltation over all created wisdom, whence it follows that he puts to shame the wisdom of the wise. Of the justice of God he does not speak at all, for in the narrow idea of the friends he cannot recognise its control; and of the love of God he speaks as little as the friends, for as the sight of the divine love is removed from them by the one-sidedness of their dogma, so is it from him by the feeling of the wrath of God which at present has possession of his whole being. Hegel has called the religion of the Old Testament the religion of sublimity (die Religion der Erhabenheit); and it is true that, so long as that manifestation of love, the incarnation of the Godhead, was not yet realized, God must have relatively transcended the religious consciousness. From the book of Job, however, this view can be brought back to its right limits; for, according to the tendency of the book, neither the idea of God presented by the friends nor by Job is the pure undimmed notion of God that belongs to the Old Testament. The friends conceive of God as the absolute One, who acts only according to justice; Job conceives of Him as the absolute One, who acts according to the arbitrariness of His absolute power. According to the idea of the book, the former is dogmatic one-sidedness, the latter the conception of one passing through temptation. The God of the Old Testament consequently rules neither according to justice alone, nor according to a "sublime whim."<p>After having proved his superiority over the friends in perception of the majesty of God, Job tells them his decision, that he shall turn away from them. The sermon they address to him is to no purpose, and in fact produces an effect the reverse of that intended by them. And while it does Job no good, it injures them, because their very defence of the honour of God incriminates themselves in the eyes of God. Their aim is missed by them, for the thought of the absolute majesty of God has no power to impart comfort to any kind of sufferer; nor can the thought of His absolute justice give any solace to a sufferer who is conscious that he suffers innocently. By their confidence that Job's affliction is a decree of the justice of God, they certainly seem to defend the honour of God; but this defence is reversed as soon as it is manifest that there exists no such just ground for inflicting punishment on him. Job's self-consciousness, however, which cannot be shaken, gives no testimony to its justice; their advocacy of God is therefore an injustice to Job, and a miserable attempt at doing God service, which cannot escape the undisguised punishment of God. It is to be carefully noted that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-6.htm">Job 13:6-12</a> Job seriously warns the friends that God will punish them for their partiality, i.e., that they have endeavoured to defend Him at the expense of truth.<p>We see from this how sound Job's idea of God is, so far as it is not affected by the change which seems, according to the light which his temptation casts upon his affliction, to have taken place in his personal relationship to God. While above, ch. 9, he did not acknowledge an objective right, and the rather evaded the thought, of God's dealing unjustly towards him, by the desperate assertion that what God does is in every case right because God does it, he here recognises an objective truth, which cannot be denied, even in favour of God, and the denial of which, even though it were a pientissima fraus, is strictly punished by God. God is the God of truth, and will therefore be neither defended nor honoured by any perverting of the truth. By such pious lies the friends involve themselves in guilt, since in opposition to their better knowledge they regard Job as unrighteous, and blind themselves to the incongruities of daily experience and the justice of God. Job will therefore have nothing more to do with them; and to whom does he now turn? Repelled by men, he feels all the more strongly drawn to God. He desires to carry his cause before God. He certainly considers God to be his enemy, but, like David, he thinks it is better to fall into the hands of God than into the hands of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-14.htm">2 Samuel 24:14</a>). He will plead his cause with God, and prove to Him his innocence: he will do it, even though he be obliged to expiate his boldness with his life; for he knows that morally he will not be overcome in the contest. He requires compliance with but two conditions: that God would grant a temporary alleviation of his pain, and that He would not overawe him with the display of His majesty. Job's disputing with God is as terrible as it is pitiable. It is terrible, because he uplifts himself, Titan-like, against God; and pitiable, because the God against which he fights is not the God he has known, but a God that he is unable to recognise, - the phantom which the temptation has presented before his dim vision instead of the true God. This phantom is still the real God to him, but in other respects in no way differing from the inexorable ruling fate of the Greek tragedy. As in this the hero of the drama seeks to maintain his personal freedom against the mysterious power that is crushing him with an iron arm, so Job, even at the risk of sudden destruction, maintains the stedfast conviction of his innocence, in opposition to a God who has devoted him, as an evil-doer, to slow but certain destruction. The battle of freedom against necessity is the same as in the Greek tragedy. Accordingly one is obliged to regard it as an error, arising from simple ignorance, when it has been recently maintained that the boundless oriental imagination is not equal to such a truly exalted task as that of representing in art and poetry the power of the human spirit, and the maintenance of its dignity in the conflict with hostile powers, because a task that can only be accomplished by an imagination formed with a perception of the importance of recognising ascertained phenomena.<p>(Note: Vid., Arnold Ruge, Die Academie, i. S. 29.)<p>In treating this subject, the book of Job not only attains to, but rises far above, the height attained by the Greek tragedy: for, on the one hand, it brings this conflict before us in all the fearful earnestness of a death-struggle; on the other, however, it does not leave us to the cheerless delusion that an absolute caprice moulds human destiny. This tragic conflict with the divine necessity is but the middle, not the beginning nor the end, of the book; for this god of fate is not the real God, but a delusion of Job's temptation. Human freedom does not succumb, but it comes forth from the battle, which is a refining fire to it, as conqueror. The dualism, which the Greek tragedy leaves unexplained, is here cleared up. The book certainly presents much which, from its tragic character, suggests this idea of destiny, but it is not its final aim - it goes far beyond: it does not end in the destruction of its hero by fate; but the end is the destruction of the idea of this fate itself.<p>continued...</body></html>
