But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour.

The image here is taken from the mode in which people rushed into battle. It was with a violent concussion, and usually with a shout, that they might intimidate their foes, and overcome them at first, with the violence of the shock. The mode of warfare is now changed, and it is the vaunted excellency of modern warfare that armies now go deliberately and calmly to put each other to death.<p>Even "on his neck - literally, "with the neck" - &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1488;&#1512;  betsava&#772;'r. Vulgate, "With erect neck - erecto collo." Septuagint, contemptuously, or with pride - &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  hubrei. The idea seems to be, not that he ran "upon the neck" of his adversary - as would seem to be implied in our translation - but that he ran in a firm, haughty, confident manner; with a head erect and firm, as the indication of self confidence, and a determined purpose to overcome his foe. See Schultens in loc.<p>Upon the thick bosses - The word boss with us means a knob - a protuberant ornament of silver, brass, or ivory on a harness or a bridle; then a protuberant part, a prominence, or a round or swelling body of any kind. The Hebrew word used here (&#1490;&#1489;  gab) means properly anything gibbous, convex, arched; and hence, "the back" - as of animals. Applied to a shield, it means the convex part or the back of it - the part which was presented to an enemy, and which was made swelling and strong, called by the Greeks &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  omfalos, or &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  mesomfalion. Gesenius supposes that the metaphor here is taken from soldiers, who joined their shields together, and thus rushed upon an enemy. This was one mode of ancient warfare, when an army or a phalanx united their shields in front, so that nothing could penetrate them, or so united them over their heads when approaching a fortress, that they could safely march under them as a covering.<p>This, among the Romans and Greeks, was commonly practiced when approaching a besieged town. One form of the testudo - the &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b7; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  chelo&#772;ne&#772; stratio&#772;to&#772;n of the Greeks, was formed by the soldiers, pressed close together and holding their shields over their heads in such a manner as to form a compact covering. John H. Eschenburg, Manual of Classical Literature. by N. W. Fiske, pt. III, section 147. The Vulgate renders this, "and he is armed with a fat neck" - pingui cervice armatus est. Schultens expresses the idea that is adopted by Gesenius, and refers to Arabic customs to show that shields were thus united in defending an army from a foe, or in making an attack on them. He says, also, that it is a common expression - a proverb - among the Arabs, "he turns the back of his shield" to denote that one is an adversary; and quotes a passage from Hamasa, "When a friend meets me with base suspicions, I turn to him the back of my shield - a proverb, whose origin is derived from the fact, that a warrior turns the back of his shield to his foes."<p>Paxton supposes that the expression here is taken from single combat, which early prevailed. But the idea here is not that which our translation would seem to convey. It is not that he rushes upon or against the hard or thick shield "of the Almighty" - and that, therefore, he must meet resistance and be overcome: it is that he rushes upon God with his own shield. He puts himself in the attitude of a warrior. He turns the boss of his own shield against God, and becomes his antagonist. He is his enemy. The omission of the word "with" in the passage - or the preposition which is in the Hebrew (&#1489; b) has led to this erroneous translation. The passage is often quoted in a popular manner to denote that the sinner rushes upon God, "and must meet resistance" from his shield, or be overcome. It should be quoted only to denote that the sinner places himself in an attitude of opposition to God, and is his enemy.<p>Of his bucklers - Of his shields (&#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;  meg&#305;&#770;na&#772;y), that is, of the shields which the sinner has; not the shields of God. The shield was a well-known instrument of war, usually made with a rim of wood or metal, and covered with skins, and carried on the left arm; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a>. The outer surface was made rounding from the center to the edge, and was smoothly polished, so that darts or arrows would glide off and not penetrate. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. on his neck&#8212;rather, "with outstretched neck," namely, that of the rebel [Umbreit] (Ps 75:5).<p>upon &#8230; bucklers&#8212;rather, "with&#8212;his (the rebel's, not God's) bucklers."

As a fierce and furious enemy runs upon another with great wrath and fury; as the he goat in Daniel's vision ran upon the ram, in the fury of his power, that is, Alexander upon Darius; which instance Bar Tzemach refers to; and as an adversary, who throws down his weapons, and goes in to closer quarters, and takes his antagonist by the throat, or round the neck, in order to throw him down to the ground; in such a bold and insolent manner does the wicked man encounter with God; he makes up to him, and flies in his face, and most audaciously attacks him: or he runs upon him "with his neck" (y); with a stretched out neck, in the most haughty manner, with a neck like an iron sinew, and with a brow like brass: <p>upon the thick bosses of his bucklers; alluding to shields, embossed in the middle, where they are thicker than in the other parts, and used to have a spike of iron set in the middle; so that it was daring and dangerous to run upon them: these may design the perfections of God, denied by the wicked man; or his providential dispensations, despised by him; or his purposes and decrees ridiculed, replied unto, and disputed; or the flaming sword of justice, and the curses of a righteous law, in defiance of which wicked men go on in sin: or "with the bosses of his bucklers" (z); with all his family, as Schmidt; or employing all his wealth and riches, his power and authority, against God, and the interest of religion in the world. Some understand this of God, meeting the wicked man, stretching out his hand, and strengthening himself against him, as if he, God, ran upon the wicked man, and upon his neck, and took him by it, and shook him; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-12.htm">Job 16:12</a>; and upon the thick bosses of his buckler, his bones and nerves, as Mr. Broughton; or on his power and wealth, which are not able to secure him from the vengeance of the Almighty; but the former sense seems best. <p>(y) "erecto collo", V.

The thought expressed by the Targ., Syr., and Jerome would be suitable: and the number of the years (that he has to live unpunished) is hidden from the tyrant; but if this were the poet's meaning, he would have written &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, and must have written &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;.<p>With regard to the following <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-24</a>, it is doubtful whether only the evil-doer's anxiety of spirit is described in amplification of &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, or also how the terrible images from which he suffers in his conscience are realized, and how he at length helplessly succumbs to the destruction which his imagination had long foreboded. A satisfactory and decisive answer to this question is hardly possible; but considering that the real crisis is brought on by Eliphaz later, and fully described, it seems more probable that what has an objective tone in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-24</a> is controlled by what has been affirmed respecting the evil conscience of the ungodly, and is to be understood accordingly. The sound of terrible things (startling dangers) rings in his ears; the devastator comes upon him (&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; seq. acc. as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>) in the midst of his prosperity.

Another Targum translation (in Nachmani and elsewhere) is: sicut rex qui paratus est circumdare se legionibus. According to this, &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512; comes from &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;, to surround, be round (comp. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, whence &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, Assyr. cudar, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, perhaps also &#1492;&#1494;&#1512;, Syr. &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;, whence chedor, a circle, round about); and it is assumed, that as &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; signifies a ball (not only in Talmudic, but also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>, which is to be translated: rolling he rolleth thee into a ball, a ball in a spacious land), so &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, a round encampment, an army encamped in a circle, synon. of &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;. In the first signification the word certainly furnishes no suitable sense in connection with &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491;; but one may, with Kimchi, suppose that &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, like the Italian torniamento, denotes the circle as well as the tournament, or the round of conflict, i.e., the conflict which moves round about, like tumult of battle, which last is a suitable meaning here. The same appropriate meaning is attained, however, if the root is taken, like the Arabic kdr, in the signification turbidum esse (comp. &#1511;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>), which is adopted of misfortunes as troubled experiences of life (according to which Schultens translates: destinatus est ad turbulentissimas fortunas, beginning a new thought with &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491;, which is not possible, since &#1499;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; by itself is no complete figure), and may perhaps also be referred to the tumult of battle, tumultus bellici conturbatio (Rosenm.); or of, with Fleischer, one starts from another turn of the idea of the root, viz., to be compressed, solid, thick, which is a more certain way gives the meaning of a dense crowd.<p>(Note: The Arab. verb kdr belongs to the root kd, to smite, thrust, quatere, percutere, tundere, trudere; a root that has many branches. It is I. transitive cadara (fut. jacduru, inf. cadr) - by the non-adoption of which from the original lexicons our lexicographers have deprived the whole etymological development of its groundwork - in the signification to pour, hurl down, pour out, e.g., cadara-l-ma, he has spilt, poured out, thrown down the water; hence in the medial VII. form incadara intransitive, to fall, fall down, chiefly of water and other fluids, as of the rain which pours down from heaven, of a cascade, and the like; then improperly of a bird of prey which shoots down from the air upon its prey (e.g., in the poetry in Beidhwi on Sur. 81, 2: "The hawk saw some bustards on the plain f'ancadara, and rushed down"); of a hostile host which rushes upon the enemy first possible signification for &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;]; of a man, horse, etc., which runs very swiftly, effuse currit, effuso curru ruit; of the stars that shall fall from heaven at the last day (Sur. 81, 2). Then also II. intransitive cadara (fut. jacdiru) with the secondary form cadira (fut. jacdaru) and cadura (fut. jacduru), prop. to be shaken and jolted; then also of fluid things, mixed and mingled, made turgid, unclean, i.e., by shaking, jolting, stirring, etc., with the dregs (the cudre or cudde); then gen. turbidum, non limpidum (opp. Arab. s&#803;f'), with a similar transition of meaning to that in turbare (comp. deturbare) and the German trben (comp. traben or trappen, treiben, treffen). The primary meaning of the root takes another III. turn in the derived adjectives cudur, cudurr, cundur, cundir, compressed, solid, thick; the last word with us (Germans) forms a transition from cadir, cadr, cadr, dull, slimy, yeasty, etc., inasmuch as we speak of dickes Bier (thick beer), etc., cerevisia spissa, de la bire paisse. Here the point of contact of the word &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, tumult of battle, &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, seems indicated: a dense crowd and tumult, where one is close upon another; as also &#1504;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, signify not reciprocal destruction, slaughter, but to press firmly and closely upon one another, a dense crowd. - Fl.)<p>continued...</body></html>
