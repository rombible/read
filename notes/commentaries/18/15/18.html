But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour.

Men wise in the best sense, not to do evil, but to do good; not worldly wise men, but such who have wisdom, sound wisdom in the inward parts; who are wise to salvation, and who are partakers of divine and spiritual wisdom; and such men, as they would never tell an untruth, so they would never report a false or a foolish thing they had heard, nor any thing but upon a good testimony, what they have received from their fathers, who were also wise and good men; and therefore such a testimony, though not ocular, but by tradition, deserves regard: <p>and have not hid it; their fathers did not hide it from them, and what they have received from their fathers they did not hide it from their children; and so it came to be handed down from one to another with great truth, exactness, and certainty, and to be depended upon, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>.

Whether the words are his own or not, the sentiments, at any rate, Eliphaz declares to have come down to him from remote times. The "wise men" to whom he refers may have been men of the Beni Kedem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). who were noted for their wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>), or possibly Egyptians or Babylonians. Books containing moral aphorisms and instructions were certainly composed both in Egypt and in Babyhmia at a very ancient date (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 11-16; vol. 3. p. 135; vol. 7. pp. 119-122). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  Are the consolations of God too small for thee,<p>And a word thus tenderly spoken with thee?<p>12  What overpowers thy hearts?<p>And why do thine eyes wink,<p>13  That thou turnest thy snorting against God,<p>And sendest forth such words from thy mouth?<p>By the consolations of God, Eliphaz means the promises in accordance with the majesty and will of God, by which he and the other friends have sought to cheer him, of course presupposing a humble resignation to the just hand of God. By "a word (spoken) in gentleness to him," he means the gentle tone which they have maintained, while he has passionately opposed them. &#1500;&#1488;&#1496;, elsewhere &#1500;&#1488;&#1496; (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a>, of the softly murmuring and gently flowing Siloah), from &#1488;&#1496; (declined, &#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;), with the neutral, adverbial &#1500; (as &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1492;), signifies: with a soft step, gently, The word has no connection with &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, &#1500;&#1488;&#1496;, to cover over, and is not third praet.

Are these divine consolations, and these so gentle addresses, too small for thee (&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; &#1502;&#1502;&#1498;, opp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-7.htm">1 Kings 19:7</a>), i.e., beneath thy dignity, and unworthy of they notice?

Job ought to control this angry spirit, &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Psychol. S. 198); but he allows it to burst forth, and makes even God the object on which he vents his anger in impetuous language. How much better it would be for him, if he would search within himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-39.htm">Lamentations 3:39</a>) for the reason of those sufferings which so deprive him of his self-control! </body></html>
