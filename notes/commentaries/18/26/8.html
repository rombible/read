If we look about us, to the earth and waters here below, we see his almighty power. If we consider hell beneath, though out of our sight, yet we may conceive the discoveries of God's power there. If we look up to heaven above, we see displays of God's almighty power. By his Spirit, the eternal Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters, the breath of his mouth, Ps 33:6, he has not only made the heavens, but beautified them. By redemption, all the other wonderful works of the Lord are eclipsed; and we may draw near, and taste his grace, learn to love him, and walk with delight in his ways. The ground of the controversy between Job and the other disputants was, that they unjustly thought from his afflictions that he must have been guilty of heinous crimes. They appear not to have duly considered the evil and just desert of original sin; nor did they take into account the gracious designs of God in purifying his people. Job also darkened counsel by words without knowledge. But his views were more distinct. He does not appear to have alleged his personal righteousness as the ground of his hope towards God. Yet what he admitted in a general view of his case, he in effect denied, while he complained of his sufferings as unmerited and severe; that very complaint proving the necessity for their being sent, in order to his being further humbled in the sight of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds - That is, he seems to do it, or to collect the waters in the clouds, as in bottles or vessels. The clouds appear to hold the waters, as if bound up, until he is pleased to send them drop by drop upon the earth.<p>And the cloud is not rent under them - The wonder which Job here expresses is, that so large a quantity of water as is poured down from the clouds, should be held suspended in the air without seeming to rend the cloud, and falling all at once. His image is that of a bottle, or vessel, filled with water, suspended in the air, and which is not rent. What were the views which he had of the clouds, of course it is impossible now to say. If he regarded them as they are, as vapors, or if he considered them to be a more solid substance, capable of holding water, there was equal ground for wonder. In the former case, his amazement would have arisen from the fact, that so light, fragile, and evanescent a substance as vapor should contain so large a quantity of water; in the latter case, his wonder would have been that such a substance should distil its contents drop by drop. There is equal reason for admiring the wisdom of God in the production of rain, now that the cause is understood. The clouds are collections of vapors. They contain moisture, or vapor, which ascends from the earth, and which is held in suspension when in small particles in the clouds; as, when a room is swept, the small particles of dust will be seen to float in the room. When these small particles are attracted, and form masses as large as drops, the air will no longer sustain them, and they fall to the earth. Man never could have devised a way for causing rain; and the mode in which it is provided that large quantities of water shall be borne from one place to another in the air, and made to fall when it is needed, by which the vapors that ascend from the ocean shall not be suffered to fall again into the ocean, but shall be carried on to the land, is adapted to excite our admiration of the wisdom of God now, no less than it was in the time of Job. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. in &#8230; clouds&#8212;as if in airy vessels, which, though light, do not burst with the weight of water in them (Pr 30:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This also is a miraculous work of God, considering the nature of these waters, which are fluid and heavy, and pressing downward, especially being ofttimes there in great abundance; and withal, the quality of the clouds, which are thin and loose bodies of the same nature with fogs and mists upon the face of the earth, and therefore of themselves utterly unable to bear that weight, and to keep up those waters from falling suddenly and violently upon the earth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds,....

The wonder of the clouds, floating reservoirs of water, which do not burst under the weight of waters which they contain.

The metaphor is, no doubt, drawn from those water-skins, so well known in the East, and especially in Arabia, in which men stored the water for their journeys and other needs, which were liable to be "rent" by the weight of the liquid within them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Instead of the appellation &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, which reminds one of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>, - where a like peacemaking act of judgment on the part of God is promised in reference to the spirit-host of the heights that have been working seductively among the nations on earth, - &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;, of similar meaning to &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;, used elsewhere, occurs in this verse. The stars, according to biblical representation, are like an army arrayed for battle, but not as after the Persian representation - as an army divided into troops of the Ahuramazd and Angramainyus (Ahriman), but a standing army of the children of light, clad in the armour of light, under the guidance of the one God the Creator (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>, comp. the anti-dualistic assertion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>). The one God is the Lord among these numberless legions, who commands their reverence, and maintains unity among them; and over whom does not His light arise? Umbr. explains: who does not His light, which He communicates to the hosts of heaven, vanquish (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; in the usual warlike meaning: to rise against any one); but this is a thought that is devoid of purpose in this connection. &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493; with the emphatic suff. hu (as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-23.htm">Job 24:23</a>, &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;) at any rate refers directly to God: His light in distinction from the derived light of the hosts of heaven. This distinction is better brought out if we interpret (Merc., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm., and others): over whom does (would) not His light arise? i.e., all receive their light from His, and do but reflect it back. But &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495; cannot be justified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a>. Therefore we interpret with Ew. and Hlgst. thus: whom does not His light surpass, or, literally, over whom (i.e., which of these beings of light) does it not rise, leaving it behind and exceeding it in brightness (&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; as synon. of &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;)? How then could a mortal be just with God, i.e., at His side or standing up before Him; and how could one of woman born be spotless! How could he (which is hereby indirectly said) enter into a controversy with God, who is infinitely exalted above him, and maintain before Him a moral character faultless, and therefore absolutely free from condemnation! In the heights of heaven God's decision is revered; and should man, the feeble one, and born flesh of flesh (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1</a>), dare to contend with God? Behold, &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1497;&#1512;&#1495; (&#1506;&#1491;, as usually when preceded by a negation, adeo, ne ... quidem, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>, where J. H. Michaelis correctly renders: adeo up spinas perplexitate aequent, and &#1488;&#1500; used in the same way, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>, Ew. 219, c), even as to the moon, it does not (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; with Waw apod., Ges. 145, 2, although there is a reading &#1500;&#1488; without &#1493;) shine bright, &#1497;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  equals  &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;, from &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;  equals  &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;.<p>(Note: It is worthy of observation, that hila&#770;l signifies in Arabic the new moon (comp. Genesis, S. 307); and the Hiphil ahalla, like the Kal halla, is used of the appearing and shining of the new moon.)<p>Thus lxx, Targ. Jer., and Gecatilia translate; whereas Saadia translates: it turns not in (Arab. la&#770; ydchl), or properly, it does not pitch its tent, fix its habitation. But to pitch one's tent is &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; or &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;, whence &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>,  equals  &#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;; and what is still more decisive, one would naturally expect &#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; in connection with this thought. We therefore render &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; as a form for once boldly used in the scriptural language for &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm">Isaiah 28:28</a> &#1488;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; once occurs for &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;. Even the moon is only a feeble light before God, and the stars are not clean in His eyes; there is a vast distance between Him and His highest and most glorious creatures - how much more between Him and man, the worm of the dust!<p>The friends, as was to be expected, are unable to furnish any solution of the mystery, why the ungodly often live and die happily; and yet they ought to be able to give this solution, if the language which they employ against Job were authorized. Bildad alone speaks in the above speech, Zophar is silent. But Bildad does not utter a word that affects the question. This designed omission shows the inability of the friends to solve it, as much as the tenacity with which they firmly maintain their dogma; and the breach that has been made in it, either they will not perceive or yet not acknowledge, because they think that thereby they are approaching too near to the honour of God. Moreover, it must be observed with what delicate tact, and how directly to the purpose in the structure of the whole, this short speech of Bildad's closes the opposition of the friends. Two things are manifest from this last speech of the friends: First, that they know nothing new to bring forward against Job, and nothing just to Job's advantage; that all their darts bound back from Job; and that, though not according to their judgment, yet in reality, they are beaten. This is evident from the fact that Bildad is unable to give any answer to Job's questions, but can only take up the one idea in Job's speech, that he confidently and boldly thinks of being able to approach God's throne of judgment; he repeats with slight variation what Eliphaz has said twice already, concerning the infinite distance between man and God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17-21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14-16</a>, and is not even denied by Job himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>. But, secondly, the poet cannot allow us to part from the friends with too great repugnance; for they are Job's friends notwithstanding, and at the close we see them willingly obedient to God's instruction, to go to Job that he may pray for them and make sacrifice on their behalf. For this reason he does not make Bildad at last repeat those unjust incriminations which were put prominently forward in the speech of Eliphaz, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-11</a>. Bildad only reminds Job of the universal sinfulness of the human race once again, without direct accusation, in order that Job may himself derive from it the admonition to humble himself; and this admonition Job really needs, for his speeches are in many ways contrary to that humility which is still the duty of sinful man, even in connection with the best justified consciousness of right thoughts and actions towards the holy God. <p> 1  Then Job began, and said:<p> 2  How has thou helped him that is without power,<p>Raised the arm that hath no strength!<p>  3  How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom,<p>And fully declared the essence of the matter!<p>  4  To whom hast thou uttered words,<p>And whose breath proceeded from thee?<p>Bildad is the person addressed, and the exclamations in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a> are ironical: how thy speech contains nothing whatever that might help me, the supposedly feeble one, in conquering my affliction and my temptation; me, the supposedly ignorant one, in comprehending man's mysterious lot, and mine! &#1500;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1495;, according to the idea, is only equivalent to &#1499;&#1495; &#1500;&#1493; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;) &#1500;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;, and &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; equivalent to &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506; &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; (&#1500;&#1488; &#1506;&#1494; &#1500;&#1493;); the former is the abstr. pro concreto, the latter the genitival connection - the arm of the no-power, i.e., powerless (Ges. 152, 1). The powerless one is Job himself, not God (Merc., Schlottm.), as even the choice of the verbs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>, shows. Respecting &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which we have translated essentiality, duration, completion, we said, on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>, that it is formed from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-21.htm">Proverbs 8:21</a>), not directly indeed, but by means of a verb &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; brev a fo  (&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;), in the signification subsistere (comp. Arab. ka&#770;n, and Syriac &#1511;&#1493;&#1501;);<p>(Note: Comp. also Spiegel, Grammatik der Huzvresch-Sprache, S. 103.)<p>it is a Hophal-formation (like &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492;), and signifies, so to speak, durability, subsistentia, substantia, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, so that the comparison of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. 'ss (whence &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. as&#305;&#770;s, asa&#770;s, etc., fundamentum) is forced upon one, and the relationship to the Sanskrit as (asmi  equals  &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#768;) can remain undecided.
