All the secrets of this mysterious, invisible, and undiscoverable world are naked and open before Him—the grave lies naked and destruction is uncovered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-5.htm" title="Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.">Job 26:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Dead things, </span>&c. — That is, according to several interpreters, those seeds which are sown and die in the earth quicken again and grow. Or, as R. Levi rather thinks, an allusion is made to those <span class="ital">vegetables, stones, </span>or <span class="ital">metals, </span>which are found in the earth under the waters. The Hebrew word here for dead things is <span class="greekheb">רפאים</span>, <span class="ital">rephaim, </span>which is generally rendered <span class="ital">dead men; </span>thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm" title="Will you show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise you? Selah.">Psalm 88:10</a>, we read, Wilt thou show wonders to <span class="ital">methim, the dead? </span>Shall <span class="ital">rephaim, the dead, </span>arise and praise thee? <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm" title="They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.">Isaiah 26:14</a>. <span class="ital">The dead, methim, </span>shall not live: <span class="ital">the deceased, rephaim, </span>shall not rise. In these passages, therefore, and many others that might be produced, <span class="ital">methim </span>and <span class="ital">rephaim </span>are both translated <span class="ital">dead </span>or <span class="ital">deceased. </span>Instead of this, however, the LXX., the Vulgate Latin, and the Targum, render <span class="ital">rephaim, giants, </span>or <span class="ital">mighty men. </span>“Their interpretation is very just,” says Chappelow, “if, as R. Bechai writes, they were so named because their countenance was so austere, that whoever looked on them, <span class="ital">manus ejus remissæ fuerunt, his hands were weakened </span>with the terror that was upon him, (Buxtorf in <span class="ital">rapha.</span>) From hence it is that our learned Mede explains <span class="ital">rephaim, </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-16.htm" title="The man that wanders out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.">Proverbs 21:16</a>, not of the <span class="ital">dead, </span>but of the <span class="ital">giants </span>or <span class="ital">rebels </span>against God, of whom we read, Genesis 6., namely, those mighty men of the old world, whose wickedness was so great as to occasion the deluge. Therefore, to ‘remain in the congregation of <span class="ital">rephaim,’ </span>is the same as to go and keep them company; that is, to go to that accursed place and condition in which they are. Thus, S. Jarchi’s gloss is, <span class="ital">In cœtu rephaim, </span>that is, <span class="ital">in cœtu gehinnom, the congregation of those in hell. </span>His gloss is the very same on our text here in Job. Again, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/9-17.htm" title="Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant....">Proverbs 9:17-18</a>, ‘He knoweth not that <span class="ital">rephaim, the dead, </span>(the mighty ones,) are there, and that her (the harlot’s) guests are in the depths <span class="ital">of hell,’ </span>that is, she will bring them, who frequent her, to hell, to keep the apostate giants company. From all which we conclude, with the ingenious author above mentioned, that the place before us, and the verse following, seem to be no other than a description of hell.” Peters, Dodd, and many other critics, view the passage in the same light. Houbigant renders it, <span class="ital">Behold the giants tremble beneath the waters in their habitations; </span>and, he says, “Job means those giants who were overwhelmed with the flood; having their overthrow as immediately present before his eyes, because the deluge at this time was fresh in the memory of men.” Poole, whose note on the passage is well worth the reader’s attention, comprehends all the forementioned particulars in his interpretation, thus: Job, having censured Bildad’s discourse, proceeds to show how little he needed his information in that point. He shows that the power and providence of God reach not only to the things we see, but also to the invisible parts of the world; not only to the heavens above and their inhabitants, and to men upon earth, of which Bildad discoursed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/25-2.htm" title="Dominion and fear are with him, he makes peace in his high places....">Job 25:2-3</a>, but also to such persons or things as are under the earth, or under the waters; which are out of our sight and reach, yet not out of the view of Divine Providence: including, 1st, <span class="ital">dead </span>or <span class="ital">lifeless things, </span>such as amber, pearl, coral, metals, or other minerals, which <span class="ital">are formed </span>or <span class="ital">brought forth, </span>by the almighty power of God, <span class="ital">from under the waters; </span>either in the bottom of the sea, or within the earth, which is the lowest element, and in the Scripture and other authors spoken of as under the waters. And, 2d, <span class="ital">dead men, </span>and the worst of them, such as died in their sins, and after death were condemned to further miseries; of whom this very word seems to be used, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm" title="For her house inclines to death, and her paths to the dead.">Proverbs 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm" title="But he knows not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.">Proverbs 9:18</a>,) who are here said to <span class="ital">mourn </span>or <span class="ital">groan from under the waters, </span>from the lower parts of the earth; or from under those subterranean waters which are supposed to be within and under the earth; <span class="ital">and </span>from under <span class="ital">the inhabitants thereof; </span>either of the waters or of the earth, under which these waters are; or <span class="ital">with the </span>other <span class="ital">inhabitants thereof; </span>of that place under the waters; namely, the apostate spirits. So the sense is, that God’s dominion is over all men, yea, even the dead, and the worst of them, who, though they would not own God, nor his providence, while they lived, yet now are forced to acknowledge and feel that power which they despised, and bitterly mourn under the sad effects of it in their infernal habitations.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:5-14 Many striking instances are here given of the wisdom and power of God, in the creation and preservation of the world. If we look about us, to the earth and waters here below, we see his almighty power. If we consider hell beneath, though out of our sight, yet we may conceive the discoveries of God's power there. If we look up to heaven above, we see displays of God's almighty power. By his Spirit, the eternal Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters, the breath of his mouth, Ps 33:6, he has not only made the heavens, but beautified them. By redemption, all the other wonderful works of the Lord are eclipsed; and we may draw near, and taste his grace, learn to love him, and walk with delight in his ways. The ground of the controversy between Job and the other disputants was, that they unjustly thought from his afflictions that he must have been guilty of heinous crimes. They appear not to have duly considered the evil and just desert of original sin; nor did they take into account the gracious designs of God in purifying his people. Job also darkened counsel by words without knowledge. But his views were more distinct. He does not appear to have alleged his personal righteousness as the ground of his hope towards God. Yet what he admitted in a general view of his case, he in effect denied, while he complained of his sufferings as unmerited and severe; that very complaint proving the necessity for their being sent, in order to his being further humbled in the sight of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dead things - Job here commences his description of God, to show that his views of his majesty and glory were in no way inferior to those which had been expressed by Bildad, and that what Bildad had said conveyed to him no real information. In this description he far surpasses Bildad in loftiness of conception, and sublimity of description. Indeed, it may be doubted whether for grandeur this passage is surpassed by any description of the majesty of God in the Bible. The passage here has given rise to much discussion, and to a great variety of opinion. Our common translation is most feeble, and by no means conveys its true force. The object of the whole passage is to assert the universal dominion of God. Bildad had said <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/25-1.htm">Job 25:1-6</a> that the dominion of God extended to the heavens, and to the armies of the skies; that God surpassed in majesty the splendor of the heavenly bodies; and that compared with him man was a worm. Job commences his description by saying that the dominion of God extended even to the nether world; and that such were his majesty and power that even the shades of the mighty dead trembled at his presence, and that hell was all naked before him. The word &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;  ra&#770;pha&#770;'&#305;&#770;ym - Rephaim - so feebly rendered "dead things," means the shades of the dead; the departed spirits that dwell in Sheol; see the word explained at length in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>. They are those who have left this world and who have gone down to dwell in the world beneath - the great and mighty conquerors and kings; the illustrious dead of past times, who have left the world and are congregated in the land of Shades. Jerome renders it, "gigantes," and the Septuagint, &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  gigantes - giants; from a common belief that those shades were larger than life. Thus, Lucretius says:<p>Quippe et enim jam tum divum mortalia secla<p>Egregias animo facies vigilante videbant;<p>Et magis in somnis, mirando corporis aucter<p>Rer. Nat. ver. 1168.<p>The word "shades" here will express the sense, meaning the departed spirits that are assembled in Sheol. The Chaldee renders it, &#1490;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; - mighty ones, or giants; the Syriac, in like manner, giants.<p>Are formed - The Syriac renders this, are killed. Jerome, gemunt - groan; Septuagint, "Are giants born from beneath the water, and the neighboring places?" What idea the authors of that version attached to the passage it is difficult to say. The Hebrew word used here (&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;  yecho&#770;la&#772;lu&#770;, from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  chu&#770;l), means to twist, to turn, to be in anguish - as in child birth; and then it may mean to tremble, quake, be in terror; and the idea here seems to be, that the shades of the dead were in anguish, or trembled at the awful presence, and under the dominion of God. So Luther renders it - understanding it of giants - Die Riesen angsten sich unter den Wassern. The sense would be well expressed, "The shades of the dead tremble, or are in anguish before him. They fear his power. They acknowledge his empire."<p>Under the waters - The abode of departed spirits is always in this book placed beneath the ground. But why this abode is placed beneath the waters, is not apparent. It is usually under the ground, and the entrance to it is by the grave, or by some dark cavern; compare Virgil's Aeniad, Lib. vi. A different interpretation has been proposed of this verse, which seems better to suit the connection. It is to understand the phrase (&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;  tachath) "under," as meaning simply beneath - "the shades beneath;" and to regard the word (&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  may&#305;&#770;m) waters as connected with the following member:<p>"The shades beneath tremble;<p>The waters and the inhabitants thereof."<p>Thus explained, the passage means that the whole universe is under the control of God, and trembles before him. Sheol and its Shades; the oceans and their inhabitants stand in awe before him.<p>And the inhabitants thereof - Of the waters - the oceans. The idea is, that the vast inhabitants of the deep all recognize the power of God and tremble before him. This description accords with that given by the ancient poets of the power and majesty of the gods, and is not less sublime than any given by them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-14. As before in the ninth and twelfth chapters, Job had shown himself not inferior to the friends' inability to describe God's greatness, so now he describes it as manifested in hell (the world of the dead), Job 26:5, 6; on earth, Job 26:7; in the sky, Job 26:8-11; the sea, Job 26:12; the heavens, Job 26:13.<p>Dead things are formed&#8212;Rather, "The souls of the dead (Rephaim) tremble." Not only does God's power exist, as Bildad says (Job 25:2), "in high places" (heaven), but reaches to the region of the dead. Rephaim here, and in Pr 21:16 and Isa 14:9, is from a Hebrew root, meaning "to be weak," hence "deceased"; in Ge 14:5 it is applied to the Canaanite giants; perhaps in derision, to express their weakness, in spite of their gigantic size, as compared with Jehovah [Umbreit]; or, as the imagination of the living magnifies apparitions, the term originally was applied to ghosts, and then to giants in general [Magee].<p>from under&#8212;Umbreit joins this with the previous word "tremble from beneath" (so Isa 14:9). But the Masoretic text joins it to "under the waters." Thus the place of the dead will be represented as "under the waters" (Ps 18:4, 5); and the waters as under the earth (Ps 24:2). Magee well translates thus: "The souls of the dead tremble; (the places) under the waters, and their inhabitants." Thus the Masoretic connection is retained; and at the same time the parallel clauses are evenly balanced. "The inhabitants of the places under the waters" are those in Gehenna, the lower of the two parts into which Sheol, according to the Jews, is divided; they answer to "destruction," that is, the place of the wicked in Job 26:6, as "Rephaim" (Job 26:5) to "Hell" (Sheol) (Job 26:6). "Sheol" comes from a Hebrew root&#8212;"ask," because it is insatiable (Pr 27:20); or "ask as a loan to be returned," implying Sheol is but a temporary abode, previous to the resurrection; so for English Version "formed," the Septuagint and Chaldee translate; shall be born, or born again, implying the dead are to be given back from Sheol and born again into a new state [Magee].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Job having censured Bildad’s discourse concerning God’s dominion and power, as insignificant and impertinent to their question, he here proceedeth to show how little he needed his information in that point, and that he was able to instruct him in that doctrine, of which accordingly he gives divers proofs or instances. Here he showeth that the power and providence of God reacheth not only to the things which we see, but also to the invisible parts of the world; not only to the heavens above, and their inhabitants, and to men upon earth, of which Bildad discoursed <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-2.htm" title="Dominion and fear are with him, he makes peace in his high places.">Job 25:2</a>,3</span>, but also to such persons or things as are under the earth, or under the waters, which are under the earth; which are out of our sight and reach, and might be thought to be out of the ken or care of Divine Providence. This Hebrew word sometimes signifies giants, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm" title="Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.">Deu 2:11</a>,20 3:13 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-8.htm" title="These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.">1 Chronicles 20:8</a></span>; whence it may be translated to other great and, as it were, gigantic creatures, and more commonly <span class="ital">dead men</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm" title="Shall your loving kindness be declared in the grave? or your faithfulness in destruction?">Psalm 88:11</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm" title="For her house inclines to death, and her paths to the dead.">Proverbs 2:18</a> 9:18 21:16 <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm" title="Hell from beneath is moved for you to meet you at your coming: it stirs up the dead for you, even all the chief ones of the earth; it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.">Isaiah 14:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm" title="They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.">Isaiah 26:14</a>,19</span> whence it is supposed metaphorically to signify also <span class="ital">dead</span> or <span class="ital">lifeless</span> things; though there be no example of that use of the word elsewhere; and it may seem improper to call those things dead, which never had nor were capable of life. The next Hebrew word, or the verb, is primarily used of women with child, and signifies their <span class="ital">bringing forth</span> their young ones <span class="ital">with travail or grievous pains</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-3.htm" title="They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.">Job 39:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-9.htm" title="The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests: and in his temple does every one speak of his glory.">Psalm 29:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-4.htm" title="Be you ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.">Isaiah 23:4</a> 45:10</span>; and thence it signifies either to <span class="ital">form</span> or <span class="ital">bring forth</span>, as below, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-13.htm" title="By his spirit he has garnished the heavens; his hand has formed the crooked serpent.">Job 26:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-10.htm" title="The great God that formed all things both rewards the fool, and rewards transgressors.">Proverbs 26:10</a></span>; or to <span class="ital">grieve</span> or <span class="ital">mourn</span>, or <span class="ital">to be in pain</span>.

Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4.

So the sense is, that God’s dominion is over all men, yea, even the dead, and the worst of them, who though they would not own God nor his providence whilst they lived, yet now are forced to acknowledge and feel that power which they despised, and bitterly mourn under the sad effects of it in their subterranean and infernal habitations, of which the next verse speaks more plainly. And this sense seems to be favoured by the context and scope of the place, wherein Job begins his discourse of God’s power and providence at the lowermost and hidden parts of the world, and thence proceeds to those parts which are higher and visible. Nor is it strange that Job speaks of these matters, seeing it is evident that Job, and others of the holy patriarchs and prophets of old, did know and believe the doctrine of the future life, and of its several recompences to good and bad men.

It is difficult to say what things are here meant; it may be understood of "lifeless" things, as Mr. Broughton renders it; things that never had any life, things inanimate, that never had at least an animal life, though they may have a vegetable one; and so may be interpreted of grains of corn, and which indeed die before they are quickened; to which both Christ and the apostle allude, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>; and which, as they cannot grow without water, and their fructification and increase are owing to the earth being plentifully watered with rain, may be said to be formed under the waters; and of these Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom interpret the words; and the latter also makes mention of herbs, plants, and trees in the sea, particularly almug trees, as being probably intended; to which may be added, corals, and other sea plants, formed from under the waters; yea, some make mention of woods and forests there: but the last mentioned writer, seems inclined to think that metals and minerals may be intended; and it is well known that much of gold is taken out of rivers, as also pearls and precious stones; and that iron is taken out of the earth, and brass molten out of stone; and that the several metals and minerals are dug out of mountains and hills, from whence fountains and rivers flow; but as the word used has the signification of something gigantic, it has inclined others to think of sea monsters, as of the great whales which God made in the seas, and the leviathan he has made to play therein: <p>and or "with" <p>the inhabitants thereof; the innumerable company of fishes, both of the larger and lesser sort, which are all formed in and under the waters: but why may not giants themselves be designed, since the word is sometimes used of them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>; and so the Vulgate Latin and the Septuagint version here render the word, and may refer to the giants that were before the flood, and who were the causes of filling the world with rapine and violence, and so of bringing the flood of waters upon it; in which they perished "with the inhabitants thereof"; or their neighbours; of whom see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>; and the spirits of these being in prison, in hell, as the Apostle Peter says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>; which is commonly supposed to be under the earth, and so under the waters, in which they perished; they may be represented as in pain and torment, and groaning and trembling under the same, as the word here used is by some thought to signify, and is so rendered (t); though as the word "Rephaim" is often used of dead men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10</a>; it may be understood of them here, and have respect to the formation of them anew, or their resurrection from the dead, when the earth shall cast them forth; and especially of those whose graves are in the sea, and who have been buried in the waters of it, when that shall deliver up the dead that are therein, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>; which will be a wonderful instance of the mighty power of God. The Targumist seems to have a notion of this, or at least refers unto it, paraphrasing the words thus, <p>"is it possible that the mighty men (or giants) should be created (that is, recreated or regenerated; that is, raised from the dead); seeing they are under the waters, and their armies?'' <p>(t) "gemunt", V.

This abode of deceased persons lies deep down under the waters of the sea and all the inhabitants of these waters, for the sea belongs to the upper world. Yet the power of God is felt even at this immeasurable distance from His abode on high. Bildad had referred to the power of God as “making peace” on high; Job points to what is a more wonderful illustration of His power, it pervades the underworld, and the dead tremble under its influence. Whether the statement is general, or whether perhaps there may not be allusion to great convulsions in nature, shaking the earth, and rousing up out of their lethargy even the drowsy, nerveless, shades with terror, may be doubtful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5–13</span>. That Job has no need to be instructed regarding the greatness of God he now shews, by entering upon an exhibition of its operations in every sphere of that which exists, Hades, the Earth and Heaven, in which he far outstrips the feeble effort of Bildad.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-14.</span> - Job now turns from controversy to the realities of the case, and begins with a full acknowledgment of God's greatness, might, and inscrutableness. As Bildad seemed to have supposed that he needed enlightenment on these points (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2-4</a>), Job may have thought it right to make once more a plain profession of his belief (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9-25</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dead things are formed from under the waters</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the dead from under the waters tremble.</span> Hehraists generally are agreed that one of the meanings of Rephaim (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) is "the dead" or the departed, considered especially as inhabitants of Hades (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>). And if so, this meaning is certainly appropriate here. Blidad had illustrated God's dominion from his power in heaven. Job shows that it exists alike in heaven and earth (vers. 7-13), and in the region under the earth (vers. 5, 6). There, in Sheol, under the waters of the ocean, the dead tremble at the thought of the Most High; they tremble together with other inhabitants thereof, as evil spirits, rebel intelligences, east down to Hades, and there held in durance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Instead of the appellation &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, which reminds one of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>, - where a like peacemaking act of judgment on the part of God is promised in reference to the spirit-host of the heights that have been working seductively among the nations on earth, - &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;, of similar meaning to &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;, used elsewhere, occurs in this verse. The stars, according to biblical representation, are like an army arrayed for battle, but not as after the Persian representation - as an army divided into troops of the Ahuramazd and Angramainyus (Ahriman), but a standing army of the children of light, clad in the armour of light, under the guidance of the one God the Creator (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>, comp. the anti-dualistic assertion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>). The one God is the Lord among these numberless legions, who commands their reverence, and maintains unity among them; and over whom does not His light arise? Umbr. explains: who does not His light, which He communicates to the hosts of heaven, vanquish (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; in the usual warlike meaning: to rise against any one); but this is a thought that is devoid of purpose in this connection. &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493; with the emphatic suff. hu (as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-23.htm">Job 24:23</a>, &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;) at any rate refers directly to God: His light in distinction from the derived light of the hosts of heaven. This distinction is better brought out if we interpret (Merc., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm., and others): over whom does (would) not His light arise? i.e., all receive their light from His, and do but reflect it back. But &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495; cannot be justified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a>. Therefore we interpret with Ew. and Hlgst. thus: whom does not His light surpass, or, literally, over whom (i.e., which of these beings of light) does it not rise, leaving it behind and exceeding it in brightness (&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; as synon. of &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;)? How then could a mortal be just with God, i.e., at His side or standing up before Him; and how could one of woman born be spotless! How could he (which is hereby indirectly said) enter into a controversy with God, who is infinitely exalted above him, and maintain before Him a moral character faultless, and therefore absolutely free from condemnation! In the heights of heaven God's decision is revered; and should man, the feeble one, and born flesh of flesh (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1</a>), dare to contend with God? Behold, &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1497;&#1512;&#1495; (&#1506;&#1491;, as usually when preceded by a negation, adeo, ne ... quidem, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>, where J. H. Michaelis correctly renders: adeo up spinas perplexitate aequent, and &#1488;&#1500; used in the same way, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>, Ew. 219, c), even as to the moon, it does not (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; with Waw apod., Ges. 145, 2, although there is a reading &#1500;&#1488; without &#1493;) shine bright, &#1497;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  equals  &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;, from &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;  equals  &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;.<p>(Note: It is worthy of observation, that hila&#770;l signifies in Arabic the new moon (comp. Genesis, S. 307); and the Hiphil ahalla, like the Kal halla, is used of the appearing and shining of the new moon.)<p>Thus lxx, Targ. Jer., and Gecatilia translate; whereas Saadia translates: it turns not in (Arab. la&#770; ydchl), or properly, it does not pitch its tent, fix its habitation. But to pitch one's tent is &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; or &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;, whence &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>,  equals  &#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;; and what is still more decisive, one would naturally expect &#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; in connection with this thought. We therefore render &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; as a form for once boldly used in the scriptural language for &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm">Isaiah 28:28</a> &#1488;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; once occurs for &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;. Even the moon is only a feeble light before God, and the stars are not clean in His eyes; there is a vast distance between Him and His highest and most glorious creatures - how much more between Him and man, the worm of the dust!<p>The friends, as was to be expected, are unable to furnish any solution of the mystery, why the ungodly often live and die happily; and yet they ought to be able to give this solution, if the language which they employ against Job were authorized. Bildad alone speaks in the above speech, Zophar is silent. But Bildad does not utter a word that affects the question. This designed omission shows the inability of the friends to solve it, as much as the tenacity with which they firmly maintain their dogma; and the breach that has been made in it, either they will not perceive or yet not acknowledge, because they think that thereby they are approaching too near to the honour of God. Moreover, it must be observed with what delicate tact, and how directly to the purpose in the structure of the whole, this short speech of Bildad's closes the opposition of the friends. Two things are manifest from this last speech of the friends: First, that they know nothing new to bring forward against Job, and nothing just to Job's advantage; that all their darts bound back from Job; and that, though not according to their judgment, yet in reality, they are beaten. This is evident from the fact that Bildad is unable to give any answer to Job's questions, but can only take up the one idea in Job's speech, that he confidently and boldly thinks of being able to approach God's throne of judgment; he repeats with slight variation what Eliphaz has said twice already, concerning the infinite distance between man and God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17-21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14-16</a>, and is not even denied by Job himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>. But, secondly, the poet cannot allow us to part from the friends with too great repugnance; for they are Job's friends notwithstanding, and at the close we see them willingly obedient to God's instruction, to go to Job that he may pray for them and make sacrifice on their behalf. For this reason he does not make Bildad at last repeat those unjust incriminations which were put prominently forward in the speech of Eliphaz, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-11</a>. Bildad only reminds Job of the universal sinfulness of the human race once again, without direct accusation, in order that Job may himself derive from it the admonition to humble himself; and this admonition Job really needs, for his speeches are in many ways contrary to that humility which is still the duty of sinful man, even in connection with the best justified consciousness of right thoughts and actions towards the holy God. <p> 1  Then Job began, and said:<p> 2  How has thou helped him that is without power,<p>Raised the arm that hath no strength!<p>  3  How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom,<p>And fully declared the essence of the matter!<p>  4  To whom hast thou uttered words,<p>And whose breath proceeded from thee?<p>Bildad is the person addressed, and the exclamations in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a> are ironical: how thy speech contains nothing whatever that might help me, the supposedly feeble one, in conquering my affliction and my temptation; me, the supposedly ignorant one, in comprehending man's mysterious lot, and mine! &#1500;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1495;, according to the idea, is only equivalent to &#1499;&#1495; &#1500;&#1493; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;) &#1500;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;, and &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; equivalent to &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506; &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; (&#1500;&#1488; &#1506;&#1494; &#1500;&#1493;); the former is the abstr. pro concreto, the latter the genitival connection - the arm of the no-power, i.e., powerless (Ges. 152, 1). The powerless one is Job himself, not God (Merc., Schlottm.), as even the choice of the verbs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>, shows. Respecting &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which we have translated essentiality, duration, completion, we said, on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>, that it is formed from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-21.htm">Proverbs 8:21</a>), not directly indeed, but by means of a verb &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; brev a fo  (&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;), in the signification subsistere (comp. Arab. ka&#770;n, and Syriac &#1511;&#1493;&#1501;);<p>(Note: Comp. also Spiegel, Grammatik der Huzvresch-Sprache, S. 103.)<p>it is a Hophal-formation (like &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492;), and signifies, so to speak, durability, subsistentia, substantia, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, so that the comparison of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. 'ss (whence &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. as&#305;&#770;s, asa&#770;s, etc., fundamentum) is forced upon one, and the relationship to the Sanskrit as (asmi  equals  &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#768;) can remain undecided.
