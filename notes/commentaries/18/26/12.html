The Hebrew word translated <span class="ital">divide, </span>is not the same that is used, Exodus 14., of the Red sea, but signifies a violent <span class="ital">breaking </span>and <span class="ital">tossing </span>of the waves as in a storm. And if the former part of the sentence means that God sometimes, by his power, raises a violent storm at sea, the latter may well enough be understood of the pride and swelling of the sea itself, allayed again by the same divine power and will which raised it.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:5-14 Many striking instances are here given of the wisdom and power of God, in the creation and preservation of the world. If we look about us, to the earth and waters here below, we see his almighty power. If we consider hell beneath, though out of our sight, yet we may conceive the discoveries of God's power there. If we look up to heaven above, we see displays of God's almighty power. By his Spirit, the eternal Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters, the breath of his mouth, Ps 33:6, he has not only made the heavens, but beautified them. By redemption, all the other wonderful works of the Lord are eclipsed; and we may draw near, and taste his grace, learn to love him, and walk with delight in his ways. The ground of the controversy between Job and the other disputants was, that they unjustly thought from his afflictions that he must have been guilty of heinous crimes. They appear not to have duly considered the evil and just desert of original sin; nor did they take into account the gracious designs of God in purifying his people. Job also darkened counsel by words without knowledge. But his views were more distinct. He does not appear to have alleged his personal righteousness as the ground of his hope towards God. Yet what he admitted in a general view of his case, he in effect denied, while he complained of his sufferings as unmerited and severe; that very complaint proving the necessity for their being sent, in order to his being further humbled in the sight of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He divideth the sea with His power - Herder renders this:<p>By his power he scourgeth the sea,<p>By his wisdom he bindeth its pride.<p>Jerome (Vulgate), "By his power the seas are suddenly congregated together The Septuagint, "By his power - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  katepause te&#772;n thalassan - he makes the sea calm." Luther, Vor seiner Kraft wird das Meer plotzlich ungestum - "By his power the sea becomes suddenly tempestuous." Noyes renders it, "By his power he stilleth the sea." This is undoubtedly the true meaning. There is no allusion here to the dividing of the sea when the Israelites left Egypt; but the ideals, that God has power to calm the tempest, and hush the waves into peace. The word used here (&#1512;&#1490;&#1506;  ra&#770;ga&#8219;) means, to make afraid, to terrify; especially, to restrain by threats; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-15.htm">Isaiah 51:15</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>.

The ocean is represented as enraged, and as lifted up with pride and rebellion.

As at the first creation, when the waters were caused to go off the face of the earth, and were separated from it; and the one was called earth, and the other seas, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>; or it may respect the division of those waters into divers seas and channels in the several parts of the world, for the better accommodation of the inhabitants of it, in respect of trade and commerce, and the more convenient supply of them with the various produce of different countries, and the transmitting of it to them: some have thought this has respect to the division of the Red sea for the children of Israel to walk in as on dry land, when pursued by the Egyptians, supposed to be meant by "Rahab" in the next clause; rather it may design the parting of the waves of the sea by a stormy wind, raised by the power of God, which lifts up the waves on high, and divides them in the sea, and dashes them one against another; wrinkles and furrows them, as Jarchi interprets the words, which is such an instance of the power and majesty or God, that he is sometimes described by it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-15.htm">Isaiah 51:15</a>; though the word used is sometimes taken in a quite different sense, for the stilling of the waves of the sea, and so it is by some rendered here, "he stilleth the sea by his power" (b); the noise of its waves, and makes them quiet, and the sea a calm, which has been exceeding boisterous and tempestuous, and is taken notice of as an effect of his sovereign and uncontrollable power, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>; and may be observed as a proof of our Lord's divinity, whom the winds and sea obeyed, to the astonishment of the mariners, who were convinced thereby that he must be some wonderful and extraordinary person, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>; <p>and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud; the proud waves of the sea, and humbles them, and makes them still, as before; or the proud monstrous creatures in it, as whales and others, particularly the leviathan, the king over all the children of pride, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-34.htm">Job 41:34</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>. The word used is "Rahab", one of the names of Egypt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>; and so Jarchi interprets it of the Egyptians, who were smitten of God with various plagues, and particularly in their firstborn; and at last at the Red sea, where multitudes perished, and Pharaoh their proud king, with his army; who was an emblem of the devil, whose sin, the cause of his fall and ruin, was pride; and the picture of proud and haughty sinners, whose destruction sooner or later is from the Lord; and which is an instance of his wisdom and understanding, who humbles the proud, and exalts the lowly. <p>(b)  "pacavit mare", Bolducius; "quiescit mare ipsum", Vatablus; so Sept. and Ben Gersom. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12, 13</span>.

The word means “to terrify,” and the parallelism of the second clause “smiteth through Rahab,” which refers to the subduing of a raging monster, suggests that the sea when “terrified” or rebuked is in a state of fury, and is quelled by the power of God. So already the Sept. κατέπαυσεν. This sense is also more suitable to the words “by his power.” On Rahab see notes, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-13.htm" title="If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.">Job 9:13</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He divideth the sea with his power</span>. "Divideth" is certainly a wrong translation. The verb used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) means either "stirreth up" or "stilleth." In favour of the former rendering are Rosen-muller, Schultens, Delitzsch, Merx, and Canon Cook; in favour of the latter, the LXX., Dillmann, and Dr. Stanley Leathes. In either case the general sentiment is that God has full mastery over the sea, and can regulate its movements at his pleasure. <span class="cmt_word">And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">smiteth through Rahab.</span> (On Rahab, as the great power of evil, see the comment on Job 9:13.) God is said to have "smitten him through <span class="accented">by his understanding</span>" since in the contest between good and evil it is rather intelligence than mere force that carries the day.
