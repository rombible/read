He is most large upon this head, because in this matter he was particularly accused. He was tender of all, and hurtful to none. Notice the principles by which Job was restrained from being uncharitable and unmerciful. He stood in awe of the Lord, as certainly against him, if he should wrong the poor. Regard to worldly interests may restrain a man from actual crimes; but the grace of God alone can make him hate, dread, and shun sinful thoughts and desires.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless - That is, if I have taken advantage of my rank, influence, and power, to oppress and injure him.<p>When I saw my help in the gate - The gate of a city was a place of concourse; a place where debates were held, and where justice was administered. Job speaks here of that part of his life when he was clothed with authority as a magistrate, or when he had power and influence as a public man. He says that he had never abused this power to oppress the fatherless. He had never taken advantage of his influence to injure them, because he saw he had a strong party under his control, or because he had power enough to carry his point, or because he had those under him who would sustain him in an oppressive measure. This is spoken with reference to the usually feeble and defenseless condition of the orphan, as one who is deprived of his natural protector and who is, therefore, liable to be wronged by those in power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. when&#8212;that is, "because."<p>I saw&#8212;that I might calculate on the "help" of a powerful party in the court of justice&#8212;("gate"), if I should be summoned by the injured fatherless.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To smite him with the fist of wickedness, as the phrase is, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-4.htm" title="Behold, you fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: you shall not fast as you do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.">Isaiah 58:4</a></span>; to bring him to the judgment-seat, that under colour of justice I might take away his right, as powerful oppressors use to do, or any ways to threaten, injure, or crush him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When I saw my help in the gate; </span> when I understood my advantage against him, and that I could influence the judges to do what I pleased. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,.... Either in a menacing way, threatening what he would do to them; which, from a man of wealth and authority, a civil magistrate, a judge, is very terrible to the poor and fatherless; or in order to strike him, which would be to smite with the fist of wickedness; or give a signal to others, by lifting up the hand to smite, as Ananias gave orders to smite the Apostle Paul; or thereby to give his vote against the fatherless wrongly, suffrages being sometimes made by lifting up the hands; or hereby Job signifies, that he was so far from doing the fatherless any real injury, that he had not so much as lifted up his hand, and even a finger against him: <p>when I saw my help in the gate; in the court of judicature held in the gate of the city, as was usual; though he knew he had the bench of judges for him, or they would give sentence in his behalf, and against the fatherless, if he did but hold up his hand, or lift up a finger to them, so ready would they be take his part and be on his side; yet he never made use of his power and interest to their detriment, or took such an advantage against them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If I have lifted <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:</span><p>(o) To oppress him and to do him harm.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">if I have lift up my hand</span>] i. e. to strike him down.

On the other hand, it has been observed (also Norzi) that it ought to be &#1492;&#1488;&#1505;&#1495;&#1491; according to this meaning; but it was not absolutely necessary, vid., Ges. 111, 2, b. &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; also would not be unsuitable in this combination; it would, as e.g., in &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, not affirm identity of number, but of character. But &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; is far more significant, and as the final word of the strophe more expressive, when referred to God. The form &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is to be judged of just like &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>; either they are forms of an exceptionally transitive (as &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/85-5.htm">Psalm 85:5</a>, and in &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;) use of the Kal of these verbs (vid., e.g., Parchon and Kimchi), or they are syncopated forms of the Pilel for &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1504;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, syncopated on account of the same letters coming together, especially in &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1504;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493; (Ew. 81, a, and most others); but this coincidence is sought elsewhere (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>), and not avoided in this manner (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-73.htm">Psalm 119:73</a>). Beside this syncope &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; might also be expected, while according to express testimony the first Nun is raphatum: we therefore prefer to derive these forms from Kal, without regarding them, with Olsh., as errors in writing. The suff. is rightly taken by lxx, Targ., Abulwalid, and almost all expositors,<p>(Note: Also in the Jerusalem Talmud, where R. Johanan, eating nothing which he did not also share with his slave, refers to these words of Job. Comp. also the story from the Midrash in Guiseppe Levi's Parabeln Legenden und Ged. aus Thalmud und Midrasch, S. 141 (Germ. transl. 1863): The wife of R. Jose began a dispute with her maid. Her husband came up and asked the cause, and when he saw that his wife was in the wrong, told her so in the presence of the maid. The wife said in a rage: Thou sayest I am wrong in the presence of my maid? The Rabbi answered: I do as Job did.)<p>not as singular (ennu  equals  e&#770;hu), but as plural (ennu  equals  e&#770;nu); The Babylonian school pointed &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, like &#1502;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493; where it signifies a nobis, &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (Psalter ii. 459, and further information in Pinsker's works, Zur Geschichte des Karaismus, and Ueber das sogen. assyrische Punktationssystem). Therefore: One, i.e., one and the same God, has fashioned us in the womb without our co-operation, in an equally animal way, which smites down all pride, in like absolute conditionedness. </body></html>
