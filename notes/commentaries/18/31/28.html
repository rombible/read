Through the determination to be rich, numbers ruin their souls, or pierce themselves with many sorrows. 2. He never was guilty of idolatry. The source of idolatry is in the heart, and it corrupts men, and provokes God to send judgments upon a nation. 3. He neither desired nor delighted in the hurt of the worst enemy he had. If others bear malice to us, that will not justify us in bearing malice to them. 4. He had never been unkind to strangers.

It is possible, also, that this might have been elsewhere in the patriarchal times a crime punishable in this manner. At all events, Job regarded it as a heinous offence, and one of which the magistrate ought to take cognizance.<p>For I should have denied the God that is above - The worship of the heavenly bodies would have been in fact the denial of the existence of any Superior Being.

The Mosaic law embodied subsequently the feeling of the godly from the earliest times against idolatry, as deserving judicial penalties: being treason against the Supreme King (De 13:9; 17:2-7; Eze 8:14-18).

And this did not cease to be his duty, although the magistrates of the world in Job’s time were so far from this, that they themselves also were idolaters. Yet considering that both Job and his friends, who lived in his time and neighbourhood, were most probably the posterity or kindred of Abraham and his family, and by him or his instructed in the knowledge of the true God, and were also men of great power and authority in their places; it seems most likely that they did restrain and punish idolatry in their several jurisdictions, or at least in their own large and numerous families, where the masters anciently had power of life and death without control. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I should have denied God; </span> not directly, (for nothing is more evident than this, that divers of the wiser heathens, who did worship the sun and moon, did yet acknowledge and adore the sovereign and supreme God over and above all,) but by consequence and construction, because this was to rob God of his prerogative, by giving to the creature that religious honour or worship which is peculiar to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That is above; </span> who is above the sun and moon, not only in place, his glorious mansion and palace being far above all visible heavens, but also in power and dignity, or adorable excellency. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge,....

Such adoration would have been a “denial” of, or a being false to, God, the one spiritual God, above. Much more than a thousand years later Mohammed has still to say to his Arabs, “Worship not the sun, neither the moon: but worship God who created them,” Kor. ch. 41. A pretty fable is told also of Abraham—“When night closed over him he saw a star, and said, This is my Lord; but when it set he said, I love not those that set. And when he saw the moon appearing he said, This is my Lord; but when it set he said, Surely if my Lord direct me not aright I shall be of the people that go astray. And when he saw the sun rising he said, This is my Lord, this is the greatest; but when it set he said, O my people, verily I am clear of what ye associate with God; verily I have turned my face towards Him who hath created heaven and earth,” &c.

It is rightly concluded from this expression that, in the country and age of Job, the sort of idolatry which is here mentioned was practised by some, and also that it was legally punishable. <span class="cmt_word">For I should have denied the God that is above</span>. The worship of any other god besides the supreme God is, practically, atheism, since "no man can serve two  masters." Moreover, to set up two independent gods is to destroy the idea of God, which implies supremacy over every other being. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>19  If I saw one perishing without clothing,<p>And that the needy had no covering;<p>20  If his loins blessed me not,<p>And he did not warm himself from the hide of my lambs;<p>21  If I have lifted up my hand over the orphan,<p>Because I saw my help in the gate:<p>22  Let my shoulder fall out of its shoulder-blade,<p>And mine arm be broken from its bone;<p>23  For terror would come upon me, the destruction of God,<p>And before His majesty I should not be able to stand.<p>On &#1488;&#1493;&#1489;&#1491; comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; he who is come down from his right place and is perishing (root &#1489;&#1491;, to separate, still perfectly visible through the Arab. ba&#770;da, ba&#8219;ida, to perish), or also he who is already perished, periens and perditus.

The shaking, &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;, of the hand, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21</a>, is intended, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a> (comp. the Pilel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-32.htm">Isaiah 10:32</a>), <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>, as a preparation for a crushing stroke. Job refrained himself from such designs upon the defenceless orphan, even when he saw his help in the gate, i.e., before the tribunal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>), i.e., even when he had a certain prospect or powerful assistance there. If he has acted otherwise, his &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;, i.e., his upper arm together with the shoulder, must fall out from its &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501;, i.e., the back which bears it together with the shoulder-blades, and his &#1488;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, upper and lower arm, which is considered here according to its outward flesh, must be broken out of its &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, tube, i.e., the reed-like hollow bone which gives support to it, i.e., be broken asunder from its basis (Syr. a radice sua), this sinning arm, which did not compassionate the naked, and mercilessly threatened the defenceless and helpless. The &#1514; raphatum which follows in both cases, and the express testimony of the Masora, show that &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; have no Mappik.

But &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; is not favourable to this. It establishes the particular thing which he imprecates upon himself, and that consequently which, according to his own conviction and perception, ought justly to overtake him out of the general mass, viz., that terror ought to come upon him, a divine decreed weight of affliction. &#1488;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500; is a permutative of &#1508;&#1495;&#1491;  equals  &#1508;&#1495;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; with Dech equivalent to &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; (&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;) &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a> (where it is to be interpreted: and that thou lettest no fear before me come over thee).
