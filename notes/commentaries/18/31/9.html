Lust is a fire in the soul: those that indulge it, are said to burn. It consumes all that is good there, and lays the conscience waste. It kindles the fire of God's wrath, which, if not quenched by the blood of Christ, will consume even to eternal destruction. It consumes the body; it consumes the substance. Burning lusts bring burning judgments. Job had a numerous household, and he managed it well. He considered that he had a Master in heaven; and as we are undone if God should be severe with us, we ought to be mild and gentle towards all with whom we have to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If mine heart have been deceived by a woman - If I have been enticed by her beauty.

The phrase is very emphatical, taking from himself and others the vain excuses wherewith men use to palliate their sins, by pretending that they did not design the wickedness, but were merely drawn in and seduced by the strong enticements and provocations of others; all which Job supposeth, and yet nevertheless owns the great guilt of such practices even in that case, as well knowing that temptation to sin is no justification of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Laid wait at my neighbour’s door; </span> watching for a fit opportunity to defile his wife.

Job is not an Israelite, he is without the pale of the positive, Sinaitic revelation; his religion is the old patriarchal religion, which even in the present day is called d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m (the religion of Abraham), or d&#305;&#770;n el-bedu (the religion of the steppe) as the religion of those Arabs who are not Moslem, or at least influenced by the penetrating Islamism, and is called by Meja&#770;n&#305;&#770;sh&#305;&#770; el-han&#305;&#770;f&#305;&#770;je (vid., supra, p. 362, note) as the patriarchally orthodox religion.<p>(Note: Also in the Merg district east of Damascus, which is peopled by an ancient unmixed race, because the fever which prevails there kills strangers, remnants of the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m have been preserved despite the penetrating Islamism. There the mulaqqin (Souffleur), who says the creed into the grave as a farewell to the buried one, adds the following words: "The muslim is my brother, the muslima my sister, Abraham is my father (ab&#305;&#770;), his religion (d&#305;&#770;nuh) is mine, and his confession (medhebuh) mine." It is indisputable that the words muslim (one who is submissive to God) and islm (submission to God) have originally belonged to the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m. It is also remarkable that the Moslem salutation sela&#770;m occurs only as a sign in war among the wandering tribes, and that the guest parts from his host with the words: da&#770;ima&#770; besa&#770;t el-Chal&#305;&#770;l&#770; la&#770; maqtu&#770;&#8219; wala&#770; memnu&#770;&#8219;, i.e., mayest thou always have Abraham's table, and plenty of provisions and guests. - Wetzst.)<p>As little as this religion, even in the present day, is acquainted with the specific Mohammedan commandments, so little knew Job of the specifically Israelitish. On the contrary, his confession, which he lays down in this third monologue, coincides remarkably with the ten commandments of piety (el-fela&#770;h) peculiar to the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m, although it differs in this respect, that it does not give the prominence to submission to the dispensations of God, that tesl&#305;&#770;m which, as the whole of this didactic poem teaches by its issue, is the duty of the perfectly pious; also bravery in defence of holy property and rights is wanting, which among the wandering tribes is accounted as an essential part of the hebbet er-r&#305;&#770;h (inspiration of the Divine Being), i.e., active piety, and to which it is similarly related, as to the binding notion of "honour" which was coined by the western chivalry of the middle ages.<p>Job begins with the duty of chastity. Consistently with the prologue, which the drama itself nowhere belies, he is living in monogamy, as at the present day the orthodox Arabs, averse to Islamism, are not addicted to Moslem polygamy. With the confession of having maintained this marriage (although, to infer from the prologue, it was not an over-happy, deeply sympathetic one) sacred, and restrained himself not only from every adulterous act, but also from adulterous desires, his confessions begin. Here, in the middle of the Old Testament, without the pale of the Old Testament &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, we meet just that moral strictness and depth with which the Preacher on the mount, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27</a>., opposes the spirit to the letter of the seventh commandment. It is &#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, designedly; &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1514; is the usual phrase where two equals are concerned; on the contrary, &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500; where two the superior - Jehovah, or a king, or conqueror - binds himself to another under prescribed conditions, or the covenant is made not so much by a mutual advance as by the one taking the initiative. In this latter case, the secondary notions of a promise given (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>), or even, as here, of a law prescribed, are combined with &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;: "as lord of my senses I prescribed this law for my eyes" (Ew.). The eyes, says a Talmudic proverb, are the procuresses of sin (&#1505;&#1512;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1492; &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;); "to close his eyes, that they may not feast on evil," is, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>, a clearly defined line in the picture of him on whom the everlasting burnings can have no hold.

Conscious of the just punishment of the unchaste, and, as he adds in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-4.htm">Job 31:4</a>, of the omniscience of the heavenly Judge, Job has made dominion over sin, even in its first beginnings and motions, his principle.<p>The &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, which gives prominence to the subject, means Him who punishes the unchaste.
