Through the determination to be rich, numbers ruin their souls, or pierce themselves with many sorrows. 2. He never was guilty of idolatry. The source of idolatry is in the heart, and it corrupts men, and provokes God to send judgments upon a nation. 3. He neither desired nor delighted in the hurt of the worst enemy he had. If others bear malice to us, that will not justify us in bearing malice to them. 4. He had never been unkind to strangers.

The subject referred to is the proper treatment of those who injure us. In respect to this, he says that he was entirely conscious of freedom from exultation when calamity came upon a foe, and that he had never even wished him evil in his heart. The word "destruction" here, means calamity, disappointment, or affliction of any kind. It had never been pleasant to him to see one who hated him suffer. It is needless to remark how entirely this accords with the New Testament. And it is pleasant to find such a sentiment as this expressed in the early age of the world, and to see how the influence of true religion is at all times the same. The religion of Job led him to act out the beautiful sentiment afterward embodied in the instructions of the Savior, and made binding on all his followers; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>. True religion will lead a man to act out what is embodied in its precepts, whether they are expressed in formal language or not.<p>Or lifted up myself - Been elated or rejoiced.<p>When evil found him - When calamity overtook him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. lifted up myself&#8212;in malicious triumph (Pr 17:5; 24:17; Ps 7:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I was so far from malice and revenging myself of mine enemy, which is the common and allowed practice of ungodly men, that I did not so much as desire or delight in his ruin, when it was brought upon him by other hands.

Job, though a good man, had his enemies, as all good men have, and that because of their goodness, and who hated him with an implacable hatred, without a cause, there being a rooted bitter enmity in the seed of the serpent against the godly in all generations; on whom sooner or later, at one time or another, destruction comes, one calamity or another on their families, diseases on their bodies, loss of substance, death of themselves or relatives; now it is a common thing with wicked men to rejoice in the adversity of their enemies, but good men should not do so; yet it is a difficult thing, and requires a large measure of grace, and that in exercise, not to feel any pleasing emotion, a secret joy and inward pleasure, at the hearing of anything of this sort befalling an enemy; which is a new crime Job purges himself from: <p>or lifted up myself when evil found him; either the evil of sin, which sooner or later finds out the sinner, charges him with guilt, and requires punishment, or the evil of punishment for sin; which, though it may seem to move slowly, pursues the sinner, and will overtake him, and light upon him. Mr. Broughton renders the words, "and bestirred me when he found loss": loss in his family, in his cattle, and in his substance; now, when this was the case, Job did not raise up himself in a haughty manner, and insult and triumph over him, or stir up himself to joy and rejoicing, or to make joyful motions, as Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom interpret it; and by his gestures show that he was elated with the evil that had befallen his enemy; indeed so far as the fall and destruction of the wicked make for the public good, for the interest of religion, for the glory of God, and the honour of his justice, it is lawful for good men to rejoice thereat; but not from a private affection, or from a private spirit of revenge, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">at the destruction</span>] Or, at the <span class="bld">misfortune</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm" title="He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.">Job 12:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lift up myself</span>] Or, <span class="bld">exalted</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me</span>.

In the old world men generally regarded themselves as fully entitled to exult at the downfall of an enemy, and to triumph over him with words of contumely and scorn (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-37.htm">Psalm 18:37-42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>-1.4, etc.). There appears to be but one other passage in the Old Testament, besides the present, in which the contrary disposition is shown. This is <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>, where the writer declares that "he who is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>19  If I saw one perishing without clothing,<p>And that the needy had no covering;<p>20  If his loins blessed me not,<p>And he did not warm himself from the hide of my lambs;<p>21  If I have lifted up my hand over the orphan,<p>Because I saw my help in the gate:<p>22  Let my shoulder fall out of its shoulder-blade,<p>And mine arm be broken from its bone;<p>23  For terror would come upon me, the destruction of God,<p>And before His majesty I should not be able to stand.<p>On &#1488;&#1493;&#1489;&#1491; comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; he who is come down from his right place and is perishing (root &#1489;&#1491;, to separate, still perfectly visible through the Arab. ba&#770;da, ba&#8219;ida, to perish), or also he who is already perished, periens and perditus. The clause, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-19.htm">Job 31:19</a>, forms the second obj. to &#1488;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, which otherwise signifies si video, but here, in accordance with the connection, signifies si videbam. The blessing of the thankful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>) is transferred from the person to the limbs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-20.htm">Job 31:20</a>, which need and are benefited by the warmth imparted. &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; here is not an expression of an affirmative asseveration, but a negative turn to the continuation of the hypothetical antecedents. The shaking, &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;, of the hand, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21</a>, is intended, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a> (comp. the Pilel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-32.htm">Isaiah 10:32</a>), <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>, as a preparation for a crushing stroke. Job refrained himself from such designs upon the defenceless orphan, even when he saw his help in the gate, i.e., before the tribunal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>), i.e., even when he had a certain prospect or powerful assistance there. If he has acted otherwise, his &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;, i.e., his upper arm together with the shoulder, must fall out from its &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501;, i.e., the back which bears it together with the shoulder-blades, and his &#1488;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, upper and lower arm, which is considered here according to its outward flesh, must be broken out of its &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, tube, i.e., the reed-like hollow bone which gives support to it, i.e., be broken asunder from its basis (Syr. a radice sua), this sinning arm, which did not compassionate the naked, and mercilessly threatened the defenceless and helpless. The &#1514; raphatum which follows in both cases, and the express testimony of the Masora, show that &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; have no Mappik. The He quiescens, however, is in both instances softened from the He mappic. of the suff., Ew. 21,f. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-23.htm">Job 31:23</a> is taken by most expositors as predicate: for terror is (was) to me evil as God, the righteous judge, decrees it. But &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; is not favourable to this. It establishes the particular thing which he imprecates upon himself, and that consequently which, according to his own conviction and perception, ought justly to overtake him out of the general mass, viz., that terror ought to come upon him, a divine decreed weight of affliction. &#1488;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500; is a permutative of &#1508;&#1495;&#1491;  equals  &#1508;&#1495;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; with Dech equivalent to &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; (&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;) &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a> (where it is to be interpreted: and that thou lettest no fear before me come over thee). Thus also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-23.htm">Job 31:23</a> is suitably connected with the preceding: and I should not overcome His majesty, i.e., I should succumb to it. The &#1502;&#1503; corresponds to the prae in praevalerem; &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; (lxx falsely, &#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, judgment, decision  equals  &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, Jer. pondus) is not intended otherwise than <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-11.htm">Job 13:11</a> (parall. &#1508;&#1495;&#1491; as here). </body></html>
