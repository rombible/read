That he never set his heart upon the wealth of this world. How few prosperous professors can appeal to the Lord, that they have not rejoiced because their gains were great! Through the determination to be rich, numbers ruin their souls, or pierce themselves with many sorrows. 2. He never was guilty of idolatry. The source of idolatry is in the heart, and it corrupts men, and provokes God to send judgments upon a nation. 3. He neither desired nor delighted in the hurt of the worst enemy he had. If others bear malice to us, that will not justify us in bearing malice to them. 4. He had never been unkind to strangers.

The word used here &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;  'o&#770;rach means properly way, path, road; but it also denotes those who travel on such a way; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>, "The troops of Tema looked," Hebrew &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; &#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1488;  te&#770;yma&#770;' 'o&#770;rach - the ways, or paths of Tema; that is, those who traveled in those paths. Vulgate here, viatori. Septuagint, "To everyone that came" - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;  panti elthonti. This was one of the methods of hospitality - the central and crowning virtue among the Arabs to this day, and among the Orientals in all ages. Among the boasts of hospitality, showing the place which this virtue had in their estimation, and the methods by which it was practiced, we may refer to such expressions as the following: "I occupy the public way with my tent;" that is, to every traveler without distinction, my tent is open and my table is spread. "He makes the public path the place for the cords of his tent;" that is, he fixed the pins and cords of his tent in the midst of the public highway, so that every traveler might enter. These examples are quoted by Schultens from the Hamasa. Another beautiful example may be taken from the same collection of Arabic poems. I give the Latin translation of Schultens:<p>Quam saepe latratum imitanti viatori, cui resonabat echo<p>Suscitavi ignem, cujus lignum luculentum<p>Properusque surrexi ad eum, ut praedae mihi loco esset,<p>Prae metu ne populus mens eum ante me occuparet.<p>That is, "How often to the traveler, imitating the bark of the dog, and the echo of whose voice was heard, have I kindled a fire, the shining wood of which I quick raised up to him, as one would hasten to the prey, in fear lest someone of my own people should anticipate me in the privileges and rites of hospitality." The allusion to the imitation of the barking of a dog here, refers to the custom of travelers at night, who make this noise when they need a place of rest. This sound is responded to by the dogs which watch around the tents of their masters, and the sound is the signal for a general rush to show hospitality to the stranger. Burckhardt, speaking of the inhabitants of the Houran - the country east of the Jordan, and south of Damascus, says, "A traveler may alight at any house he pleases; a mat will be immediately spread for him, coffee made, and a breakfast or dinner set before him. In entering a village it has often happened to me, that several persons presented themselves, each begging that I would lodge at his house. It is a point of honor with the host never to receive the smallest return from a guest. Besides the private habitations, which offer to every traveler a secure night's shelter, there is in every village the Medhafe of the Sheikh, where all strangers of decent appearance are received and entertained. It is the duty of the Sheikh to maintain this Medhafe, which is like a tavern, with the difference that the host himself pays the bill. The Sheikh has public allowance to defray these expenses, and hence a man of the Houran, intending to travel about for a fortnight never thinks of putting a single para in his pocket; he is sure of being every where well received, and of living better, perhaps, than at his own home."

The two words &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; &#1492;&#1500;&#1491; describe with exceeding beauty the solemn majestic wandering of the moon; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; is acc. of closer definition, like &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>, and this "brilliantly rolling on" is the acc. of the predicate to &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, corresponding to the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, "that (or how) it shoots forth rays" (Hiph. of &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;, distinct from &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>), or even: that it shot forth rays (fut. in signif. of an imperf. as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-17.htm">Genesis 48:17</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a> proceeds with futt. consec. in order to express the effect which this imposing spectacle of the luminaries of the day and of the night might have produced on him, but has not. The Kal &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468; is to be understood as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16</a> (comp. ib. iv. 19, &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;): it was enticed, gave way to the seducing influence. Kissing is called &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; as being a joining of lip to lip. Accordingly the kiss by hand can be described by &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491; &#1500;&#1508;&#1492;; the kiss which the mouth gives the hand is to a certain extent also a kiss which the hand gives the mouth, since the hand joins itself to the mouth. Thus to kiss the hand in the direction of the object of veneration, or also to turn to it the kissed hand and at the same time the kiss which fastens on it (as compensation for the direct kiss, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>), is the proper gesture of the &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; and adoratio mentioned; comp. Pliny, h. n. xxviii. 2, 5; Inter adorandum dexteram ad osculum referimus et totum corpus circumagimus. Tacitus, Hist. iii. 24, says that in Syria they value the rising sun; and that this was done by kissing the hand (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) in Western Asia as in Greece, is to be inferred from Lucians &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, c. xvii.<p>(Note: Vid., Freund's Lat. Wrterbuch s. v. adorare, and K. Fr. Hermann's Gottesdienstliche Alterth. der Griechen, c. xxi. 16, but especially Excursus 123 in Dougtaeus' Analecta.)<p>In the passage before us Ew. finds an indication of the spread of the Zoroaster doctrine in the beginning of the seventh century b.c., at which period he is of opinion the book of Job was composed, but without any ground. The ancient Persian worship has no knowledge of the act of adoration by throwing a kiss; and the Avesta recognises in the sun and moon exalted genii, but created by Ahuramazda, and consequently not such as are to be worshipped as gods. On the other hand, star-worship is everywhere the oldest and also comparatively the purest form of heathenism. That the ancient Arabs, especially the Himjarites, adored the sun, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, and the moon, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1503; (&#1505;&#1497;&#1503;, whence &#1505;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, the mountain dedicated to the moon), as divine, we know from the ancient testimonies,<p>continued...</body></html>
