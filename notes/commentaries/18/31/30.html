That he never set his heart upon the wealth of this world. How few prosperous professors can appeal to the Lord, that they have not rejoiced because their gains were great! Through the determination to be rich, numbers ruin their souls, or pierce themselves with many sorrows. 2. He never was guilty of idolatry. The source of idolatry is in the heart, and it corrupts men, and provokes God to send judgments upon a nation. 3. He neither desired nor delighted in the hurt of the worst enemy he had. If others bear malice to us, that will not justify us in bearing malice to them. 4. He had never been unkind to strangers.

The word is often used for the mouth in general, and especially as the organ of the voice from the use and importance of the palate in speaking. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-7.htm">Proverbs 8:7</a>. "For my palate (&#1495;&#1499;&#1497;  chikiy) speaketh truth." It is used as the organ of taste, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-30.htm">Job 6:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>.<p>By wishing a curse to his soul - It must have been an extraordinary degree of piety which would permit a man to say this with truth, that he had never harbored a wish of injury to an enemy. Few are the people, probably, even now, who could say this, and who are enabled to keep their minds free from every wish that calamities and woes may overtake those who are seeking their hurt. Yet this is the nature of true religion. It controls the heart, represses the angry and revengeful feelings, and creates in the soul an earnest desire for the happiness even of those who injure us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. mouth&#8212;literally, "palate."

Job in the patriarchal age of the promise, anterior to the law, realizes the Gospel spirit, which was the end of the law (compare Le 19:18; De 23:6, with Mt 5:43, 44).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My mouth, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">my palate</span>, which being one of the instruments of speech, is put for another, or for all the rest.

The two words &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; &#1492;&#1500;&#1491; describe with exceeding beauty the solemn majestic wandering of the moon; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; is acc. of closer definition, like &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>, and this "brilliantly rolling on" is the acc. of the predicate to &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, corresponding to the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, "that (or how) it shoots forth rays" (Hiph. of &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;, distinct from &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>), or even: that it shot forth rays (fut. in signif. of an imperf. as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-17.htm">Genesis 48:17</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a> proceeds with futt. consec. in order to express the effect which this imposing spectacle of the luminaries of the day and of the night might have produced on him, but has not. The Kal &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468; is to be understood as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16</a> (comp. ib. iv. 19, &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;): it was enticed, gave way to the seducing influence. Kissing is called &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; as being a joining of lip to lip. Accordingly the kiss by hand can be described by &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491; &#1500;&#1508;&#1492;; the kiss which the mouth gives the hand is to a certain extent also a kiss which the hand gives the mouth, since the hand joins itself to the mouth. Thus to kiss the hand in the direction of the object of veneration, or also to turn to it the kissed hand and at the same time the kiss which fastens on it (as compensation for the direct kiss, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>), is the proper gesture of the &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; and adoratio mentioned; comp. Pliny, h. n. xxviii. 2, 5; Inter adorandum dexteram ad osculum referimus et totum corpus circumagimus. Tacitus, Hist. iii. 24, says that in Syria they value the rising sun; and that this was done by kissing the hand (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) in Western Asia as in Greece, is to be inferred from Lucians &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, c. xvii.<p>(Note: Vid., Freund's Lat. Wrterbuch s. v. adorare, and K. Fr. Hermann's Gottesdienstliche Alterth. der Griechen, c. xxi. 16, but especially Excursus 123 in Dougtaeus' Analecta.)<p>In the passage before us Ew. finds an indication of the spread of the Zoroaster doctrine in the beginning of the seventh century b.c., at which period he is of opinion the book of Job was composed, but without any ground. The ancient Persian worship has no knowledge of the act of adoration by throwing a kiss; and the Avesta recognises in the sun and moon exalted genii, but created by Ahuramazda, and consequently not such as are to be worshipped as gods. On the other hand, star-worship is everywhere the oldest and also comparatively the purest form of heathenism. That the ancient Arabs, especially the Himjarites, adored the sun, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, and the moon, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1503; (&#1505;&#1497;&#1503;, whence &#1505;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, the mountain dedicated to the moon), as divine, we know from the ancient testimonies,<p>continued...</body></html>
