We are loth to confess our faults, willing to excuse them, and to lay the blame upon others. But he that thus covers his sins, shall not prosper, Pr 28:13. He speaks of his courage in what is good, as an evidence of his sincerity in it. When men get estates unjustly, they are justly deprived of comfort from them; it was sown wheat, but shall come up thistles. What men do not come honestly by, will never do them any good. The words of Job are ended. They end with a bold assertion, that, with respect to accusation against his moral and religious character as the cause for his sufferings, he could appeal to God. But, however confident Job was, we shall see he was mistaken, chap. 40:4,5; 1Jo 1:8. Let us all judge ourselves; wherein we are guilty, let us seek forgiveness in that blood which cleanseth from all sin; and may the Lord have mercy upon us, and write his laws in our hearts!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I covered my transgressions as Adam - That is, if I have attempted to hide or conceal them; if, conscious of guilt, I have endeavored to cloak my sins, and to appear righteous. There has been great variety of opinion about the meaning of this expression. The margin reads it, "After the manner of men." Luther, renders it, "Have I covered my wickedness as a man" - Habe ich meine Schalkheit wie ein Menseh gedecht. Coverdale, "Have I ever done any wicked deed where through I shamed myself before men." Herder, "Did I hide my faults like a mean man." Schultens, "If I have covered my sin as Adam." The Vulgate, Quasi homo - "as a man." The Septuagint, "If when I sinned unwillingly (&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  akousio&#772;s - inadvertently, undesignedly) I concealed my sin." Noyes, "After the manner of men." Umbreit, Nach Menschenart - "After the manner of men." Rosenmuller, As Adam. The Chaldee, &#1499;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, meaning, as Rosenmuller remarks, as Adam; and the Syriac, As men.<p>The meaning may either be, as people are accustomed to do when they commit a crime - referring to the common practice of the guilty to attempt to cloak their offences, or to the attempt of Adam to hide his sin from his Maker after the fall; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7-8</a>. It is not possible to decide with certainty which is the correct interpretation, for either will accord with the Hebrew. But in favor of the supposition that it refers to the effort of Adam to conceal his sin, we may remark, (1.) That there can be little or no doubt that that transaction was known to Job by tradition. (2.) it furnished him a pertinent and striking illustration of the point before him. (3.) the illustration is, by supposing that it refers to him, much more striking than on the other supposition. It is true that people often attempt to conceal their guilt, and that it may be set down as a fact very general in its character; but still it is not so universal that there are no exceptions. But here was a specific and well-known case, and one which, as it was the first, so it was the most sad and melancholy instance that had ever occurred of an attempt to conceal guilt. It was not an attempt, to hide it from man - for there was then no other man to witness it; but an attempt to hide it from God. From such an attempt Job says he was free.<p>By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom - By attempting to conceal it so that others would not know it. Adam attempted to conceal his fault even from God; and it is common with people, when they have done wrong, to endeavor to hide it from others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. Adam&#8212;translated by Umbreit, "as men do" (Ho 6:7, where see Margin). But English Version is more natural. The very same word for "hiding" is used in Ge 3:8, 10, of Adam hiding himself from God. Job elsewhere alludes to the flood. So he might easily know of the fall, through the two links which connect Adam and Abraham (about Job's time), namely, Methuselah and Shem. Adam is representative of fallen man's propensity to concealment (Pr 28:13). It was from God that Job did not "hide his iniquity in his bosom," as on the contrary it was from God that "Adam" hid in his lurking-place. This disproves the translation, "as men"; for it is from their fellow men that "men" are chiefly anxious to hide their real character as guilty. Magee, to make the comparison with Adam more exact, for my "bosom" translates, "lurking-place."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This he adds to prevent or answer an objection.

If I used all this care and caution in my carriage towards strangers, and enemies, and others only as a cloak to any secret and subtle way of wickedness, such as you accuse me of, and did not seek to purge out all sin as in God’s sight, but only to hide my sins from men, and to have the better opportunity for oppressing others, or indulging myself in any other close sin, under a colour, and with a reputation of justice and holiness. <span class="ital">As Adam</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Job could not be understood, by this account he had given of the holiness of his life, that he thought himself quite free from sin; he had owned himself to be a sinner in several places before, and disclaimed perfection; and here he acknowledges he was guilty of transgressing the law of God, and that in many instances; for he speaks of his "transgressions" in the plural number; but then he did not seek to cover them from the of God or men, but frankly and ingenuously confessed them to both; he did not cover them, palliate, excuse, and extenuate them, as Adam did his, by laying the blame to his wife; and as she by charging it on the serpent; and those excuses they made are the inventions they found out, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-29.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:29</a>; or the meaning is, Job did not do "as men" (k) in common do; who, when they have sinned, either through fear or shame, endeavour to conceal it, and keep it out of the sight of others, unless they are very hardened and audacious sinners, such as the men of Sodom were, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a>; <p>by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom; meaning perhaps some particular iniquity which his nature was most inclined to; this he did not attempt to hide in secret, as what is put into the bosom is; or that he did not spare it and cherish it, and, from an affection to it, keep it as persons and things beloved are, laid in the bosom; and so Mr. Broughton reads the words, "hiding my sin of a self-love"; either having a self-love to it, or hiding it of self-love, that is, from a principle of self-love, to preserve his honour, credit, and reputation among men. <p>(k) "ut homo", V.

The religious traditions of the Chaldees, which note the war in heaven, the Deluge, the building of the Tower of Babel, and the confusion of tongues, contain no mention of Adam or of Paradise.

The two words &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; &#1492;&#1500;&#1491; describe with exceeding beauty the solemn majestic wandering of the moon; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; is acc. of closer definition, like &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>, and this "brilliantly rolling on" is the acc. of the predicate to &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, corresponding to the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, "that (or how) it shoots forth rays" (Hiph. of &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;, distinct from &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>), or even: that it shot forth rays (fut. in signif. of an imperf. as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-17.htm">Genesis 48:17</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a> proceeds with futt. consec. in order to express the effect which this imposing spectacle of the luminaries of the day and of the night might have produced on him, but has not. The Kal &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468; is to be understood as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16</a> (comp. ib. iv. 19, &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;): it was enticed, gave way to the seducing influence. Kissing is called &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; as being a joining of lip to lip. Accordingly the kiss by hand can be described by &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491; &#1500;&#1508;&#1492;; the kiss which the mouth gives the hand is to a certain extent also a kiss which the hand gives the mouth, since the hand joins itself to the mouth. Thus to kiss the hand in the direction of the object of veneration, or also to turn to it the kissed hand and at the same time the kiss which fastens on it (as compensation for the direct kiss, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>), is the proper gesture of the &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; and adoratio mentioned; comp. Pliny, h. n. xxviii. 2, 5; Inter adorandum dexteram ad osculum referimus et totum corpus circumagimus. Tacitus, Hist. iii. 24, says that in Syria they value the rising sun; and that this was done by kissing the hand (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) in Western Asia as in Greece, is to be inferred from Lucians &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, c. xvii.<p>(Note: Vid., Freund's Lat.

The ancient Persian worship has no knowledge of the act of adoration by throwing a kiss; and the Avesta recognises in the sun and moon exalted genii, but created by Ahuramazda, and consequently not such as are to be worshipped as gods. On the other hand, star-worship is everywhere the oldest and also comparatively the purest form of heathenism.
