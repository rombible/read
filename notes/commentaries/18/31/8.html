He understood the spiritual nature of God's commandments, as reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is best to let our actions speak for us; but in some cases we owe it to ourselves and to the cause of God, solemnly to protest our innocence of the crimes of which we are falsely accused. The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are two fatal rocks on which multitudes split; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard. And God takes more exact notice of us than we do of ourselves; let us therefore walk circumspectly. He carefully avoided all sinful means of getting wealth. He dreaded all forbidden profit as much as all forbidden pleasure. What we have in the world may be used with comfort, or lost with comfort, if honestly gotten. Without strict honestly and faithfulness in all our dealings, we can have no good evidence of true godliness. Yet how many professors are unable to abide this touchstone!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then let me sow, and let another eat - This is the imprecation which he invokes, in case he had been guilty in this respect. He consented to sow his fields, and let others enjoy the harvest. The expression used here is common in the Scriptures to denote insecurity of property or calamity in general; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a> : "And ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it;" compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13-14</a>.<p>Yea, let my offspring be rooted out - Or, rather, "Let what I plant be rooted up." So Umbreit, Noyes, Schultens, Rosenmuller, Herder, and Lee understand it. There is no evidence that he here alludes to his children, for the connection does not demand it, nor does the word used here require such an interpretation. The word &#1510;&#1488;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;  tse'e&#774;tsa&#770;'iym - means properly shoots; that is, what springs out of anything - as the earth, or a tree - from &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;  ya&#770;tsa&#770;' - to go out, to go forth. It is applied to the productions of the earth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1</a>, and to children or posterity, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-24.htm">Isaiah 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-9.htm">Isaiah 61:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-25.htm">Job 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-8.htm">Job 21:8</a>. Here it refers evidently to the productions of the earth; and the idea is, that if he had been guilty of dishonesty or fraud in his dealings, he wished that all that he had sowed should be rooted up. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

If what he had before said was not true; but he had turned out of the way of righteousness, and walked after the sight of his eyes, and the mammon of unrighteousness cleaved to his hands; then he wishes might sow his fields, and another enjoy the increase of them, which is one of God's judgments threatened unto the wicked and disobedient, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>; <p>let my offspring be rooted out; but Job had no offspring or children at this time to be rooted out or destroyed; they were all destroyed already; some think therefore that this imprecation was made by him in the time of his prosperity, though here repeated as it was then, he made a covenant with his eyes; but then this might have been improved against him and retorted on him, that so it was according to his wish; and therefore he must have been guilty of the sin he would have purged himself from; others suppose that he refers to the future, and to the offspring he hoped to have hereafter; and when he should have them, wishes they may be rooted out, if he had done what he denies he had; but it does not appear that Job had any hope at all of being restored to his former state of prosperity, and of being possessed of a family and substance again, but the reverse. Gussetius (a) will have it, that he means his grandchildren; those indeed are sometimes called a man's children, and may propriety be said to be his offspring, they springing frown him; and it is possible, that, as his sons were settled from him, they were married and had children; but this is not certain, or, if they had any, that these were not destroyed with them; wherefore it is best to take the word (b) in its first and literal sense, for what springs out of the earth, herbs, plants, and trees, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; so Ben Gersom and Bar Tzemach, and which best agrees with the phrase of being "rooted out", and with what goes before; that as he had wished that which was sown in his fields might be eaten up by another, so what was planted and grew up in his gardens, orchards, vineyards, and olive yards, and the like, might be quite rooted out and destroyed; if he was not the man he declared himself to be, or had wronged any of their goods and property, then this would have been a just retaliation of him. <p>(a) Comment.

Job is not an Israelite, he is without the pale of the positive, Sinaitic revelation; his religion is the old patriarchal religion, which even in the present day is called d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m (the religion of Abraham), or d&#305;&#770;n el-bedu (the religion of the steppe) as the religion of those Arabs who are not Moslem, or at least influenced by the penetrating Islamism, and is called by Meja&#770;n&#305;&#770;sh&#305;&#770; el-han&#305;&#770;f&#305;&#770;je (vid., supra, p. 362, note) as the patriarchally orthodox religion.<p>(Note: Also in the Merg district east of Damascus, which is peopled by an ancient unmixed race, because the fever which prevails there kills strangers, remnants of the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m have been preserved despite the penetrating Islamism. There the mulaqqin (Souffleur), who says the creed into the grave as a farewell to the buried one, adds the following words: "The muslim is my brother, the muslima my sister, Abraham is my father (ab&#305;&#770;), his religion (d&#305;&#770;nuh) is mine, and his confession (medhebuh) mine." It is indisputable that the words muslim (one who is submissive to God) and islm (submission to God) have originally belonged to the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m. It is also remarkable that the Moslem salutation sela&#770;m occurs only as a sign in war among the wandering tribes, and that the guest parts from his host with the words: da&#770;ima&#770; besa&#770;t el-Chal&#305;&#770;l&#770; la&#770; maqtu&#770;&#8219; wala&#770; memnu&#770;&#8219;, i.e., mayest thou always have Abraham's table, and plenty of provisions and guests. - Wetzst.)<p>As little as this religion, even in the present day, is acquainted with the specific Mohammedan commandments, so little knew Job of the specifically Israelitish. On the contrary, his confession, which he lays down in this third monologue, coincides remarkably with the ten commandments of piety (el-fela&#770;h) peculiar to the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m, although it differs in this respect, that it does not give the prominence to submission to the dispensations of God, that tesl&#305;&#770;m which, as the whole of this didactic poem teaches by its issue, is the duty of the perfectly pious; also bravery in defence of holy property and rights is wanting, which among the wandering tribes is accounted as an essential part of the hebbet er-r&#305;&#770;h (inspiration of the Divine Being), i.e., active piety, and to which it is similarly related, as to the binding notion of "honour" which was coined by the western chivalry of the middle ages.<p>Job begins with the duty of chastity. Consistently with the prologue, which the drama itself nowhere belies, he is living in monogamy, as at the present day the orthodox Arabs, averse to Islamism, are not addicted to Moslem polygamy. With the confession of having maintained this marriage (although, to infer from the prologue, it was not an over-happy, deeply sympathetic one) sacred, and restrained himself not only from every adulterous act, but also from adulterous desires, his confessions begin. Here, in the middle of the Old Testament, without the pale of the Old Testament &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, we meet just that moral strictness and depth with which the Preacher on the mount, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27</a>., opposes the spirit to the letter of the seventh commandment. It is &#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, designedly; &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1514; is the usual phrase where two equals are concerned; on the contrary, &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500; where two the superior - Jehovah, or a king, or conqueror - binds himself to another under prescribed conditions, or the covenant is made not so much by a mutual advance as by the one taking the initiative. In this latter case, the secondary notions of a promise given (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>), or even, as here, of a law prescribed, are combined with &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;: "as lord of my senses I prescribed this law for my eyes" (Ew.). The eyes, says a Talmudic proverb, are the procuresses of sin (&#1505;&#1512;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1492; &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;); "to close his eyes, that they may not feast on evil," is, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>, a clearly defined line in the picture of him on whom the everlasting burnings can have no hold. The exclamation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>, is spoken with self-conscious indignation: Why should I... (comp. Joseph's exclamation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9</a>); Schultens correctly: est indignatio repellens vehementissime et negans tale quicquam committi par esse; the transition of the &#1502;&#1492;, Arab. ma&#770;, to the expression of negation, which is complete in Arabic, is here in its incipient state, Ew. 325, b. &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; &#1506;&#1500; is intended to express a fixed and inspection (comp. &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-21.htm">1 Kings 3:21</a>) gaze upon an object, combined with a lascivious imagination (comp.

Conscious of the just punishment of the unchaste, and, as he adds in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-4.htm">Job 31:4</a>, of the omniscience of the heavenly Judge, Job has made dominion over sin, even in its first beginnings and motions, his principle.<p>The &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, which gives prominence to the subject, means Him who punishes the unchaste.
