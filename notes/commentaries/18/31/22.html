He is most large upon this head, because in this matter he was particularly accused. He was tender of all, and hurtful to none. Notice the principles by which Job was restrained from being uncharitable and unmerciful. He stood in awe of the Lord, as certainly against him, if he should wrong the poor. Regard to worldly interests may restrain a man from actual crimes; but the grace of God alone can make him hate, dread, and shun sinful thoughts and desires.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then let mine arm - The strong language which Job uses here, shows his consciousness of innocence, and his detestation of the offences to which he here refers, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16-22</a>. The word rendered "arm" here (&#1499;&#1514;&#1507;  ka&#770;the&#770;ph) means properly the shoulder. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>. There is no instance, it is believed, unless this is one, in which it means arm, and the meaning here is, that he wished, if he had been guilty, his shoulder might separate from the blade. So Herder, Rosenmuller, Umbreit, and Noyes render it; and so the Vulgate and the Septuagint.<p>From my shoulder-blade - The scapula - the flat bone to which the upper arm is attached. The wish of Job is, that the shoulder might separate from that, and of course the arm would be useless. Such a strong imprecation implies a firm consciousness of innocence.<p>And mine arm - The word arm here denotes the forearm - the arm from the elbow to the fingers.<p>From the bone - Margin, "the chanelbone." Literally, "from the reed" - &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;  miqa&#770;neh. Umbreit renders it, Schneller als ein Rohr - quicker than a reed. The word &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;  qa&#770;neh means properly a reed, cane, calamus (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a>), and is here applied to the upper arm, or arm above the elbow, from its resemblance to a reed or cane. It is applied, also, to the arm or branch of a chandelier, or candlestick, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>, and to the rod or beam of a balance, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46.htm">Isaiah 46</a>.6. The meaning here is, that he wished that his arm should be broken at the elbow, or the forearm be separated from the upper arm, if he were guilty of the sins which he had specified. There is allusion, probably, and there is great force and propriety in the allusion, to what he had said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-2.htm">Job 31:2</a> l: "If his arm had been lifted up against an orphan, he prayed that it might fall powerless." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. Apodosis to Job 31:13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21. If I had done those crimes, I should have made a bad use of my influence ("my arm," figuratively, Job 31:21): therefore, if I have done them let my arm (literally) suffer. Job alludes to Eliphaz' charge (Job 22:9). The first "arm" is rather the shoulder. The second "arm" is the forearm.<p>from the bone&#8212;literally, "a reed"; hence the upper arm, above the elbow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I am contented that that arm which hath been so wickedly employed may either rot off, or fall out of joint, and so be useless and burdensome to me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade,.... With which the upper part of it is connected; let it be disjointed from it, or rot and drop off from it; a dreadful calamity this, to lose an arm and the use of it, to have it full off immediately, as a judgment from God, and in just retaliation for lifting up an hand or arm against the fatherless; as Jeroboam's arm withered when he put it forth from the altar, and ordered hands to be laid upon the prophet for crying against the altar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-4.htm">1 Kings 13:4</a>; and mine arm be broken from the bone; from the channel bone, as the margin of our Bibles, or rather from the elbow, the lower part of the arm and so may be rendered, "or mine arm", &amp;c. Eliphaz had brought a charge against Job, that the arms of the fatherless had been broken, and suggests that they had been broken by him, or by his orders, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-9.htm">Job 22:9</a>; and Job here wishes, that if that was the case, that his own arm was broken: such imprecations are not to be made in common, or frequently, and only when a man's innocence cannot be vindicated but by an appeal to the omniscient God; an instance somewhat like this, see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-5.htm">Psalm 137:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Then</i> let mine <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</span><p>(p) Let me rot in pieces.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>.

Since &#1502;&#1504;&#1506; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, cohibere aliquid ab aliquo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-7.htm">Job 22:7</a>), is said as much in accordance with the usage of the language as &#1502;&#1504;&#1506;&#1493; &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, cohibere aliquem ab aliquo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-11.htm">Numbers 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>), in the sense of denegare alicui aliquid, there is no reason for taking &#1502;&#1495;&#1508;&#1509; &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; together as a genitival clause (a voto tenuium), as the accentuation requires it. On &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>; it signifies solicitude (what is ardently desired) and business, here the former: what is ever the interest and want of the poor (the reduced or those without means). From such like things he does not keep the poor back, i.e., does not refuse them; and the eyes of the widow he did not cause or allow to languish (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, to bring to an end, i.e., cause to languish, of the eyes, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-33.htm">1 Samuel 2:33</a>); he let not their longing for assistance be consumed of itself, let not the fountain of their tears become dry without effect. If he had done the opposite, if he had eaten his bread (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;) alone, and not allowed the orphan to eat of it with him - but no, he had not acted thus; on the contrary (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a> and frequently), he (the parentless one) grew up to him (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;, Ges. 121, 4, according to Ew. 315, b, "by the interweaving of the dialects of the people into the ancient form of the declining language;" perhaps it is more correct to say it is by virtue of a poetic, forced, and rare brevity of expression) as to a father ( equals  &#1500;&#1488;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;), and from his mother's womb he guided her, the helpless and defenceless widow, like a faithful child leading its sick or aged mother. The hyperbolical expression &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; dates this sympathizing and active charity back to the very beginning of Job's life. He means to say that it is in-born to him, and he has exercised it ever since he was first able to do so. The brevity of the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;, brief to incorrectness, might be removed by the pointing &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; (Olsh.): from my youth up he (the fatherless one) honoured me as a father; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; (instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; would be explained by the consideration, that a veneration is meant that attributed a dignity which exceed his age to the &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; who was not yet old enough to be a father. But &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; signifies "to cause to grow" in such a connection elsewhere (parall. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, to raise), wherefore lxx translates &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;); and &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; has similar examples of the construction of intransitives with the acc. instead of the dat. (especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>) in its favour: they became me great, i.e., became great in respect of me. Other ways of getting over the difficulty are hardly worth mentioning: the Syriac version reads &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; (pain) and &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;; Raschi makes <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>, the idea of benevolence, the subj., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a> (as &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, attribute) the obj. The suff. of &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; Schlottm. refers to the female orphan; but Job refers again to the orphan in the following strophe, and the reference to the widow, more natural here on account of the gender, has nothing against it. The choice of the verb (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>) also corresponds to such a reference, since the Hiph. has an intensified Kal-signification here.<p>(Note: &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; and &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;, to remember; &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; and &#1492;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;, to sow, to cover with seed; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, both in the signification silere and fabricari; &#1500;&#1506;&#1490; and &#1492;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1490;, to mock, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-3.htm">Job 21:3</a>; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;, dominari, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-2.htm">Job 25:2</a>; &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; and &#1492;&#1496;&#1492;, to extend, to bow; &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; ;w and &#1492;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; (to obtain by purchase); &#1511;&#1510;&#1512; and &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, to reap, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a>, are all similar. In Arab. the Kal nahaituhu signifies I put him aside by going on one side (nahw or na&#770;hije), the Hiph. anhaituhu, I put him aside by bringing him to the side (comp. &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>).)<p>From earliest youth, so far back as he can remember, he was wont to behave like a father to the orphan, and like a child to the widow. </body></html>
