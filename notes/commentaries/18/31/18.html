He is most large upon this head, because in this matter he was particularly accused. He was tender of all, and hurtful to none. Notice the principles by which Job was restrained from being uncharitable and unmerciful. He stood in awe of the Lord, as certainly against him, if he should wrong the poor. Regard to worldly interests may restrain a man from actual crimes; but the grace of God alone can make him hate, dread, and shun sinful thoughts and desires.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For from my youth he was brought up with me - This verse is usually regarded as a parenthesis, though very various expositions have been given of it. Some have understood it as denying that he had in any way neglected the widow and the fatherless, and affirming that the orphan had always, even from his youth, found a father in him, and the widow a guide. Others, as our translators, suppose that it is a parenthesis thrown in to indicate his general course of life, although the imprecation which he makes on himself, if he had neglected the widow and the orphan, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-22.htm">Job 31:22</a>. Luther reads the two previous verses as questions, and this as an answer to them, and so also do Rosenmuller and Noyes. Umbreit regards this verse as a parenthesis. This is probably to be considered as the correct interpretation, for this better agrees with the Hebrew than the other proposed. It implies a denial of having neglected the widow and the orphan, but the full expression of his abhorrence of a charge of having done so, is to be found in the strong language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-22.htm">Job 31:22</a>. The unusual Hebrew word &#1490;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;  ga&#770;dalniy probably stands for &#1506;&#1502;&#1497; &#1490;&#1491;&#1500;  ga&#770;dal &#8219;imy - "he was brought up with me." This form of the word does not occur elsewhere.<p>As with a father - That is, he always found in me one who treated him as a father. The meaning is, that he had always had under his care those who were orphans; that from his very youth they had been accustomed to look up to him as a father; and that they had never been disappointed in him. It is the language of one who seems to have been born to rank, and who had the means of benefiting others, and who had done it all his life. This accords also with the Oriental notions of kindness - requiring that it should be shown especially to the widow and the fatherless.<p>I have guided her - Margin, "That is, the widow." The meaning is, that he had been her counsellor and friend.<p>From my mother's womb - This cannot be literally true, but it means that he had done it from early life; or as we would say, he had always done it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

We may here, with Wetzstein, compare the like-minded confession in a poem of Muhdi ibn-Muhammel: Arab. ma&#770; nabb klb 'l-ja&#770;r mna&#770; w&#775;la&#770; &#8219;awa&#770;, i.e., "The neighbour's dog never barked (&#1504;&#1489;, Beduin equivalent to &#1504;&#1489;&#1495; in the Syrian towns and villages) on our account (because we have gone by night with an evil design to his tent), and it never howled (being beaten by us, to make it cease its barking lest it should betray us)." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a> follows the punishment which he wishes might overtake him in case he had acted thus: "may my wife grind to another," i.e., may she become his "maid behind the mill," <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2</a>, who must allow herself to be used for everything; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; and a common low woman (comp.

On the other hand, the Targ. (coeat cum alio), lxx (euphemistically &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;, not, as the Syr. Hexapl. shows, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), and Jer. (scortum sit alterius), and in like manner Saad., Gecat., understand &#1514;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;&#1503; directly of carnal surrender; and, in fact, according to the traditional opinion, b. Sota 10a: &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1496;&#1495;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, i.e., "&#1496;&#1495;&#1503; everywhere in Scripture is intended of (carnal) trespass." With reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-13.htm">Lamentations 5:13</a> (where &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;, like Arab. t&#803;ah&#803;u&#770;n, signifies the upper mill-stone, or in gen. the mill), this is certainly incorrect; the parallel, as well as <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, favours this rendering of the word in the obscene sense of &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, molere, in this passage, which also is seen under the Arab. synon. of grinding, Arab. dahaka (trudere); according to which it would have to be interpreted: let her grind to another, i.e., serve him as it were as a nether mill-stone. The verb &#1496;&#1495;&#1503;, used elsewhere (in Talmud.) of the man, would here be transferred to the woman, like as it is used of the mill itself as that which grinds. This rendering is therefore not refuted by its being &#1514;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;&#1503; and not &#1514;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1495;&#1503;. Moreover, the word thus understood is not unworthy of the poet, since he designedly makes Job seize the strongest expressions. Among moderns, &#1514;&#1496;&#1495;&#1503; is thus tropically explained by Ew., Umbr., Hahn, and a few others, but most expositors prefer the proper sense, in connection with which molat certainly, especially with respect to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-9.htm">Job 31:9</a>, is also equivalent to fiat pellex. It is hard to decide; nevertheless the preponderance of reasons seems to us to be on the side of the traditional tropical rendering, by the side of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a> is not attached in progressive, but in synonymous parallelism: et super ea incurvent se alii, &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; of the man, as in the phrase Arab. kr&#8219;t 'l-mra&#770;t 'la&#770; 'l-rjl (curvat se mulier ad virum) of the acquiescence of the woman; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; is a poetical Aramaism, Ew. 177, a. The sin of adultery, in case he had committed it, ought to be punished by another taking possession of his own wife, for that (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; a neutral masc., Keri &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; in accordance with the fem. of the following predicate, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>) is an infamous act, and that (&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; referring back to &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, Keri &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in accordance with the masc. of the following predicate) is a crime for the judges. On this wavering between &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; and &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; vid., Gesenius, Handwrterbuch, 1863, s. v. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, S. 225. &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is the usual Thora-word for the shameless subtle encroachments of sensual desires (vid., Saalschtz, Mosaisches Recht, S. 791f.), and &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; (not &#1506;&#1493;&#1503;), according to the usual view equivalent to crimen et crimen quidem judicum (however, on the form of connection intentionally avoided here, where the genitival relation might easily give an erroneous sense, vid., Ges. 116, rem.), signifies a crime which falls within the province of the penal code, for which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-28.htm">Job 31:28</a> it is less harshly &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;: a judicial, i.e., criminal offence. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is, moreover, not the plur. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; (Kimchi), but of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, an arbitrator (root &#1508;&#1500;, findere, dirimere).<p>The confirmatory clause, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-12.htm">Job 31:12</a>, is co-ordinate with the preceding: for it (this criminal, adulterous enterprise) is a fire, a fire consuming him who allows the sparks of sinful desire to rise up within him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a>.; Sir. 9:8), which devours even to the bottom of the abyss, not resting before it has dragged him whom it has seized down with it into the deepest depth of ruin, and as it were melted him away, and which ought to root out all my produce (all the fruit of my labour).<p>(Note: It is something characteristically Semitic to express the notion of destruction by the figure of burning up with fire [vid. supra, p. 449, note], and it is so much used in the present day as a natural inalienable form of thought, that in curses and imprecations everything, without distinction of the object, is to be burned; e.g., juhrik, may (God) burn up, or juhrak, ought to burn, bila&#770;duh, his native country, bedenuh, his body, &#8219;e&#770;nuh, his eye, shawa&#770;ribuh, his moustache (i.e., his honour), nefesuh, his breath, &#8219;omruh, his life, etc. - Wetzst.)<p>The function of &#1489; is questionable. Ew. (217, f) explains it as local: in my whole revenue, i.e., throughout my whole domain. But it can also be Beth objecti, whether it be that the obj. is conceived as the means of the action (vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4-5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-20.htm">Job 20:20</a>), or that, "corresponding to the Greek genitive, it does not express an entire full coincidence, but an action about and upon the object" (Ew. 217, S. 557). We take it as Beth obj. in the latter sense, after the analogy of the so-called pleonastic Arab. b (e.g., qaraa bi-suwari, he has practised the act of reading upon the Suras of the Koran); and which ought to undertake the act of outrooting upon my whole produce.<p>(Note: On this pleonastic Beth obj. (el-Ba&#770; el-mez&#305;&#770;de) vid., Samachschari's Mufassal, ed. Broch, pp. 125, 132 (according to which it serves "to give intensity and speciality"), and Beidhwi's observation on Sur. ii. 191. The most usual example for it is alqa bi-jedeihi ila et-tahlike, he has plunged his hands, i.e., himself, into ruin. The Ba&#770; el-mega&#770;z (the metaphorical Beth obj.) is similar; it is used where the verb has not its most natural signification but a metaphorical one, e.g., ashada bidhikrihi, he has strengthened his memory: comp. De Sacy, Chrestomathie Arabe, i. 397.) </body></html>
