It kindles the fire of God's wrath, which, if not quenched by the blood of Christ, will consume even to eternal destruction. It consumes the body; it consumes the substance. Burning lusts bring burning judgments. Job had a numerous household, and he managed it well.

The sins which Job had specified before this, were those of the heart; but here he refers to a crime against society - an offence which deserved the interposition of the magistrate. It may be observed here, that adultery has always been regarded as a sin "to be punished by the judges."

Adultery; it is contrary to the light of nature, and is condemned by it as a great sin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-9.htm">Genesis 20:9</a>; as well as contrary to the express will and law of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>; and, though all sin is a transgression of the law of God, and deserving of death; yet there are some sins greater and more heinous than others, being attended with aggravating circumstances; and such is this sin, it is a breach of the marriage contract and covenant between man and wife; it is doing injury to a man's property, and to that which is the nearest and dearest to him, and is what introduces confusion into families, kingdoms, and states; and therefore it follows: <p>yea, it is an iniquity to he punished by the judges; who might take cognizance of it, examine into it, and pass sentence for it, and execute it; and, if they neglect do their duty, God, the Judge of all the earth, will punish for it in the world to come, unless repented of: "for whoremongers and adulterers God will judge", <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>; the punishment of adultery was death by the law of God, and that by stoning, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; and it is remarkable, that the Heathens, who were ignorant of this law, enjoined the same punishment for it; so Homer (e) introduces Hector reproving Paris for this sin, and suggests to him, that if he had his deserved punishment, he would have been clothed with a "stone coat", as he beautifully expresses it; which Suidas (f) explains, by being overwhelmed with stones, or stoned; as Eustathius (g). <p>(e) Iliad. 3. v. 57.

The crime of adultery subverts the family relation, on which it has pleased God to erect the entire fabric of human society. Hence, in the Jewish Law, adultery was made a capital offence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>), both in the woman and in the man. Among other nations the adulteress was commonly punished with death, but the adulterer escaped scot-free. In modern communities adultery is mostly regarded, not as a crime, but as a civil wrong, on account of which an action lies against the adulterer. <span class="cmt_word">It is an iniquity to be punished by the judges</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it is an iniquity of judges</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of which judges take cognizance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  5  If I had intercourse with falsehood,<p>And my foot hastened after deceit:<p>  6  Let Him weigh me in the balances of justice,<p>And let Eloah know my innocence.<p>  7  If my steps turned aside from the way,<p>And my heart followed mine eyes,<p>And any spot hath cleaved to my hands:<p>  8  May I sow and another eat,<p>And let my shoots be rooted out.<p>We have translated &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; (on the form vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>, and the idea on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11</a>) falsehood, for it signifies desolateness and hollowness under a concealing mask, therefore the contradiction between what is without and within, lying and deceit, parall. &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, deceit, delusion, imposition. The phrase &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; is based on the personification of deceit, or on thinking of it in connection with the &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11</a>).
