He understood the spiritual nature of God's commandments, as reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is best to let our actions speak for us; but in some cases we owe it to ourselves and to the cause of God, solemnly to protest our innocence of the crimes of which we are falsely accused. The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are two fatal rocks on which multitudes split; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard. And God takes more exact notice of us than we do of ourselves; let us therefore walk circumspectly. He carefully avoided all sinful means of getting wealth. He dreaded all forbidden profit as much as all forbidden pleasure. What we have in the world may be used with comfort, or lost with comfort, if honestly gotten. Without strict honestly and faithfulness in all our dealings, we can have no good evidence of true godliness. Yet how many professors are unable to abide this touchstone!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is not destruction to the wicked? - That is, Job says that he was well aware that destruction would overtake the wicked, and that if he had given indulgence to impure desires he could have looked for nothing else. Well knowing this, he says, he had guarded himself in the most careful manner from sin, and had labored with the greatest assiduity to keep his eyes and his heart pure.<p>And a strange punishment -  - &#1493;&#1504;&#1499;&#1512;  weneker. The word used here, means literally strangeness - a strange thing, something with which we were unacquainted. It is used here evidently in the sense of a strange or unusual punishment; something which does not occur in the ordinary course of events. The sense is, that for the sin here particularly referred to, God would interpose to inflict vengeance in a manner such as did not occur in the ordinary dealings of his providence. There would be some punishment adopted especially to this sin, and which would mark it with his special displeasure. Has it not been so in all ages? The Vulgate renders it, alienatio, and the Septuagint translates it in a similar manner - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  apallotrio&#772;sis - and they seem to have understood it as followed by entire alienation from God; an idea which would be every where sustained by a reference to the history of the sin referred to by Job. There is no sin that so much poisons all the fountains of pure feeling in the soul, and none that will so certainly terminate in the entire wreck of character. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Arab. qd&#817;d&#817;r, conspurcare vestem); to understand it of the dirty-black skin as quasi sordida veste (Welte) is inadmissible, since this distortion of the skin which Job bewails in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-30.htm">Job 30:30</a> would hardly be spoken of thus tautologically. &#1511;&#1491;&#1512; therefore means in the black of the &#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, or mourning-linen, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>, by which, however, also the interpretation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, "without sunburn" (Ew., Hirz.), which has gained ground since Raschi's day (&#1500;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1494;&#1508;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;), is disposed of; for "one can perhaps say of the blackness of the skin that it does not proceed from the sun, but not of the blackness of mourning attire" (Hahn). &#1511;&#1491;&#1512; also refutes the reading &#1489;&#1500;&#1488; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in lxx Complut.

Bereft of all his possessions, and finally also of his children, he wanders about in mourning (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a>), and even the sun had clothed itself in black to him (which is what &#1511;&#1491;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; means, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a> and freq.); the celestial light, which otherwise brightened his path, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>, was become invisible. We must not forget that Job here reviews the whole chain of afflictions which have come upon him, so that by <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a> we have not to think exclusively, and also not prominently, of the leprosy, since &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497; indeed represents him as still able to move about freely.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a> the accentuation wavers between Dech, Munach, Silluk, according to which &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; belong together, which is favoured by the Dagesh in the Beth, and Tarcha, Munach, Silluk, according to which (because Munach, according to Psalter ii. 503, 2, is a transformation of Rebia mugrasch) &#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; belong together. The latter mode of accentuation, according to which &#1489;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500; must be written without the Dag. instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500; (vid., Norzi), is the only correct one (because Dech cannot come in the last member of the sentence before Silluk), and is also more pleasing as to matter: I rose (and stood) in the assembly, crying for help, or more generally: wailing. The assembly is not to be thought of as an assembly of the people, or even tribunal (Ew.: "before the tribunal seeking a judge, with lamentations"), but as the public; for the thought that Job sought help against his unmerited sufferings before a human tribunal is absurd; and, moreover, the thought that he cried for help before an assembly of the people called together to take counsel and pronounce decisions is equally absurd. Welte, however, who interprets: I was as one who, before an assembled tribunal, etc., introduces a quasi of which there is no trace in the text. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; must therefore, without pressing it further, be taken in the sense of publice, before all the world (Hirz.: comp. &#1489;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-26.htm">Proverbs 26:26</a>); &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, however, is a circumstantial clause declaring the purpose (Ew. 337, b; comp. De Sacy, Gramm. Arabe ii. 357), as is frequently the case after &#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-8.htm">Job 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-14.htm">Psalm 102:14</a> : surrexi in publico ut lamentarer, or lamentaturus, or lamentando. In this lament, extorted by the most intense pain, which he cannot hold back, however many may surround him, he is become a brother of those &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, jackals (canes aurei), whose dolorous howling produces dejection and shuddering in all who hear it, and a companion of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, whose shrill cry is varied by wailing tones of deep melancholy.<p>(Note: It is worth while to cite a passage from Shaw's Travels in Barbary, ii. 348 (transl.), here: "When the ostriches are running and fighting, they sometimes make a wild, hideous, hissing noise with their throats distended and beaks open; at another time, if they meet with a slight opposition, they have a clucking or cackling voice like our domestic fowls: they seem to rejoice and laugh at the terror of their adversary. During the loneliness of the night however, as if their voice had a totally different tone, they often set up a dolorous, hideous moan, which at one time resembles the roar of the lion, and at another is more like the hoarser voice of other quadrupeds, especially the bull and cow. I have often heard them groan as if they were in the greatest agonies." In General Doumas' book on the Horse of the Sahara, I have read that the male ostrich (del&#305;&#770;m), when it is killed, especially if its young ones are near, sends forth a dolorous note, wile the female (remda), on the other hand, does not utter a sound; and so, when the ostrich digs out its nest, one hears a languishing and dolorous tone all day long, and when it has laid its egg, its usual cry is again heard, only about three o'clock in the afternoon.)<p>The point of comparison is not the insensibility of the hearers (Sforno), but the fellowship of wailing and howling together with the accompanying idea of the desert in which it is heard, which is connected with the idea itself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>).</body></html>
