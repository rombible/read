Notice the principles by which Job was restrained from being uncharitable and unmerciful. He stood in awe of the Lord, as certainly against him, if he should wrong the poor.

Though he feared not men, they being at his beck and command, ready to do any thing for him he should order, yet he feared God; and the dread of his resentment, and of destruction from him the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy, had such an influence on him as to deter and keep him from all unkindness to the poor, and in justice to the fatherless; he dreaded the destruction of himself, his family, and substance in this world, and everlasting destruction of soul and body in the world to come; which of all things is to be feared, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>; and Old Testament saints were much under a spirit of bondage to fear, and were actuated thereby; and, though Job might not be under any dread of eternal damnation, knowing his interest in the living Redeemer; yet he might fear temporal destruction, as it is certain he did; which thing he feared came upon him, though not for any crime or crimes he was guilty of, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-25.htm">Job 30:25</a>; he might fear, as a good man may, the chastisements and corrections of his heavenly Father: <p>and by reason of his highness I could not endure; God is higher than the highest angels, or men; he is above all gods, so called; he is God over all, blessed for ever; and such is his height, his glory, and his majesty, that it is terrible, and the dread of them makes men afraid; nor can any sinner stand before him, nor withstand him, nor hope to prevail against him, nor flee from his presence, nor escape out of his hand, nor bear his wrath and indignation, and the coming down of his arm; for what hands can be strong, or heart endure, when the almighty God deals with them? or Job's sense may be, that such an awe of the divine Being was always upon him, that he could not do any unkind thing to the poor, or unjust one to the fatherless. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For destruction <i>from</i> God <i>was</i> a <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</span><p>(q) I did not refrain from sin for fear of men, but because I feared God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">highness I could not endure</span>] Or, <span class="bld">majesty I was powerless</span>, lit. <span class="ital">I was unable</span>.

On &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>; it signifies solicitude (what is ardently desired) and business, here the former: what is ever the interest and want of the poor (the reduced or those without means). From such like things he does not keep the poor back, i.e., does not refuse them; and the eyes of the widow he did not cause or allow to languish (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, to bring to an end, i.e., cause to languish, of the eyes, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-33.htm">1 Samuel 2:33</a>); he let not their longing for assistance be consumed of itself, let not the fountain of their tears become dry without effect. If he had done the opposite, if he had eaten his bread (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;) alone, and not allowed the orphan to eat of it with him - but no, he had not acted thus; on the contrary (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a> and frequently), he (the parentless one) grew up to him (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;, Ges. 121, 4, according to Ew. 315, b, "by the interweaving of the dialects of the people into the ancient form of the declining language;" perhaps it is more correct to say it is by virtue of a poetic, forced, and rare brevity of expression) as to a father ( equals  &#1500;&#1488;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;), and from his mother's womb he guided her, the helpless and defenceless widow, like a faithful child leading its sick or aged mother. The hyperbolical expression &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; dates this sympathizing and active charity back to the very beginning of Job's life. He means to say that it is in-born to him, and he has exercised it ever since he was first able to do so. The brevity of the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;, brief to incorrectness, might be removed by the pointing &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; (Olsh.): from my youth up he (the fatherless one) honoured me as a father; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; (instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; would be explained by the consideration, that a veneration is meant that attributed a dignity which exceed his age to the &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; who was not yet old enough to be a father. But &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; signifies "to cause to grow" in such a connection elsewhere (parall. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, to raise), wherefore lxx translates &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;); and &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; has similar examples of the construction of intransitives with the acc. instead of the dat. (especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>) in its favour: they became me great, i.e., became great in respect of me. Other ways of getting over the difficulty are hardly worth mentioning: the Syriac version reads &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; (pain) and &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;; Raschi makes <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>, the idea of benevolence, the subj., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a> (as &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, attribute) the obj. The suff. of &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; Schlottm. refers to the female orphan; but Job refers again to the orphan in the following strophe, and the reference to the widow, more natural here on account of the gender, has nothing against it. The choice of the verb (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>) also corresponds to such a reference, since the Hiph. has an intensified Kal-signification here.<p>(Note: &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; and &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;, to remember; &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; and &#1492;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;, to sow, to cover with seed; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, both in the signification silere and fabricari; &#1500;&#1506;&#1490; and &#1492;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1490;, to mock, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-3.htm">Job 21:3</a>; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;, dominari, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-2.htm">Job 25:2</a>; &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; and &#1492;&#1496;&#1492;, to extend, to bow; &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; ;w and &#1492;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; (to obtain by purchase); &#1511;&#1510;&#1512; and &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, to reap, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a>, are all similar. In Arab. the Kal nahaituhu signifies I put him aside by going on one side (nahw or na&#770;hije), the Hiph. anhaituhu, I put him aside by bringing him to the side (comp. &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>).)<p>From earliest youth, so far back as he can remember, he was wont to behave like a father to the orphan, and like a child to the widow. </body></html>
