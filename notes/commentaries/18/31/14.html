Lust is a fire in the soul: those that indulge it, are said to burn. It consumes all that is good there, and lays the conscience waste. It kindles the fire of God's wrath, which, if not quenched by the blood of Christ, will consume even to eternal destruction. It consumes the body; it consumes the substance. Burning lusts bring burning judgments. Job had a numerous household, and he managed it well. He considered that he had a Master in heaven; and as we are undone if God should be severe with us, we ought to be mild and gentle towards all with whom we have to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What then shall I do when God riseth up? - That is, when he rises up to pronounce sentence upon people, or to execute impartial justice.

That is, if he had despised and rejected the cause of his servants, or had neglected, or refused to do them justice; he signifies he should be at the utmost loss to know what to do, what excuse to make, or what to say in his own defence, when God should rise up to defend the cause of the injured; either in a way of Providence in this life, or at the great day of judgment in the world to come, when everything will be brought to account, and masters and servants must stand alike before the judgment seat of God, to receive for the things they have done, whether good or evil: <p>and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? when he makes a visitation among men, either in this world, even in a fatherly way, visits transgressions, and reproves and corrects for them; had he been guilty of ill usage of his servants, he must have silently submitted to such visitations and chastisements, having nothing to say for himself why he should not be thus dealt with; or in the world to come, in the great day of visitation, when God shall make inquisition for sin, and seek it out, and call to an account for it; and should this be produced against him, even contempt of the cause of his servants, he was sensible he could not answer him for it, nor for anyone sin of a thousand, as no man will be able to do; but must be speechless, unless he has a better righteousness than his own to answer for him in that time to come. This is Job's first reason which deterred him from using his servants ill; another follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What then shall I do when <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</span><p>(k) If I had oppressed others, how would I have escaped God's judgment.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">when God riseth up</span>] i. e. to judge, as the expression “visiteth” in the next clause suggests.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then shall I do when God riseth up?</span> Job regards God as the Avenger and Champion of all the oppressed.

Job is before his age in recognizing the substantial equality of the slave with the freeman, which otherwise was scarcely taught by any until the promulgation of the gospel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  5  If I had intercourse with falsehood,<p>And my foot hastened after deceit:<p>  6  Let Him weigh me in the balances of justice,<p>And let Eloah know my innocence.<p>  7  If my steps turned aside from the way,<p>And my heart followed mine eyes,<p>And any spot hath cleaved to my hands:<p>  8  May I sow and another eat,<p>And let my shoots be rooted out.<p>We have translated &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; (on the form vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>, and the idea on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11</a>) falsehood, for it signifies desolateness and hollowness under a concealing mask, therefore the contradiction between what is without and within, lying and deceit, parall. &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, deceit, delusion, imposition. The phrase &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; is based on the personification of deceit, or on thinking of it in connection with the &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11</a>).

Many grammarians (Ges. 72, rem. 9; Olsh. 257, g) explain the Pathach instead of Kametz as arising from the virtual doubling of the guttural (Dagesh forte implicitum), for which, however, no ground exists here; Ewald (232, b) explains it by "the hastening of the tone towards the beginning," which explains nothing, since the retreat of the tone has not this effect anywhere else.
