Lust is a fire in the soul: those that indulge it, are said to burn. It consumes all that is good there, and lays the conscience waste. It kindles the fire of God's wrath, which, if not quenched by the blood of Christ, will consume even to eternal destruction. It consumes the body; it consumes the substance. Burning lusts bring burning judgments. Job had a numerous household, and he managed it well. He considered that he had a Master in heaven; and as we are undone if God should be severe with us, we ought to be mild and gentle towards all with whom we have to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then let my wife grined unto another - Let her be subjected to the deepest humiliation and degradation. Probably Job could not have found language which would have more emphatically expressed his sense of the enormity of this crime, or his perfect consciousness of innocence. The last thing which a man would imprecate on himself, would be that which is specified in this verse. The word "grind" (&#1496;&#1495;&#1503;  t&#803;a&#770;chan) means to crush, to beat small; then to grind, as in a handmill; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-8.htm">Numbers 11:8</a>. This was usually the work of females and slaves; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2</a>. The meaning here is, "Let my wife be the mill-wench to another; be his abject slave, and be treated by him with the deepest indignity." This passage has been understood by many in a different sense, which the parallelism might seem to demand, but which is not necessarily the true interpretation. The sense referred to is this: Cogatur uxor mea ad patiendum alius concubitum, ut verbum molendi hoc loco eodem sensu sumatur, quo non raro a Latinis usurpatur ut in illo Horatii (Satyr. L. i. Ecl. ii. verse 35), alienas permolere uxores.<p>In this sense the rabbinic writers understand <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-13.htm">Lamentations 5:13</a>. So also the Chaldee renders the phrase before us (&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;&#1503; &#1514;&#1513;&#1502;&#1513;&#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1497;) coeat cure alio uxor mea; and so the Septuagint seems to have understood it - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;  aresai ara kai he&#772; gune&#772; mou hetero&#772;. But probably Job meant merely that his wife should be reduced to the condition of servitude, and be compelled to labor in the employ of another. We may find here an answer to the opinion of Prof. Lee (in his notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>), that the wife of Job was at this time dead, and that he was meditating the question about marrying again. May we not here also find an instance of the fidelity and forgiving spirit of Job toward a wife who is represented in the early part of this book as manifesting few qualities which could win the heart of an husband? There is no expression of impatience at her temper and her words on the part of Job, and he here speaks of it as the most serious of all calamities that could happen; the most painful of all punishments, that that same wife should be reduced to a condition of servitude and degradation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. grind&#8212;turn the handmill.

Which some understand literally, of her being put to the worst of drudgery and slavery, to work at a mill, and grind corn for the service of a stranger, and be exposed to the company of the meanest of persons, and to their insults and abuses; as we find such as were taken captives and made prisoners by an enemy were put unto, as Samson, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>; and it may be observed, that to grind in a mill was also the work of women, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a>; as it was in early times; Homer (c) speaks of it as in times before him; but others take the words in a figurative sense, as if he imprecated that she lie with another man, and be defiled by him, as the Targum, Aben Ezra, and others (d); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; and in like manner the following clause: <p>and let others bow down upon her; both which phrases are euphemisms, or clean and decent expressions, signifying what otherwise is not to be named; the Scriptures hereby directing, as to avoid unchaste thoughts, inclinations, and desires, and impure actions, so obscene words and filthy talking, as becometh saints: but there is some difficulty in Job's imprecating or wishing such a thing might befall his wife; it could not be lawful, if he had sinned, to wish his wife might sin also; or, if he was an adulterer, that she should be an adulteress; the sense is not, that Job really wished such a thing; but he uses such a way of speaking, to show how remote he was from the sin of uncleanness, there being nothing more disagreeable to a man than for his wife to defile his bed; it is the last thing he would wish for: and moreover Job suggests hereby, that had he been guilty of this sin, he must own and acknowledge that he would be righteously served, and it would be a just retaliation upon him, should his wife use him, or she be used, in such a manner; likewise, though a man may not wish nor commit a sin for the punishment of another; yet God sometimes punishes sin with sin, and even with the same kind of sin, and with this; so David's sin with Bathsheba was punished with Absalom lying with his wives and concubines before the sun, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>. <p>(c) Odyss. 7. v. 107. &amp; Odyss. 20. v. 109.

Job is not an Israelite, he is without the pale of the positive, Sinaitic revelation; his religion is the old patriarchal religion, which even in the present day is called d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m (the religion of Abraham), or d&#305;&#770;n el-bedu (the religion of the steppe) as the religion of those Arabs who are not Moslem, or at least influenced by the penetrating Islamism, and is called by Meja&#770;n&#305;&#770;sh&#305;&#770; el-han&#305;&#770;f&#305;&#770;je (vid., supra, p. 362, note) as the patriarchally orthodox religion.<p>(Note: Also in the Merg district east of Damascus, which is peopled by an ancient unmixed race, because the fever which prevails there kills strangers, remnants of the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m have been preserved despite the penetrating Islamism. There the mulaqqin (Souffleur), who says the creed into the grave as a farewell to the buried one, adds the following words: "The muslim is my brother, the muslima my sister, Abraham is my father (ab&#305;&#770;), his religion (d&#305;&#770;nuh) is mine, and his confession (medhebuh) mine." It is indisputable that the words muslim (one who is submissive to God) and islm (submission to God) have originally belonged to the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m. It is also remarkable that the Moslem salutation sela&#770;m occurs only as a sign in war among the wandering tribes, and that the guest parts from his host with the words: da&#770;ima&#770; besa&#770;t el-Chal&#305;&#770;l&#770; la&#770; maqtu&#770;&#8219; wala&#770; memnu&#770;&#8219;, i.e., mayest thou always have Abraham's table, and plenty of provisions and guests. - Wetzst.)<p>As little as this religion, even in the present day, is acquainted with the specific Mohammedan commandments, so little knew Job of the specifically Israelitish. On the contrary, his confession, which he lays down in this third monologue, coincides remarkably with the ten commandments of piety (el-fela&#770;h) peculiar to the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m, although it differs in this respect, that it does not give the prominence to submission to the dispensations of God, that tesl&#305;&#770;m which, as the whole of this didactic poem teaches by its issue, is the duty of the perfectly pious; also bravery in defence of holy property and rights is wanting, which among the wandering tribes is accounted as an essential part of the hebbet er-r&#305;&#770;h (inspiration of the Divine Being), i.e., active piety, and to which it is similarly related, as to the binding notion of "honour" which was coined by the western chivalry of the middle ages.<p>Job begins with the duty of chastity. Consistently with the prologue, which the drama itself nowhere belies, he is living in monogamy, as at the present day the orthodox Arabs, averse to Islamism, are not addicted to Moslem polygamy. With the confession of having maintained this marriage (although, to infer from the prologue, it was not an over-happy, deeply sympathetic one) sacred, and restrained himself not only from every adulterous act, but also from adulterous desires, his confessions begin. Here, in the middle of the Old Testament, without the pale of the Old Testament &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, we meet just that moral strictness and depth with which the Preacher on the mount, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27</a>., opposes the spirit to the letter of the seventh commandment. It is &#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, designedly; &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1514; is the usual phrase where two equals are concerned; on the contrary, &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500; where two the superior - Jehovah, or a king, or conqueror - binds himself to another under prescribed conditions, or the covenant is made not so much by a mutual advance as by the one taking the initiative. In this latter case, the secondary notions of a promise given (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>), or even, as here, of a law prescribed, are combined with &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;: "as lord of my senses I prescribed this law for my eyes" (Ew.). The eyes, says a Talmudic proverb, are the procuresses of sin (&#1505;&#1512;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1492; &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;); "to close his eyes, that they may not feast on evil," is, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>, a clearly defined line in the picture of him on whom the everlasting burnings can have no hold. The exclamation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>, is spoken with self-conscious indignation: Why should I... (comp.
