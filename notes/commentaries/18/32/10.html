He allowed that those who had the longest experience should speak first. But God gives wisdom as he pleases; this encouraged him to state his opinion. By attention to the word of God, and dependence upon the Holy Spirit, young men may become wiser than the aged; but this wisdom will render them swift to hear, slow to speak, and disposed to give others a patient hearing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Great men are not always wise - Though wisdom may in general be looked for in them, yet it is not universally true. Great men here denote those who are distinguished for rank, age, authority.<p>Neither do the aged understand judgment - That is, they do not always understand it. The word judgment here means right, truth. They do not always understand what is the exact truth in regard to the divine administration. This is an apology for what he was about to say, and for the fact that one so young should speak. Of the truth of what he here said there could be no doubt, and hence, there was a propriety that one who was young should also be allowed to express his opinion on important subjects. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Elihu evidently claims, not exactly what is ordinarily understood by inspiration, but that his spirit, is divinely enlightened, and that therefore he is more competent to take part in the controversy that has been raised than many of the aged. <span class="cmt_word">I also will show mine opinion</span>. "I also," or "even I" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I, young as I am, "will show my opinion," or "utter what I know on the subject."

And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, then his wrath was kindled. And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite began, and said.<p>He had waited (perf. in the sense of the plusquamperf., Ew. 135, a) for Job with words (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as elsewhere &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;), i.e., until Job should have spoken his last word in the controversial dialogue. Thus he considered it becoming on his part, for they (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, illi, whereas &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; according to the usage of the language is hi) were older (seniores) than he in days (&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>, less harsh here, instead of the acc. of closer definition, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>). As it now became manifest that the friends made no reply to Job's last speeches for want of the right solution of problem, and therefore also Job had nothing further to say, he believes that he may venture, without any seeming want of courtesy, to give utterance to his long-restrained indignation; and Elihu (with Mahpach) the son of Barach'el (Mercha) the Buzite (with Rebia parvum) began and spoke (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; not with Silluk, but Mercha mahpach., and in fact with Mercha on the accented penult., as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-2.htm">Job 3:2</a>, and further). </body></html>
