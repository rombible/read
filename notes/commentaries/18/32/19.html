The repherence is to a bottle, in which there is no opening, or no vent phor the phermenting wine to work itselph ophph. It is usual to leave a small hole in barrels and casks when wine, cider, or beer is phermenting. This is necessary in order to prevent the cask phrom bursting. Elihu compares himselph to a bottle in which new wine bad been put, and where there was no vent phor it, and when in consequence it was ready to burst. That new wine is here intended is apparent phrom the connection, and has been so understood by the ancient versions. So Jerome renders it, Mustum, must, or new wine. The Septuagint, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  askos gleukous zeo&#772;n dedemenos - "a bottle filled with sweet wine, fermenting, bound;" that is, which has no vent.<p>It is ready to burst like new bottles - The Septuagint renders this, "As the torn (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2;  erre&#772;go&#772;s) bellows of a smith." Why this version was adopted. it is not easy to say. The comparison would be pertinent, but the version could not be made from the present Hebrew text. It is possible that the copy of the Hebrew text which the Septuagint had may have read: &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; - "artificers," instead of: &#1492;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; - new, and then the meaning would be, "as the bottles, or skins of artificers;" that is, as their bellows, which were doubtless at first merely the skins of animals. The reference of Elihu, however, is undoubtedly to skins that were used as bottles, and new skins are mentioned here as ready to burst, not because they were more likely to burst than old ones - for that was by no means the case - but because new and unfermented wine would naturally be placed in them, thus endangering them. Bottles in the east, it is well known, are usually made of the skins of goats; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>.<p>The process of manufacturing them at present is this: The skins of the goats are striped off whole except at the neck. The holes at the feet and tail are sewed up. They are first stuffed out full, and strained by driving in small billets and chips of oak wood; and then are filled with a strong infusion of oak bark for a certain time, until the hair becomes fixed, and the skin sufficiently tanned. They are sold at different prices, from fifteen up to fifty piastres. Robinson's Bibli. Research. ii. 440. Elihu, perhaps, could not have found a more striking illustration of his meaning. lie could no longer restrain himself, and he gave utterance, therefore, to the views which he deemed so important. The word "belly" in this verse (&#1489;&#1496;&#1503;  bet&#803;en) is rendered by Umbreit and Noyes, bosom. It not improbably has this meaning and the reference is to the fact that in the East the words are uttered forth much more ab imo pectore, or are much more guttural than with us. The voice seems to come from the lower part of the throat, or from the bosom, in a manner which the people of Western nations find it difficult to imitate. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. belly&#8212;bosom: from which the words of Orientalists in speaking seem to come more than with us; they speak gutturally. "Like (new) wine (in fermentation) without a vent," to work itself off. New wine is kept in new goatskin bottles. This fittingly applies to the young Elihu, as contrasted with the old friends (Mt 9:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My belly, </span> i.e. my mind or heart, which is oft called a man’s belly, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm" title="They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepares deceit.">Job 15:35</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm" title="I delight to do your will, O my God: yes, your law is within my heart.">Psalm 40:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-16.htm" title="When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he comes up to the people, he will invade them with his troops.">Habakkuk 3:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm" title="He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.">John 7:38</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As wine; </span> as new wine pent up close in a bottle, as the following words explain it and determine it.

Or, "is not opened" (a), like a bottle of wine, as Ben Gersom, which is stopped close, and the wine in it new; which is most apt to ferment, and should have vent given it; so the Targum, <p>"as new wine, which is not opened:'' <p>in the same manner Jarchi and Bar Tzemach interpret it; in these words Elihu illustrates, by a metaphor taken from new wine put into bottles and tightly stopped, what he had before more literally and properly expressed, and so in the following clause: <p>it is ready to burst like new bottles; or perhaps it may be better rendered, "like bottles of new wine" (b); for new bottles are not so apt to burst as old ones, and especially when they have new wine in them; the bottles of the ancients, and in the eastern countries, being made of skin, which better agrees with what our Lord says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>; by his belly he means his mind, which was full of matter, and that matter he compares to new wine in bottles, tightly stopped, which need vent, and are in danger of bursting: the doctrine of the Gospel is like to wine, Sol 7:9; to wine neat and clean, being free from all human mixtures; to wine of a good flavour and pleasant taste, as the Gospel is to those whose taste is changed; to generous wine, which revives, and refreshes, and comforts; all which effects the doctrines of the Gospel have, when attended with a divine influence: and it may be compared to new wine; not that it is a new and upstart doctrine, it is the everlasting Gospel, made known immediately on the fall of Adam, and was ordained before the world for our glory; but because it is newly, or of late, under the Gospel dispensation, more clearly revealed: ministers of the word are like vessels, into which it is put; they are but vessels, even earthly vessels, and have nothing but what is put into them; and they are like vessels stopped up, when they are straitened in themselves, or shut up by the Lord, that they cannot come forth freely in their ministry, and when any outward restraint is laid upon them by persecuting magistrates, and when there is no open door for them in Providence; which gives them great pain and uneasiness, and, let the consequence be what it will, they are weary of forbearing, and cannot stay, but must speak the things they see and know; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>. <p>(a)  "quod non est apertum", Pagninus, Michaelis, Schultens.

The process of fermentation properly takes place in the vat, from which the gas evolved in the operation can freely escape. When wine was put into skins before fermentation was complete, and gas continued to be evolved, the effect was that the skins became distended, as the gas had no vent, and then not unfrequently the skins would burst, especially if they were old ones (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It is ready to burst like new bottles</span>. Even if the skins were new, they would undergo distension, and would appear as if "ready to burst," though the actual catastrophe might be avoided. Elihu's pent-up feelings seem to him, if they do not obtain a vent, to threaten some such a result. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  Behold, I waited upon your words,<p>Hearkened to your perceptions,<p>While ye searched out replies.<p>12  And I attended closely to you,<p>Yet behold: there was no one who refuted Job,<p>Who answered his sentences, from you.<p>13  Lest ye should say: "We found wisdom,<p>God is able to smite him, not man!"<p>14  Now he hath not arranged his words against me,<p>And with your sentences I will not reply to him.<p>He has waited for their words, viz., that they might give utterance to such words as should tend to refute and silence Job.

Every unbiassed reader will have an impression of the remarkable expressions and constructions here, similar to that which one has in passing from the book of the Kings to the characteristic sections of the Chronicles. The three, Elihu goes on to say, shall not indeed think that in Job a wisdom has opposed them - a false wisdom, indeed - which only God and not any man can drive out of the field (&#1504;&#1491;&#1507;, Arab. ndf, discutere, dispellere, as the wind drives away chaff or dry leaves); while he has not, however (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; followed directly by a v. fin. forming a subordinate clause, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-18.htm">Psalm 44:18</a>, and freq., Ew. 341, a), arrayed (&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; in a military sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>; or forensic, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>; or even as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-19.htm">Job 37:19</a>, in the general sense of proponere) words against him (Elihu), i.e., utterances before which he would be compelled to confess himself affected and overcome.
