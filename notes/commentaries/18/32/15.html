God is the God of order, not of confusion. It is great refreshment to a good man, to speak for the glory of the Lord, and to edify others. And the more we consider the majesty of God, as our Maker, and the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less shall we sinfully fear or flatter men. Could we set the wrath Lord always before us, in his mercies and his terrors, we should not be moved from doing our duty in whatever we are called to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They were amazed - There also are the words of Elihu, and are designed to express his astonishment that the three friends of Job did not answer him. He says that they were completely silenced, and he repeats this to call attention to the remarkable fact that men who began so confidently, and who still held on to their opinion, had not one word more to say. There is some reason to suppose, from the change of person here from the second to the third, that Elihu turned from them to those who were present, and called their attention to the fact that the friends of Job were completely silenced. This supposition, however, is not absolutely necessary, for it is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry to change from the second person to the third, especially where there is any censure or rebuke implied; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm">Job 18:4</a>.<p>They left off speaking - Margin, "removed speeches from themselves." The marginal reading accords with the Hebrew. The sense is the same as in the common version, though the Hebrew is more poetic. It is not merely that they ceased to speak, but that they put words at a great distance from them. They could say absolutely nothing. This fact, that they were wholly silent, furnished an ample apology for Elihu to take up the subject. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

They were like persons thunderstruck, quite surprised and astonished to hear a young man talk after this manner: <p>they answered no more; as they had ceased to answer Job, they did not undertake to answer Elihu, who had plainly told them their arguments were not convincing, their answers were no answers, and that they had done a wrong thing in condemning Job without proof; and that which they thought their greatest wisdom, and strongest argument, had no wisdom nor strength in it; namely, which was taken from his sore afflictions by the hand of God: <p>they left off speaking; or words departed from them, as Jarchi; their speech left them, they seemed deprived of it: Mr. Broughton renders the whole, <p>"they shrink away, do speak no more, speeches be departed from them.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">they left off speaking</span>] lit. <span class="ital">words have removed</span>, or, <span class="ital">are gone from them</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm" title="And he removed from there to a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he built an altar to the LORD, and called on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 12:8</a>)—they are reduced to silence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">15–22</span>. Turning from the three friends Elihu seems to speak in soliloquy and present to his own mind the singular situation: the three friends are discomfited before Job and reduced to silence; this should not be; therefore he will express his convictions. His breast is filled with thoughts and emotions that will not be repressed: he must speak, that he may find relief. And he will speak fearlessly and in sincerity, not regarding the person of any man.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">They were amazed, they answered no more</span>. A change from the second to the third person, possibly as seeming less disrespectful.

In contradiction to biblical psychology, Rosenm. and others take <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a> as antithetical: Certainly there is spirit in man, but ... . The two halves of the verse are, on the contrary, a synonymous ("the spirit, it is in man, viz., that is and acts") or progressive parallelism) thus according to the accents: "the spirit, even that which is in man, and ... "). It is the Spirit of God to which man owes his life as a living being, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>; the spirit of man is the principle of life creatively wrought, and indeed breathed into him, by the Spirit of God; so that with regard to the author it can be just as much God's &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; or &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>, as in respect of the possessor: man's &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; or &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;. All man's life, his thinking as well as his bodily life, is effected by this inwrought principle of life which he bears within him, and all true understanding, without being confined to any special age of life, comes solely from this divinely originated and divinely living spirit, so far as he acts according to his divine origin and basis of life. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; are here (as the opposite of &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) grandes  equals  grandaevi (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;). &#1500;&#1488; governs both members of the verse, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-10.htm">Job 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-17.htm">Job 28:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>. Understanding or ability to form a judgment is not limited to old age, but only by our allowing the &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; to rule in us in its connection with the divine. Elihu begs a favourable hearing for that of which he is conscious. &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;, and the Hebr.-Aramaic &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, which likewise belong to his favourite words, recur here. </body></html>
