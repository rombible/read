He allowed that those who had the longest experience should speak first. But God gives wisdom as he pleases; this encouraged him to state his opinion. By attention to the word of God, and dependence upon the Holy Spirit, young men may become wiser than the aged; but this wisdom will render them swift to hear, slow to speak, and disposed to give others a patient hearing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I said, Days should speak - The aged ought to speak. They have had the advantage of long observation of the course of events; they are acquainted with the sentiments of past times; they may have had an opportunity of conversing with distinguished sages, and it is to them that we look up for counsel. This was eminently in accordance with the ancient Oriental views of what is right; and it is a sentiment which accords with what is obviously proper, however little it is regarded in modern times. It is one of the marks of urbanity and true politeness; of the prevalence of good breeding, morals, and piety, and of an advanced state of society, when respect is shown to the sentiments of the aged. They have had the opportunity of long observation. They have conversed much with people. They have seen the results of certain courses of conduct, and they have arrived at a period of life when they can look at the reality of things, and are uninfluenced now by passion. Returning respect for the sentiments of the aged, attention to their counsels, veneration for their persons, and deference for them when they speak, would be an indication of advancement in society in modern times; and there is scarcely anything in which we have deteriorated from the simplicity of the early ages, or in which we fall behind the Oriental world, so much as in the lack of this. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

That is, men of days, of many days, who have lived many days and years in the world: man in common is but of few days, even the most that men arrive to are but few; and some indeed are very few, in comparison of whom others may be said to be men of days, or to have lived many days; and to such it belongs to speak, it is their place, nor should they be prevented or interrupted; it should be allowed them to speak, nor should they be hindered; and it is their duty to speak and instruct juniors, and all that are under them; and it might be reasonably expected, that when they speak it will be to the purpose, and to profit and edification: <p>and multitude of years should teach wisdom; that is, such over whom many have passed; these it may be thought, having had an opportunity of making their observation on things, and of increasing experience, and of treasuring up a stock of knowledge, they should be very capable of, and indeed the only fit persons to teach others wisdom; either natural wisdom, or the knowledge of natural things; or divine wisdom, the knowledge of God, of his perfections and providences; and inward, spiritual, and evangelical wisdom, which lies in the knowledge of a man's self; in the knowledge of God in Christ; in the knowledge of Christ and of the Gospel of Christ, and the truths of it: this was a sentiment Elihu had entertained of ancient men, and this had restrained him from entering sooner into this debate between Job and his friends; they all being his superiors in age, and, as from thence he judged, in wisdom and knowledge also. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I said, Days <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</span><p>(e) Meaning, the ancient, who have experience.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I kept saying to myself, when the desire to interrupt came upon me." <span class="cmt_word">Days should speak</span>.

And the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself at the expense of God. And against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they found no answer, and condemned Job.<p>The name of the speaker is &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (with Mahpach), son of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500; (with Munach) the buwziy (with Zarka). The name Elihu signifies "my God is He," and occurs also as an Israelitish name, although it is not specifically Israelitish, like Elijah (my God is Jehovah). Brach'el (for which the mode of writing &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500; with Dag. implic. is also found) signifies "may God bless!" (Olsh. 277, S. 618); for proper names, as the Arabian grammarians observe, can be formed both into the form of assertory clauses (ichba&#770;r), and also into the form of modal (insha&#770;); the name &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500; is in this respect distinguished from the specifically Israelitish name &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492; (Jehovah blesseth). The accompanying national name defines the scene; for on the one side &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>, are the sons of Nahor, Abraham's brother, who removed with him (though not at the same time) from Ur Casdim to Haran, therefore by family Aramaeans; on the other side, &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>, appears as an Arab race, belonging to the &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497; &#1508;&#1488;&#1492; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>), i.e., to the Arabs proper, who cut the hair of their heads short all round (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;, Herodotus iii. 8), because wearing it long was accounted as disgraceful (vid., Tebrzi in the Hamsa, p. 459, l. 10ff.). Within the Buzite race, Elihu sprang from the family of &#1512;&#1501;. Since &#1512;&#1501; is the name of the family, not the race, it cannot be equivalent to &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; (like &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>,  equals  &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), and it is therefore useless to derive the Aramaic colouring of Elihu's speeches from design on the part of the poet. But by making him a Buzite, he certainly appears to make him an Aramaean Arab, as Aristeas in Euseb. praep. ix. 25 calls him &#x395;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bb; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x396;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; (from &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1510;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;). It is remarkable that Elihu's origin is given so exactly, while the three are described only according to their country, without any statement of father or family. It would indeed be possible, as Lightfoot and Rosenm. suppose, for the poet to conceal his own name in that of Elihu, or to make allusion to it; but an instance of this later custom of Oriental poets is found nowhere else in Old Testament literature.<p>The three friends are silenced, because all their attempts to move Job to a penitent confession that his affliction is the punishment of his sins, have rebounded against this fact, that he was righteous in his own eyes, i.e., that he imagined himself righteous; and because they now (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; of persons, in distinction from &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;, has the secondary notion of involuntariness) know of nothing more to say. Then Elihu's indignation breaks forth in two directions. First, concerning Job, that he justified himself &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., not a Deo (so that He would be obliged to account him righteous, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17</a>), but prae Deo. Elihu rightly does not find it censurable in Job, that as a more commonly self-righteous man he in general does not consider himself a sinner, which the three insinuate of him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-4.htm">Job 25:4</a>), but that, declaring himself to be righteous, he brings upon God the appearance of injustice, or, as Jehovah also says further on, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-8.htm">Job 40:8</a>, that he condemns God in order that he may be able to maintain his own righteousness. Secondly, concerning the three, that they have found no answer by which they might have been able to disarm Job in his maintenance of his own righteousness at the expense of the divine justice, and that in consequence of this they have condemned Job. Hahn translates: so that they should have represented Job as guilty; but that they have not succeeded in stamping the servant of God as a &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, would wrongly excite Elihu's displeasure. And Ewald translates: and that they had nevertheless condemned him (345, a); but even this was not the real main defect of their opposition. The fut. consec. describes the condemnation as the result of their inability to hit upon the right answer; it was a miserable expedient to which they had recourse. According to the Jewish view, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; is one of the eighteen &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (correctiones scribarum), since it should be &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;. But it is not the friends who have been guilty of this sin of &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; against God, but Job, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-8.htm">Job 40:8</a>, to whom Elihu opposes the sentence &#1488;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-12.htm">Job 34:12</a>. Our judgment of another such tiqqu&#770;n, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>, was more favourable. That Elihu, notwithstanding the inward conviction to the contrary by which he is followed during the course of the controversial dialogue, now speaks for the first time, is explained by what follows. </body></html>
