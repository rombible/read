God is the God of order, not of confusion. It is great refreshment to a good man, to speak for the glory of the Lord, and to edify others. And the more we consider the majesty of God, as our Maker, and the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less shall we sinfully fear or flatter men. Could we set the wrath Lord always before us, in his mercies and his terrors, we should not be moved from doing our duty in whatever we are called to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I am full of matter - Margin, as in Hebrew words." The three friends of Job had been silenced. They had not one word more to say. Elihu says that the reverse was true of him. He was full of words, and felt constrained to speak. It was not because he forced himself to do it, nor because he did it as a mere matter of duty, but he was so impressed with the subject that it would be a relief for him to give utterance to his views.<p>The spirit within me - Referring, probably, to the conviction that it was the divine Spirit which urged him to speak; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>. A similar constraint in regard to the necessity of speaking, when under the influence of the Holy Spirit, is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>, "His word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay;" compare Introduction to Isaiah, Section 7. The phrase "within me" is in the margin, as in Hebrew my belly - where the belly is spoken of as the seat of the mind; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>. We speak of the head as the seat of the intellect, and the heart as the seat of the affections. The Hebrews were much in the habit of representing the region of the heart as the seat of all mental operations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

Or "full of words" (y); not of mere words, such that have nothing solid and substantial in them; this is the character of a fool, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:14</a>; nor was Elihu a loquacious talkative man, as Job is charged to be, a man full of talk, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-2.htm">Job 11:2</a>; but he was full of words, which had fulness of matter in them, which were to the purpose, and contained strong reasonings and solid arguments; his mind was full of them, and he could easily fill his mouth with them, and was not easy until he had uttered them: so an able minister of the word may be said to be full of words, of the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus, of useful doctrines, when the word of Christ dwells richly in him, and he has a rich treasure in an earthen vessel, is full of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ; has a large knowledge of Gospel truths, a real experience of them in the heart, great gifts to express them to others, and is full of power and of the Spirit of God to declare them, as this good man was: <p>the spirit within me constraineth me, or "the spirit of my belly" (z); alluding to wind pent up therein, which, unless expelled, gives great uneasiness and pain: he either means the Spirit of God within him, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>, by whom the prophets were inspired and spoke, by whom ordinary ministers of the word are qualified for their work, and by whom they are led into all truth, and who presses and obliges them to speak what they know; there is a necessity upon them to preach the Gospel wholly and faithfully, and a woe unto them if they do not: or else his own spirit, influenced and actuated by the Spirit of God; as the spirit of the Apostle Paul was stirred up in him to speak, when he saw the idolatry and superstition of the people of Athens, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-16.htm">Acts 17:16</a>; so love to God and Christ, and the souls of men, the honour of God, and interest of religion, constrain the ministers of Christ to speak in his name, notwithstanding all the opposition made unto them, and reproach cast upon them. <p>(y)  "plenus sum sermonibus", V.

Elihu feels a crowd of thoughts and arguments fermenting in his bosom and pressing for utterance with a force not to be resisted. The word “belly” corresponds to the English “breast” or bosom. What stirs the spirit of Elihu is not only his eagerness to express his convictions on the question, but also indignation at the retreat and silence of the three friends.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I am full of matter</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I am full</span> of words; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have very much to say. <span class="cmt_word">The spirit within me constraineth me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the spirit of my belly</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my inward feelings and emotions."

In what follows, &#1506;&#1491; still more emphatically than &#1500; refers this aim to that to which Elihu had paid great attention: I hearkened to your understandings, i.e., explanations of the matter, that, or whether, they came forth, (I hearkened) to see if you searched or found out words, i.e., appropriate words. Such abbreviated forms as &#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;  equals  &#1488;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; (comp. &#1502;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; for &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-4.htm">Proverbs 17:4</a>, Ges. 68, rem. 1, if it does not signify nutriens, from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;) we shall frequently meet with in this Elihu section. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a> evidently is related as an antecedent to what follows: and I paid attention to you (&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; contrary to the analogy of the cognate praep. instead of &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, moreover for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, with the accompanying notion: intently, or, according to Aben-Duran: thoroughly, without allowing a word to escape me), and behold, intently as I paid attention: no one came forward to refute Job; there was no one from or among you who answered (met successfully) his assertions. Every unbiassed reader will have an impression of the remarkable expressions and constructions here, similar to that which one has in passing from the book of the Kings to the characteristic sections of the Chronicles. The three, Elihu goes on to say, shall not indeed think that in Job a wisdom has opposed them - a false wisdom, indeed - which only God and not any man can drive out of the field (&#1504;&#1491;&#1507;, Arab. ndf, discutere, dispellere, as the wind drives away chaff or dry leaves); while he has not, however (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; followed directly by a v. fin. forming a subordinate clause, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-18.htm">Psalm 44:18</a>, and freq., Ew. 341, a), arrayed (&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; in a military sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>; or forensic, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>; or even as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-19.htm">Job 37:19</a>, in the general sense of proponere) words against him (Elihu), i.e., utterances before which he would be compelled to confess himself affected and overcome. He will not then also answer him with such opinions as those so frequently repeated by them, i.e., he will take a totally different course from theirs in order to refute him. </body></html>
