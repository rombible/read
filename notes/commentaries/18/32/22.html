Some commentators regard Elihu’s character with great disfavour, and consider him to be an empty and arrogant talker, mainly, perhaps, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/32-18.htm" title="For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constrains me.">Job 32:18-19</a>; others accept him as a wise and pious friend of Job, who not only gave him good advice, but perhaps more nearly than any other of the disputants hit the truth about Job’s afflictions. We are probably more right in this latter view, because at the climax of the poem we do not read that Elihu had any share in the condemnation which was passed by God on the three friends of Job. He is not noticed for either praise or blame.<p>It is to be observed that the last eight verses of this chapter are a kind of soliloquy, unlike the former part of it, which was addressed to the friends, or the next chapter, which is addressed to Job.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:15-22 If we are sure that the Spirit of God suggested what we are about to say, still we ought to refrain, till it comes to our turn to speak. God is the God of order, not of confusion. It is great refreshment to a good man, to speak for the glory of the Lord, and to edify others. And the more we consider the majesty of God, as our Maker, and the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less shall we sinfully fear or flatter men. Could we set the wrath Lord always before us, in his mercies and his terrors, we should not be moved from doing our duty in whatever we are called to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I know not to give flattering titles - I do not know how to flatter. It is not in my character; it has not been my habit. "In so doing." These words are not in the Hebrew, and they greatly mar the sense, and give a different idea from that which was intended by the speaker.<p>My Maker would soon take me away - Or, rather, "My Maker will soon take me away." That is, "I know that I must soon be removed, and must stand before my Maker. I must give an account for all that I say. Knowing that I am to go to the realities of another state of being, I cannot flatter people. I must tell them the exact and simple truth." There could be no better preventive of flattery than this. The conviction that we are soon to appear before God, where all are on a level, and where every mask will be stripped off, and everything appear as it is, would prevent us from ascribing to others qualities which we know they do not possess, and from giving them titles which will only exalt them in their own estimation, and hide the truth from their minds. Titles which properly belong to men, and which pertain to office, religion does not forbid us to confer - for the welfare of the community is promoted by a proper respect for the names and offices of those who rule. But no good end is answered in ascribing to men titles as mere matters of distinction, which serve to keep before them the idea of their own talents or importance; or which lead them to forget that they like others are soon to be "taken away," and called to give up their account in another world. The deep conviction that we are all soon to try the realities of a bed of death and of the grave, and that we are to go to a world where there is no delusion, and where the ascription of qualities to us here which do not belong to us will be of no avail, would prompt to a wish to state always the simple truth. Under that conviction, we should never so ascribe to another any quality of beauty, strength, or talent, any name or title, as to leave him for one moment under a deception about himself. If this rule were followed, what a change would it produce in the social, the political, the literary, and even the religious world! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. take me away&#8212;as a punishment (Ps 102:24).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I have neither skill nor will to flatter Job or any man so as to debauch my conscience, or corrupt the truth, or speak falsely for his sake.

He had not been brought up in such a manner, nor taught to use them; he had not been inured to them, nor did he know or approve of them; nor could he in conscience give them; <p>in so doing, my Maker would soon take me away; it being such a piece of wickedness, so abominable to him, and so highly resented by him, that I might justly expect he would, as he could, strike me dead at once; just as Ananias and Sapphira were struck dead for lying, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/5-5.htm">Acts 5:5</a>, or he knew that it would be but a short time at most, and he should be taken out of the world by death, when he must appear before his Maker, his Judge, to whom he must give an account of his words, as well as actions; the awe of this being continually on his mind would not admit him to flatter any man. Some render it, "will burn me" (c), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-21.htm">2 Samuel 5:21</a>; so Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom, that is, in hell fire; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>. <p>(c) "comburet me", Pagninus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I know not to give flattering <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> titles; <i>in so doing</i> my maker would soon take me away.</span><p>(n) The Hebrew word signifies to change the name as to call a fool a wise man: meaning, that he would not cloak the truth to flatter men.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. Elihu is conscious of sincerity; it is not in his nature to flatter. His fear of God also and sense of His rectitude would deter him from such a thing; comp. Job’s language, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-7.htm" title="Will you speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?">Job 13:7</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These last words and many other things which Elihu says enable us to judge rightly of the part which the author intends him to play. There are some things in his manner of introducing himself and in the way in which he speaks of his own arguments, which seem to offend against modesty and almost shock our sense of decorum. We must not, however, apply Western standards of taste to the East. There was nothing further from the intention of the author of these Chapters than to make Elihu play a ridiculous part. This speaker is meant to offer what the writer judged a weighty contribution to the discussion, and to the vindication of the ways of God to man. It is just this fact, however, that Elihu is a serious speaker and yet so characterized by mannerisms that raises the question whether the author of such a character possessed the severe taste and high dramatic genius which so conspicuously belong to the author of the other characters; in other words, the question whether these chapters are not the composition of a different writer (see the Introduction).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I know not to give flattering titles</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is not my habit to give flattering titles, nor have I any knowledge of the art. <span class="cmt_word">I should expect that, if such were my habit, my Maker would soon take me away</span>; would soon, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, remove me from the earth, as one whose influence was not for good, but for evil.

Most expositors render &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; passively, according to the sense: they have removed from them, i.e., are removed from them; but why may &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1511; not signify, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>, to move away, viz., the tent  equals  to wander on (Schlottm.)? The figure: words are moved away (as it were according to an encampment broken up) from them, i.e., as we say: they have left them, is quite in accordance with the figurative style of this section. It is unnecessary to take &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-16.htm">Job 32:16</a>, with Ew. (342, c) 2 and Hirz. as perf. consec. and interrogative: and should I wait, because they speak no more? Certainly the interrog. part. sometimes disappears after the Waw of consequence, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-13.htm">Ezekiel 18:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24</a> (and will he live?); but by what would &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; be distinguished as perf. consec. here? Hahn's interpretation: I have waited, until they do not speak, for they stand ... , also does not commend itself; the poet would have expressed this by &#1506;&#1491; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;, while the two &#1499;&#1497;, especially with the poet's predilection for repetition, appear to be co-ordinate. Elihu means to say that he has waited a long time, surprised that the three did not speak further, and that they stand still without speaking again. Therefore he thinks the time is come for him also to answer Job. &#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; cannot be fut. Kal, since where the 1 fut. Kal and Hiph. cannot be distinguished by the vowel within the word (as in the Ayin Awa and double Ayin verbs), the former has an inalienable Segol; it is therefore 1 fut. Hiph., but not as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:19</a> in the signification to employ labour upon anything (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;), but in an intensive Kal signification (as &#1492;&#1494;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511; for &#1494;&#1506;&#1511;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-9.htm">Job 35:9</a>, comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>): to answer, to give any one an answer when called upon. Ewald's supposedly proverbial: I also plough my field! (192, c, Anm. 2) does unnecessary violence to the usage of the language, which is unacquainted with this &#1492;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, to plough. It is perfectly consistent with Elihu's diction, that &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1497; beside &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; as permutative signifies, "I, my part," although it might also be an acc. of closer definition (as pro parte mea, for my part), or even - which is, however, less probable - acc. of the obj. (my part). Elihu speaks more in the scholastic tone of controversy than the three. </body></html>
