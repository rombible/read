Or rather he means, that God’s Spirit had so enlightened his understanding by discovering the truth of the matter to him, and had so inspired him with zeal, that he was constrained thereby to plead God’s cause against Job. “As he was a young man,” says Heath, “he dared not claim much authority from his own sayings; but he claims it from the inspiration of the Almighty, by whose Spirit he was actuated, and whose oracles he was delivering.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:15-22 If we are sure that the Spirit of God suggested what we are about to say, still we ought to refrain, till it comes to our turn to speak. God is the God of order, not of confusion. It is great refreshment to a good man, to speak for the glory of the Lord, and to edify others. And the more we consider the majesty of God, as our Maker, and the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less shall we sinfully fear or flatter men. Could we set the wrath Lord always before us, in his mercies and his terrors, we should not be moved from doing our duty in whatever we are called to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I also will show mine opinion - In this language, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>, there is a delicate expression of modesty in the Hebrew which does not appear in our translation. It is &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;  'aph 'a&#774;n&#305;&#770;y - even I. "Even one so young, and so humble as I, may be permitted to express my sentiments, when the aged and the great have nothing more to say. It will be no improper intrusion for even me to speak when no other one more aged and honorable desires to." In all this we may discern a degree of courtesy, and a delicate sense of propriety, which may be commended to the imitation of all, and especially to the young. In the manners of the pious men whose biography is recorded in the Bible, there is a degree of refinement, delicacy, and courtesy, in their treatment of others, such as will seldom be found even in the most elevated walks of life, and such as religion only can produce. The outward form may be obtained by the world; the living principle is found only in the heart which is imbued with love to God and man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. my part&#8212;for my part.<p>opinion&#8212;knowledge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I will take my turn, and speak what they have omitted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I said, I will answer also my part,....

The initial "I said" is superfluous. Elihu, having asked himself the question, "Shall I wait?" in ver. 16, here gives the answer. He will not wait any longer, he will take the word, he will set forth his conviction. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  Behold, I waited upon your words,<p>Hearkened to your perceptions,<p>While ye searched out replies.<p>12  And I attended closely to you,<p>Yet behold: there was no one who refuted Job,<p>Who answered his sentences, from you.<p>13  Lest ye should say: "We found wisdom,<p>God is able to smite him, not man!"<p>14  Now he hath not arranged his words against me,<p>And with your sentences I will not reply to him.<p>He has waited for their words, viz., that they might give utterance to such words as should tend to refute and silence Job. In what follows, &#1506;&#1491; still more emphatically than &#1500; refers this aim to that to which Elihu had paid great attention: I hearkened to your understandings, i.e., explanations of the matter, that, or whether, they came forth, (I hearkened) to see if you searched or found out words, i.e., appropriate words. Such abbreviated forms as &#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;  equals  &#1488;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; (comp. &#1502;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; for &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-4.htm">Proverbs 17:4</a>, Ges. 68, rem. 1, if it does not signify nutriens, from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;) we shall frequently meet with in this Elihu section. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a> evidently is related as an antecedent to what follows: and I paid attention to you (&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; contrary to the analogy of the cognate praep. instead of &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, moreover for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, with the accompanying notion: intently, or, according to Aben-Duran: thoroughly, without allowing a word to escape me), and behold, intently as I paid attention: no one came forward to refute Job; there was no one from or among you who answered (met successfully) his assertions. Every unbiassed reader will have an impression of the remarkable expressions and constructions here, similar to that which one has in passing from the book of the Kings to the characteristic sections of the Chronicles. The three, Elihu goes on to say, shall not indeed think that in Job a wisdom has opposed them - a false wisdom, indeed - which only God and not any man can drive out of the field (&#1504;&#1491;&#1507;, Arab. ndf, discutere, dispellere, as the wind drives away chaff or dry leaves); while he has not, however (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; followed directly by a v. fin. forming a subordinate clause, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-18.htm">Psalm 44:18</a>, and freq., Ew. 341, a), arrayed (&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; in a military sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>; or forensic, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>; or even as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-19.htm">Job 37:19</a>, in the general sense of proponere) words against him (Elihu), i.e., utterances before which he would be compelled to confess himself affected and overcome. He will not then also answer him with such opinions as those so frequently repeated by them, i.e., he will take a totally different course from theirs in order to refute him. </body></html>
