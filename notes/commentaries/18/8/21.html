We may say that if the contrast here indicated is not intended by the speaker, then we must consider the “he” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-16.htm" title="He is green before the sun, and his branch shoots forth in his garden.">Job 8:16</a> the person before spoken of, and must understand his luxuriance of a merely apparent luxuriance; but then in that case one is at a loss to see why the “he,” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-16.htm" title="He is green before the sun, and his branch shoots forth in his garden.">Job 8:16</a> should be emphasised as it is in the Hebrew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-21.htm" title="Till he fill your mouth with laughing, and your lips with rejoicing.">Job 8:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Till he fill thy mouth with laughing — </span>What I have said in general of good men shall be made good to thee if thou art such: God will not forsake thee, nor desist from doing thee good, till he give thee abundant matter of rejoicing.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:20-22 Bildad here assures Job, that as he was so he should fare; therefore they concluded, that as he fared so he was. God will not cast away an upright man; he may be cast down for a time, but he shall not be cast away for ever. Sin brings ruin on persons and families. Yet to argue, that Job was an ungodly, wicked man, was unjust and uncharitable. The mistake in these reasonings arose from Job's friends not distinguishing between the present state of trial and discipline, and the future state of final judgment. May we choose the portion, possess the confidence, bear the cross, and die the death of the righteous; and, in the mean time, be careful neither to wound others by rash judgments, nor to distress ourselves needlessly about the opinions of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Till he fill thy mouth with laughing - Until he make thee completely happy. The word rendered "till" (&#1506;&#1491;  &#8219;ad), is rendered by Dr. Good, "even yet." Noyes, following Houbigant, DeWette, and Michaelis, proposes to change the pointing, and to read &#1506;&#1491;  &#8219;o&#770;d, instead of &#1506;&#1491;  &#8219;ad - meaning, "while." The verse is connected with that which follows, and the particle used here evidently means "while," or "even yet" - and the whole passage means, "if you return to God, he will even yet fill you with joy, while those who hate you shall be clothed with shame. God will show you favor, but the dwelling of the wicked shall come to naught." The object of the passage is to induce Job to return to God, with the assurance that if he did, he would show mercy to him, while the wicked should be destroyed.<p>With rejoicing - Margin, "Shouting for joy." The word used (&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;  teru&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h) is properly that which denotes the clangor of a trumpet, or the shout of victory and triumph. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Directing himself to Job; and suggesting, that if he was a perfect, sincere, and upright man. God would not cast him away utterly, but help him out of his present circumstances, and restore him to prosperity; and not leave him until he had filled his heart with so much joy, that his mouth and lips, being also full of it, should break forth in strong expressions of it, and in the most exulting strains, as if it was a time of jubilee with him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-2.htm">Psalm 126:2</a>; but Bildad tacitly insinuates that Job was not a perfect and good man but an evil doer, whom God had cast away and would not help; and this he concluded from the distressed circumstances he was now in; which was no rule of judgment, and a very unfair way of reasoning, since love and hatred are not to be known by outward prosperity and adversity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>.

Lucan, iv. 136: conseritur bibul Memphytis cymba papyro); but is at the same time Egyptian, since Coptic kam, cham, signifies the reed, and 'go&#770;m, 'go&#772;me, a book (like liber, from the bark of a tree).<p>(Note: Comp. the Book of the Dead (Todtenbuch), ch. 162: "Chapter on the creation of warmth at the back of the head of the deceased. Words over a young cow finished in pure gold. Put them on the neck of the dead, and paint them also on a new papyrus," etc. Papyrus is here cama: the word is determined by papyrus-roll, fastening and writing, and its first consonant corresponds to the Coptic aspirated g. Moreover, we cannot omit to mention that this cama  equals  go&#770;me also signifies a garment, as in a prayer: "O my mother Isis, come and veil me in thy cama."
