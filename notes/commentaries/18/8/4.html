Men's meaning is not taken aright, and then they are rebuked, as if they were evil-doers. Even in disputes on religion, it is too common to treat others with sharpness, and their arguments with contempt. Bildad's discourse shows that he had not a favourable opinion of Job's character. Job owned that God did not pervert judgment; yet it did not therefore follow that his children were cast-aways, or that they did for some great transgression. Extraordinary afflictions are not always the punishment of extraordinary sins, sometimes they are the trials of extraordinary graces: in judging of another's case, we ought to take the favorable side. Bildad puts Job in hope, that if he were indeed upright, he should yet see a good end of his present troubles. This is God's way of enriching the souls of his people with graces and comforts. The beginning is small, but the progress is to perfection.

This must have cut him to the quick, for there was nothing which a bereaved father would feel more acutely than this. The meaning here is somewhat weakened by the word "if." The Hebrew &#1488;&#1501;  '&#305;&#770;m is rather to be taken in the sense of "since" - assuming it as an indisputable point, or taking it for granted. It was not a supposition that if they should now do it, certain other consequences would follow; but the idea is, that since they had been cut off in their sins, if Job would even now seek God with a proper spirit, he might be restored to prosperity, though his beginning should be small; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7</a>.<p>And he have cast them away - Bildad supposes that they had been disowned by God, and had been put to death.<p>For their transgression - Margin, in the hand of their. The Hebrew is, by the hand of their transgression; i. e, their sin has been the cause of it, or it has been by the instrumentality of their sin. What foundation Bildad had for this opinion, derived from the life and character of the sons of Job, we have no means of ascertaining. The probability is, however, that he had learned in general that they had been cut off; and that, on the general principle which he maintained, that God deals with men in this life according to their character, he inferred that they must have been distinguished for wickedness. Men not unfrequently argue in this way when sudden calamity comes upon others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. If&#8212;Rather, "Since thy children have sinned against Him, and (since) He has cast them away (Hebrew, by the hand of) for their transgressions, (yet) if thou wouldst seek unto God, &c., if thou wert pure, &c., surely [even] now He would awake for thee." Umbreit makes the apodosis to, "since thy children," &c., begin at "He has cast them away." Also, instead of "for," "He gave them up to (literally, into the hand of) their own guilt." Bildad expresses the justice of God, which Job had arraigned. Thy children have sinned; God leaves them to the consequence of their sin; most cutting to the heart of the bereaved father.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What though thou wast in a great measure innocent, thy children, upon whom a great part of these calamities fell, might be guilty of great sins; and therefore God is not unrighteous in these proceedings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He hath cast them away, </span> expelled, or cast them out, (to wit, out of the world, or out of his favour; as a man gives his wife a bill of divorce, of which this word is used,)<span class="ital"> by means</span> (Heb. <span class="ital">by the hand</span>, which is oft so used) <span class="ital">of their wickedness</span>.

As no doubt they had, and, as Bildad thought, in a very notorious manner, and therefore were righteously punished for them; this instance is produced as a proof of God's not perverting, but doing justice, and the rather, because it was on account of this that it was supposed that Job charged, or was ready to charge, God with injustice; this was so far from it, that it was a righteous thing to do it, "if" or "seeing" his children had sinned; or "because" they have sinned, or "though" they have sinned, as the words (h) are by some differently rendered; and either way shows that God did not pervert justice, but acted agreeably to it. Mr. Broughton renders them, "as thy children have sinned against him, so hath he sent them into the hand of their trespass"; as a righteous retaliation for it: that Job's children had sinned, there is no question to be made of it; they were born in sin, though born of godly parents; and though they had a religious education, yet no doubt were guilty of sin in their younger years, as well as when grown up; and even though good men, as there may be reason to conclude they were, yet daily sinning, for there are none without sin; and also it is true, that all sin is against God, contrary to his nature and will, a breach and transgression of his law, and an act of hostility against himself, and a trampling under foot, or at least a neglect, of his legislative power and authority, which is an aggravation of it; yet it does not appear that Job's children were guilty of any notorious sins or atrocious crimes, or lived a sinful course of life, for which the judgments of God came upon them; nor is it a clear case that they were taken away by death in the manner they were on account of their sins, but rather purely for the trial of Job's integrity, faith, and patience: <p>and he have cast them away for their transgression; or "by the hand of it" (i); by means of it, because of it, being provoked with it. Bildad represents them as abandoned sinners, as castaways and reprobates, rejected of God with abhorrence, and utterly ruined. Some render it, "hath sent them into the hand of their transgression" (k), or trespass; that is, delivered them up to the power and dominion of sin, gave them up to their hearts' lusts, and to vile affections, to do things not convenient, and which they pursued to their ruin; the Targum is,"he sent them into the place of their transgression (l);''into hell, which their transgressions deserved, and for which they were fitted by them. Some a little more mildly render the words, "he sent them away" (m); that is, dismissed them out of the world, took them out of it by death; which dismission is sometimes in peace, as good old Simeon prayed for, and sometimes in wrath, as Saul was taken away, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-29.htm">Luke 2:29</a>; the latter is the meaning here. <p>(h) "quandoquidem", Michaelis; "quia", Vatablus; "etiamsi", V.

But more probably <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-4.htm" title="If your children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;">Job 8:4</a></span> is complete in itself: <span class="ital">if thy children have sinned so</span> (or, then) <span class="ital">he hath, &c</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cast them away for</span>] Rather lit., <span class="bld">he hath sent them away</span>, or, let them go, <span class="bld">into the hand</span> of their transgression. The idea is that evil carries its own retribution with it, and that a sinner is destroyed by the very sin which he commits, a common idea in the Book, cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm" title="Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.">Job 4:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm" title="Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense.">Job 15:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm" title="They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepares deceit.">Job 15:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/18-7.htm" title="The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down....">Job 18:7-8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-12.htm" title="Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;">Job 20:12</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>. Though Bildad puts his reference to the children of Job hypothetically there is great harshness in the allusion, and we may understand how the father would smart under it from his own reference later in the Book to the time when his children were yet alive: “When my boys were about me,” ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-5.htm" title="When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;">Job 29:5</a>. A wiser and more human-hearted Teacher than Bildad has instructed us from the instances of the affliction of blindness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/9-2.htm" title="And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?...">John 9:2-3</a>) and the accident in the tower of Siloam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-4.htm" title="Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelled in Jerusalem?">Luke 13:4</a>) that calamity is no proof of guilt in those on whom it falls, and that evil may serve in the hand of God wider uses than the chastisement of individuals. This is the very lesson of the Book of Job, though it seems that men in the days of our Lord had not yet learned it. The verse refers back to ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm" title="And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:19</a>, and is evidence that the Prologue forms an integral part of the Book.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">4–7</span>. In opposition to Job’s impious principle Bildad brings forward his doctrine of the Divine rectitude on both its sides, the one illustrated in the fate of Job’s children (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-4.htm" title="If your children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;">Job 8:4</a></span>), the other, as he hopes, to be illustrated in the history of Job himself (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/8-5.htm" title="If you would seek to God betimes, and make your supplication to the Almighty;...">Job 8:5-7</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thy children have sinned against him</span>.
