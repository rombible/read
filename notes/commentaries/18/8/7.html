Men's meaning is not taken aright, and then they are rebuked, as if they were evil-doers. Even in disputes on religion, it is too common to treat others with sharpness, and their arguments with contempt. Bildad's discourse shows that he had not a favourable opinion of Job's character. Job owned that God did not pervert judgment; yet it did not therefore follow that his children were cast-aways, or that they did for some great transgression. Extraordinary afflictions are not always the punishment of extraordinary sins, sometimes they are the trials of extraordinary graces: in judging of another's case, we ought to take the favorable side. Bildad puts Job in hope, that if he were indeed upright, he should yet see a good end of his present troubles. This is God's way of enriching the souls of his people with graces and comforts. The beginning is small, but the progress is to perfection. Dawning light grows to noon-day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though thy beginning was small - On the supposition that the children of Job had been cut off, his family now was small. Yet Bildad says, that if he were to begin life again, even with so small a family, and in such depressed and trying circumstances, if he were a righteous man he might hope for returning prosperity.<p>Yet thy latter end - From this, it is evident that Job was not now regarded as an old man. He would still have the prospect of living many years. Some have supposed, however that the meaning here is, that his former prosperity should appear small compared with that which he would hereafter enjoy if he were pure and righteous. So Noyes and Rosenmuller interpret it. But it seems to me that the former interpretation is the correct one. Bildad utters a general sentiment, that though when a man begins life he has a small family and little property, yet if he is an upright man, he will be prospered and his possessions will greatly increase; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a> : "Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than the beginning." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. thy beginning&#8212;the beginning of thy new happiness after restoration.<p>latter end&#8212;(Job 42:12; Pr 23:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The sense is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

When, he first set out in the world; and which though it greatly increased, and he was the greatest man in all the east, yet Bildad suggests, should he behave well, that was comparatively small to what it would be with him hereafter; and which was fact, for he had double of what he before enjoyed; so Mr. Broughton renders the words, "and thy former state should be little to thy latter": or rather the sense and meaning is, "though thy beginning should be small" (r); be it so that it is; or rather that though he should begin again in the world with very little, as indeed at present he had nothing to begin with, and when he did it was but with little; one gave him a piece of money, and another an earring of gold: <p>yet thy latter end should greatly increase; as it did, for the Lord blessed his latter end, and he had more than at the beginning, even double to what he had in his most flourishing circumstances; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-11.htm">Job 42:11</a>, &amp;c. Bildad seems to have spoken under a spirit of prophecy, without being sensible of it, and not imagining in the least that so it would be in fact; for he only affirms it on supposition of Job's good behaviour for the future, putting it entirely upon that condition, which he had no great expectation of it ever being performed. <p>(r) "etsi fuerit", so some in Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Though thy beginning <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</span><p>(d) Though the beginning is not as pleasant as you would like, yet in the end you will have sufficient opportunity to please yourself.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">thy beginning</span>] i. e., thy former estate, before affliction; similarly “latter end” (read: thy latter end <span class="bld">shall</span> greatly increase) is said of his future condition of prosperity; see the same use of the words ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-12.htm" title="So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.">Job 42:12</a>. The verse means that his former estate shall seem small in comparison with the splendour of his renewed prosperity. It is curious that the Author here allows Bildad to utter a prophecy, the literal fulfilment of which, though not through the means suggested by Bildad, he takes care expressly to chronicle.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though thy beginning was small</span>; rather, <span class="accented">were small</span>. Bildad does not refer to the past, but to the present. Though, if God were now to set to work to prosper Job, his beginning would be slender indeed, yet what the outcome might be none could know. God might prosper him greatly. <span class="cmt_word">Yet thy latter end should greatly increase</span>. Here, once mere, Bildad does but follow in the steps of Eliphaz (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18-26</a>), prophesying smooth things, as be had done. It is difficult to believe that either comforter put any faith in the prospect which he held out, or imagined that Job would really be restored to prosperity. Rather there is a covert sarcasm in their words. If thou weft indeed so free from guilt as thou claimest to be, then thou wouldst be confident of a happy issue out of thy afflictions. If thou art not confident of such an issue, it is because thou art conscious of guilt. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then began Bildad the Shuhite, and said:<p>  2  How long wilt thou utter such things,<p>And the words of thy mouth are a boisterous wind?<p>  3  Will God reverse what is right,<p>Or the Almighty reverse what is just?<p>  4  When thy children sinned against Him,<p>He gave them over to the hand of their wickedness.<p>Bildad<p>(Note: Nothing can be said respecting the signification of the name &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491; even as a probable meaning, unless perhaps  equals  &#1489;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1491;, sine mammis, i.e., brought up without his mother's milk.)<p>begins harshly and self-confidently with quousque tandem, &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1503; instead of the usual &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, not: this, but: of this kind, of such kind, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is poetical, equivalent to &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is gen. comm. in the signification wind as well as spirit, although more frequently fem. than masc. He means that Job's speeches are like the wind in their nothingness, and like a boisterous wind in their vehemence. Bildad sees the justice of God, the Absolute One, which ought to be universally acknowledged, impugned in them. In order not to say directly that Job's children had died such a sudden death on account of their sin, he speaks conditionally. If they have sinned, death is just the punishment of their sin. God has not arbitrarily swept them away, but has justly given them over to the destroying hand of their wickedness, - a reference to the prologue which belongs inseparably to the whole. </body></html>
