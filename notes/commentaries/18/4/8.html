That good men were never thus ruined. But there is one event both to the righteous and to the wicked, Ec 9:2, both in life and death; the great and certain difference is after death. Our worst mistakes are occasioned by drawing wrong views from undeniable truths. 2. That wicked men were often thus ruined: for the proof of this, Eliphaz vouches his own observation. We may see the same every day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even as I have seen - Eliphaz appeals to his own observation, that people who had led wicked lives were suddenly cut off. Instances of this kind he might doubtless have observed - as all may have done. But his inference was too broad when he concluded that all the wicked are punished in this manner. It is true that wicked people are thus cut off and perish; but it is not true that all the wicked are thus punished in this life, nor that any of the righteous are not visited with similar calamities. His reasoning was of a kind that is common in the world - that of drawing universal conclusions from premises that are too narrow to sustain them, or from too few carefully observed facts.<p>They that plow iniquity - This is evidently a proverbial expression; and the sense is, that as people sow they reap. If they sow wheat, they reap wheat; if barley, they reap barley; if tares, they reap tares.

Here he goes about to prove, by his own experience, the destruction of wicked men; and would intimate, that Job was such an one, because of the ruin he was fallen into: <p>they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same; figurative expressions, denoting that such who devise iniquity in their hearts, form and plan schemes of it in their minds, signified by "plowing iniquity", and who were studious and diligent to put into practice what they devised; who took a great deal of pains to commit sin, and were constant at it, expressed by "sowing wickedness": these sooner or later eat the fruit of their doings, are punished in proportion to their crimes, even in this life, as well as hereafter, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>; though a Jewish commentator (b) observes, that the thought of sin is designed by the first phrase; the endeavour to bring it into action by the second; and the finishing of the work, or the actual commission of the evil, by the third; the punishment thereof being what is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9</a>; the Targum applies this to the generation of the flood. <p>(b) R.

The words might be also rendered, <span class="ital">when I saw those that ploughed iniquity … they reaped it</span>. Eliphaz draws a distinction between two classes of men, on both of whom affliction may come—the righteous, who may no doubt sin and be chastised for their sin, but who do not perish under their chastisements (see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm" title="Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects: therefore despise not you the chastening of the Almighty:">Job 5:17</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.), and the wicked, whose sinning is, so to speak, a business which they practise as the tiller ploughs and sows his field, and whose harvest is unfailing. The words <span class="ital">iniquity</span> and <span class="ital">wickedness</span> may mean also <span class="ital">affliction</span> and <span class="ital">trouble</span>. The two pairs of things correspond to one another. That which the wicked plough and cast into the ground may be iniquity and wickedness, they reap it in the form of affliction and trouble. For the figure comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm" title="For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it has no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.">Hosea 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-13.htm" title="You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped iniquity; you have eaten the fruit of lies: because you did trust in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.">Hosea 10:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8–27</span>. Third, surely instead of despairing and murmuring under his afflictions Job should follow a very different way. I, says Eliphaz, putting himself in Job’s place, would seek unto God, all whose doings are directed to the saving of the meek and disappointing the devices of the evil. When He smites, He smites only that He may the more profoundly heal. Happy should the man count himself whom God corrects. for his correction is meant to awaken him out of his dream of evil and lead him into a broader, clearer life, rich in blessings, and to be crowned with a ripe and peaceful end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This beautiful speech consists of three parts, of which the first contains a single division, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/4-1.htm" title="Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,...">Job 4:1-11</a>; the second, two divisions, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/4-12.htm" title="Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof....">Job 4:12-21</a>, and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/5-1.htm" title="Call now, if there be any that will answer you; and to which of the saints will you turn?...">Job 5:1-7</a>; and so also the third, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/5-8.htm" title="I would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause:...">Job 5:8-16</a>, and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/5-17.htm" title="Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects: therefore despise not you the chastening of the Almighty:...">Job 5:17-27</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as I have seen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">according as</span> I <span class="accented">have seen</span> - so far, that is, as my observation goes (see the Revised Version, which is supported by Professor Lee and Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">They that plough iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7, 8</a>). The words translated "iniquity" and "wickedness" express in the original both moral and physical evil. Men sew the one and reap the other. Eliphaz extends this general rule into a universal law, or, at any rate, declares that he has never known an exception. He has not, therefore, been grieved and perplexed, like David, by "seeing the ungodly in such prosperity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3</a>). He would seem not to have been a man of very keen observation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  2  If one attempts a word with thee, will it grieve thee?<p>And still to restrain himself from words, who is able?<p>  3  Behold, thou hast instructed many,<p>And the weak hands thou hast strengthened.<p>  4  The stumbling turned to thy words,<p>And the sinking knees thou hast strengthened.<p>  5  But now it cometh to thee, thou art grieved;<p>Now it toucheth thee, thou despondest.<p>The question with which Eliphaz beings, is certainly one of those in which the tone of interrogation falls on the second of the paratactically connected sentences: Wilt thou, if we speak to thee, feel it unbearable? Similar examples are <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4</a>; and with interrogative Wherefore? <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a> : comp. the similar paratactic union of sentences, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11</a>. The question arises here, whether &#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; is an Aramaic form of writing for &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; (as the Masora in distinction from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a> takes it), and also either future, Wilt thou, if we raise, i.e., utter, etc.; or passive, as Ewald formerly, <p>(Note: In the second edition, comp. Jahrb. ix. 37, he explains it otherwise: "If we attempt a word with thee, will it be grievous to thee quod aegre feras?" But that, however, must be &#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;; the form &#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; can only be third pers. Piel: If any one attempts, etc., which, according to Ewald's construction, gives no suitable rendering.)<p>If a word is raised, i.e., uttered, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, like &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a>; or whether it is third pers. Piel, with the signification, attempt, tentare, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:23</a>. The last is to be preferred, because more admissible and also more expressive. &#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; followed by the fut. is a hypothetic praet., Supposing that, etc., wilt thou, etc., as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; is the Aramaic plur. of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which is more frequent in the book of Job than the Hebrew plur. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. The futt., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-3.htm">Job 4:3</a>., because following the perf., are like imperfects in the western languages: the expression is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-3.htm">Isaiah 35:3</a>.
