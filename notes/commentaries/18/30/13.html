Perhaps here, also, the image is taken from war, and Job may represent himself as on a line of march, and he says that this rabble comes and breaks up his path altogether. They break down the bridges, and tear up the way, so that it is impossible to pass along. His plans of life were embarrassed by them, and they were to him a perpetual annoyance.<p>They set forward my calamity - Luther renders this part of the verse, "It was so easy for them to injure me, that they needed no help." The literal translation of the Hebrew here would be, "they profit for my ruin;" that is, they bring as it were profit to my ruin; they help it on; they promote it. A similar expression occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>, "I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the afliction;" that is, they aided in urging it forward. The idea here is, that they hastened his fall. Instead of assisting him in any way, they contributed all they could to bring him down to the dust.<p>They have no helper - Very various interpretations have been given of this phrase. It may mean, that they had done this alone, without the aid of others; or that they were persons who were held in abhorrence, and whom no one would assist; or that they were worthless and abandoned persons. Schultens has shown that the phrase, "one who has no helper," is proverbial among the Arabs, and denotes a worthless person, or one of the lowest class. In proof of this, he quotes the Hamasa, which he thus translates, Videmus vos ignobiles, pauperes, quibus nullus ex reliquis hominibus adjutor. See, also, other similar expressions quoted by him from Arabic writings. The idea here then is, probably, that they were so worthless and abandoned that no one would help them - an expression denoting the utmost degradation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

And although Job had no hopes of a temporal deliverance or restitution, yet he could not but observe and resent the malice of those who did their utmost to hinder it. Or the sense is, They pervert all my ways, putting perverse and false constructions upon them, censuring all my conscientious discharges of my duty to God and men, as nothing but craft and hypocrisy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They set forward my calamity; </span> increasing it by their bitter taunts, and invectives, and censures.

"The troglodyte was very often able to go without nourishment and the necessaries of life. Their habitations are not unfrequently found where no cultivation of the land was possible, e.g., in Safa. They were therefore the rearers of cattle or marauders. The cattle-rearing troglodyte, because he cannot wander about from one pasture to another like the nomads who dwell in tents, often loses his herds by a failure of pasture, heavy falls of snow (which often produce great devastation, e.g., in Hauran), epidemics, etc. Losses may also arise from marauding attacks from the nomads. Still less is this marauding, which is at enmity with all the world, likely to make a race prosperous, which, like the troglodyte, being bound to a fixed habitation, cannot escape the revenge of those whom it has injured." - Wetzst.)<p>As <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a> shows, there underlies <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a> a comparison of this people with the wild ass. The &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, fer, goes about in herds under the guidance of a so-called leader (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>), with which the poet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a> compares the bands that go forth for forage; here the point of comparison, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a>, is their bitter want, which urges from them the cry of pain; for &#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;, although not too strong, would nevertheless be an inadequate expression for their sermo barbarus (Pineda), in favour of which Schlottmann calls to mind Herodotus' (iv. 183) comparison of the language of the Troglodyte Ethiopians with the screech of the night-owl (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;). Among bushes (especially the bushes of the shih, which affords them some nourishment and shade, and a green resting-place) one hears them, and hears from their words, although he cannot understand them more closely, discontent and lamentation over their desperate condition: there, under nettles (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, root &#1495;&#1512;, Arab. h&#803;rr, as urtica from urere), i.e., useless weeds of the desert, they are poured forth, i.e., spread about in disorder. Thus most moderns take &#1505;&#1508;&#1495;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498;, Arab. sfh&#803;, comp. &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, profusus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-7.htm">Amos 6:7</a>, although one might also abide by the usual Hebrew meaning of the verb &#1505;&#1508;&#1495; (hardened from &#1505;&#1508;&#1492;), adjungere, associare (vid., Habak. S. 88), and with Hahn explain: under nettles they are united together, i.e., they huddle together. But neither the fut. nor the Pual (instead of which one would expect the Niph. or Hithpa.) is favourable to the latter interpretation; wherefore we decide in favour of the former, and find sufficient support for a Hebr.-Arabic &#1505;&#1508;&#1495; in the signification effundere from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a> and the present passage. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>, by dividing the hitherto latent subject, tells what sort of people they are: sons of fools, profane, insane persons (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>); moreover, or of the like kind (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, not &#1488;&#1507;), sons of the nameless, ignobilium or infamium, since &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is here an adj. which stands in dependence, not filii infamiae  equals  infames (Hirz. and others), by which the second &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is rendered unlike the first. The assertion <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a> may be taken as an attributive clause: who are driven forth ... ; but the shortness of the line and the prominence of the verb are in favour of the independence of the clause like an exclamation in its abrupt and halting form. &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is Niph. of &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1492; (&#1504;&#1499;&#1497;), root &#1504;&#1498;, to hew, pierce, strike.<p>(Note: The root Arab. nk is developed in Hebr. &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, in Arab. naka'a and naka&#770;, first to the idea of outward injury by striking, hewing, etc.; but it is then also transferred to other modes of inflicting injury, and in Arab. nawika, to being injured in mind. The root shows itself in its most sensuous development in the reduplicated form Arab. naknaka, to strike one with repeated blows, fig. for: to press any one hard with claims. According to another phase, the obscene Arab. na&#770;ka, fut. i, and the decent Arab. nakah&#803;a, signify properly to pierce. - Fl.)<p>On &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, of arable land in opposition to the steppe, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-17.htm">Job 18:17</a>. </body></html>
