The word rendered "youth" (&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1495;  pirchach) occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Scriptures. It is probably from &#1508;&#1512;&#1495;  pa&#770;rach, "to sprout, germinate, blossom"; and hence, would mean "a progeny," and would be probably applied to beasts. It is rendered by Jerome, "calamities;" by the Septuagint, "Upon the right hand of the progeny, or brood (&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  blastou), they rise," where Schleusner conjectures that &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;_  blastoi should be read, "On the right hand rise a brood or progeny." Umbreit renders it, "eine Brut ... a brood." So Rosenmuller, Noyes, and Schultens. The idea then is, that this rabble rose up, even on his right hand, as a brood of wild animals - a mere rabble that impeded his way.<p>They push away my feet - Instead of giving place for me, they jostle and crowd me from my path. Once the aged and the honorable rose and stood in my presence, and the youth retired at my coming, but now this worthless rabble crowds along with me, jostles me in my goings, and shows me no manner of respect; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-8.htm">Job 29:8</a>.<p>And they raise up against me the ways of their destruction - They raise up against me destructive ways, or ways that tend to destroy me. The figure is taken from an advancing army, that casts up ramparts and other means of attack designed for the destruction of a besieged city. They were, in like manner, constantly making advances against Job, and pressing on him in a manner that was designed to destroy him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. youth&#8212;rather, a (low) brood.

"Springeth", as Mr. Broughton translates the word; such as were just sprung into being, as it were; the word (n) seems to have the signification of young birds that are not fledged; have not got their feathers on them, but are just got out of the shell, as it were; and such were these young men: some render the word the "flower" (o); as if the flower of men, the chief and principal of them, were meant, such as were Job's three friends, who are here distinguished from the mean and baser sort before spoken of; but the word even in this sense signifies young men, who are like buds and flowers just sprung out, or who are beardless boys, or whose beards are just springing out; so the young priests are in the Misnah (p) called "the flowers of the priesthood": now such as these rose up, not in reverence to Job, as the aged before did, but in an hostile way, to oppose, resist, reproach, and deride him; they rose up on his right hand, took the right hand of him, as if they were his superiors and betters; or they stood at his right hand, took the right hand to accuse him, as Satan did at Joshua's; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>; <p>they push away my feet; they brought heavy charges and violent accusations against him, in order to cast him down, and trample upon him; nor would they suffer him to stand and answer for himself; he could have no justice done him, and so there was no standing for him. If this was to be understood literally, of their pushing at him to throw him down to the ground, or of an attempt trip up his heels, so that his feet were almost gone, and his steps had well nigh slipped, it was very rude and indecent treatment of him indeed: <p>and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction; as, in besieging a town, mounts, forts, and batteries are raised to destroy it, so those persons made use of all ways and means to destroy Job; or they trod upon him, and made him as a path or causeway to walk upon, in order utterly to destroy him. Mr. Broughton renders the words, "they cast upon me the causes of their woe", imputed all their calamities and miseries to him, reproached him on that account, and now were resolved to revenge themselves on him. <p>(n) "pullities", Schultens.

"The troglodyte was very often able to go without nourishment and the necessaries of life. Their habitations are not unfrequently found where no cultivation of the land was possible, e.g., in Safa. They were therefore the rearers of cattle or marauders. The cattle-rearing troglodyte, because he cannot wander about from one pasture to another like the nomads who dwell in tents, often loses his herds by a failure of pasture, heavy falls of snow (which often produce great devastation, e.g., in Hauran), epidemics, etc. Losses may also arise from marauding attacks from the nomads. Still less is this marauding, which is at enmity with all the world, likely to make a race prosperous, which, like the troglodyte, being bound to a fixed habitation, cannot escape the revenge of those whom it has injured." - Wetzst.)<p>As <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a> shows, there underlies <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a> a comparison of this people with the wild ass. The &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, fer, goes about in herds under the guidance of a so-called leader (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>), with which the poet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a> compares the bands that go forth for forage; here the point of comparison, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a>, is their bitter want, which urges from them the cry of pain; for &#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;, although not too strong, would nevertheless be an inadequate expression for their sermo barbarus (Pineda), in favour of which Schlottmann calls to mind Herodotus' (iv. 183) comparison of the language of the Troglodyte Ethiopians with the screech of the night-owl (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;). Among bushes (especially the bushes of the shih, which affords them some nourishment and shade, and a green resting-place) one hears them, and hears from their words, although he cannot understand them more closely, discontent and lamentation over their desperate condition: there, under nettles (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, root &#1495;&#1512;, Arab. h&#803;rr, as urtica from urere), i.e., useless weeds of the desert, they are poured forth, i.e., spread about in disorder.

S. 88), and with Hahn explain: under nettles they are united together, i.e., they huddle together. But neither the fut. nor the Pual (instead of which one would expect the Niph. or Hithpa.) is favourable to the latter interpretation; wherefore we decide in favour of the former, and find sufficient support for a Hebr.-Arabic &#1505;&#1508;&#1495; in the signification effundere from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a> and the present passage. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>, by dividing the hitherto latent subject, tells what sort of people they are: sons of fools, profane, insane persons (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>); moreover, or of the like kind (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, not &#1488;&#1507;), sons of the nameless, ignobilium or infamium, since &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is here an adj. which stands in dependence, not filii infamiae  equals  infames (Hirz. and others), by which the second &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is rendered unlike the first. The assertion <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a> may be taken as an attributive clause: who are driven forth ... ; but the shortness of the line and the prominence of the verb are in favour of the independence of the clause like an exclamation in its abrupt and halting form. &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is Niph. of &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1492; (&#1504;&#1499;&#1497;), root &#1504;&#1498;, to hew, pierce, strike.<p>(Note: The root Arab. nk is developed in Hebr. &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, in Arab. naka'a and naka&#770;, first to the idea of outward injury by striking, hewing, etc.; but it is then also transferred to other modes of inflicting injury, and in Arab. nawika, to being injured in mind. The root shows itself in its most sensuous development in the reduplicated form Arab. naknaka, to strike one with repeated blows, fig. for: to press any one hard with claims.
