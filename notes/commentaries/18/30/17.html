Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My bones are pierced in me - The bones are often represented in the Scriptures as the seat of acute pain; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-11.htm">Job 20:11</a>.

It is mentioned as a special aggravation of his sufferings that they were "in the night" - a time when we expect repose.<p>And my sinews take no rest - See the word here rendered sinews explained in the note at ver. 3.

I see no reason to doubt that the teeth or the jaws are meant, and that Job refers to the violent pain in the tooth, among the acutest pains to which the body is subject.

Such was the force of his disease, that it pierced and penetrated even into his bones, and the marrow of them; and such the pain that he endured in the muscles and tendons about them, and especially in the joints of them, that it was as if all his bones were piercing and breaking to pieces; he was in a like condition the sick man is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19</a>; and as David and Hezekiah were, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>; and what aggravated his case was, that this was "in the night season", when he should have got some sleep and rest, but could not for his pain: some render the words by supplying them thus; God, or the disease, or the pain, pierced my bones in the night season; or "the night pierced my bones from me"; so Mr. Broughton; but rather they may be rendered, and the sense be, <p>"in the night season everyone of my bones pierce "the flesh" that is upon me:'' <p>his flesh was almost wasted and consumed, through the boil and ulcers on him, and he was reduced to a mere skeleton; and when he laid himself down on his bed, these pierced through his skin, and stuck out, and gave him exquisite pain: <p>and my sinews take no rest; being contracted; or his nerves, as the word in the Arabic language signifies, as is observed by Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Donesh, and others; which were loosened, and the animal spirits were sunk, and he so low and dispirited, that he could get no rest: or the pulsatile veins and arteries, as Ben Gersom and Elias Levita (a), in which the pulse beats, and which beats with less strength when persons are asleep than when awake; but such was the force of Job's disease, that it beat even in the night, when on his bed, so strongly, that he could take no rest for it; the pulse beats, as physicians say (b), sixty times in a minute, and double the number in a burning fever, and which might be Job's case. Some take the word in the sense of fleeing or gnawing (c), as it is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-3.htm">Job 30:3</a>; and interpret it either of his enemies, who pursued after him, and had no rest in their beds, but went out in the night to inquire and hear what they could learn concerning him and his illness, whether it was become greater (d); or who devoured him by their calumnies and detractions, and could not sleep unless they did mischief to him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>; or of the worms with which his body was covered, and which were continually gnawing, never rested, nor suffered him to take any rest; the Targum is, they that gnash at me rest not. <p>(a) In Tishbi, p. 67.

This rabble, constitutionally as well as morally degraded, when it comes upon Job's domain in its marauding expeditions, makes sport of the sufferer, whose former earnest admonitions, given from sympathizing anxiety for them, seemed to them as insults for which they revenge themselves. He is become their song of derision (&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501; to be understood according to the dependent passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a>), and is &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; to them, their &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; (lxx), the subject of their foolish talk (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; - Arab. mille, not  equals  melle, according to which Schultens interprets it, sum iis fastidio). Avoiding him, and standing at a distance from him, they make their remarks upon him; and if they come up to him, it is only for the sake of showing him still deeper scorn: a facie ejus non cohibent sputam. The expositors who explain that, contrary to all decent bearing, they spit in his presence (Eichh., Justi, Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst.), or with Fie! spit out before him (Umbr., Hahn, Schlottm.), overlook the fact of its being &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;. The expression as it stands can only affirm that they do not spare his face with spitting (Jer. correctly: conspuere non veruntur), so that consequently he is become, as he has complained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>, a &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;, an object of spitting (comp. also the declaration of the servant of Jehovah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, which stands in close connection with this declaration of Job, according to previous explanations).<p>It now becomes a question, Who is the subj. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>? The Chethib &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493; demands an attempt to retain the previous subj. Accordingly, most moderns explain: solvit unusquisque eorum funem suum, i.e., frenum suum, quo continebatur antea a me (Rosenm., Umbr., Stick., Vaih., Hlgst., and others), but it is to be doubted whether &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; can mean frenum; it signifies a cord, the string of a bow, and of a harp. The reconciliation of the signification redundantia, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20</a>, and funis, is, in the idea of the root, to be stretched tight and long.<p>(Note: The Arab. verb watara shows its sensuous primary signification in Arab. watarun, &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, cord, bow-string, harp-string (Engl. string): to stretch tight, to extend, so that the thing continues in one line. Hence then Arab. watrun, witrun, separate, unequal, singulus, impar, opp. Arab. s&#780;af&#8219;un, bini, par, just as fard, single, separate, unequal (opp. zaug, a pair, equal number), is derived from farada, properly, so to strain or stretch out, that the thing has no bends or folds; Greek &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; (as in the Shepherd of Hermas: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), an original transitive signification still retained in low Arabic (vid., Bocthor under tendre and Dployer). Then from Arab. watara spring the secondary roots Arab. tatara and tara&#770;, which proceed from the VIII form (ittatara). The former (tatara) appears only in the Arab. adverb tatran and tatra&#770;, sigillatim, alii post alios, singly one after another, so that several persons or things form a row interrupted by intervals of space of time; the latter (tara) and its IV form (atra) are equivalent to wa&#770;tara, to be active at intervals, with pauses between, as the Arabs explain: "We say Arab. atra&#770; of a man when he so performs several acts which do not directly follow one another, that there is always a [Arab.] fatrat, intermissio, between two acts." Hence also &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, duals of an assumed sing. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, singulus (um), &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; singula, therefore prop. duo singuli (a), duae singulae, altogether parallel to the like meaning thina&#770;ni (ithna&#770;ni', thinaini (ithnaini), &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; fem. thinta&#770;ni (ithnata&#770;ni), thintaini (ithnataini), &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, from an assumed sing. thin-un (ithn-un), thint-un (ithnat-un), from Arab. tana&#770;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, like bin (ibn), bint (ibnat), &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;, hence &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) from Arab. bana&#770;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;.<p>The significations of watara which Freytag arranges under 1, 2, 3, 4, proceed from the transitive application of &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, as the Italian soperchiare, soverchiare, from supra, to offend, insult; oltraggiare, outrager, from ultra; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; from &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;. Similarly, Arab. tt&#803;a&#770;wl &#8219;l&#305;&#770;h and &#8219;stt&#803;a&#770;l &#8219;l&#305;&#770;h (form VI and X from t&#803;a&#770;l), to act haughtily towards any one, to make him feel one's superiority, properly to stretch one's self out over or against any one.<p>But in another direction the signif. to be stretched out goes into: overhanging, surpassing, projecting, to be superfluous, and to be left over, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to exceed a number or bulk, superare (comp. Italian soperchiare as intrans.), &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; to prove, as result, gain, etc., &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, etc. Similar is the development of the meaning of Arab. fad&#803;ala and of t&#803;a&#770;'l, gain, use, from Arab. t&#803;a&#770;l, to be stretched out. In like manner, the German reich, reichlich rich, abundant, comes from the root reichen, recken to stretch, extend. - Fl.)<p>continued...</body></html>
