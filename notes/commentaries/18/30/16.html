Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And now my soul is poured out upon me - So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>, "I pour out my soul in me."

Either in prayer to God for help and deliverance; or rather he was dissolved as it were in floods of tears, because of his distress and anguish; or his spirits were sunk, his strength and courage failed, and his heart melted, and was poured out like water; yea, his soul was pouring out unto death, and he was, as he apprehended, near unto it; his body was so weakened and broken by diseases, that it was like a vessel full of holes, out of which the liquor runs away apace; so his life and soul were going away from him, his vital spirits were almost exhausted: <p>the days of affliction have taken hold upon me; afflictions seize on good men as well as others, and on them more than others; and there are certain times and seasons for them, appointed and ordered by the Lord; and there is a limited time, they are not to continue always, only for some days, for a time, and but a little time, and then they will have an end; but till that time comes, there can be no deliverance from them; being sent they come, coming they seized on Job, they laid hold on him, they "caught" him, as Mr. Broughton renders it, and held him fast, and would not let him go; nor could he get clear of them till God delivered him, who only can and does deliver out of them in his own time and way. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And now my soul is <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</span><p>(l) My life fails me, and I am as half dead.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>.

This rabble, constitutionally as well as morally degraded, when it comes upon Job's domain in its marauding expeditions, makes sport of the sufferer, whose former earnest admonitions, given from sympathizing anxiety for them, seemed to them as insults for which they revenge themselves. He is become their song of derision (&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501; to be understood according to the dependent passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a>), and is &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; to them, their &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; (lxx), the subject of their foolish talk (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; - Arab. mille, not  equals  melle, according to which Schultens interprets it, sum iis fastidio). Avoiding him, and standing at a distance from him, they make their remarks upon him; and if they come up to him, it is only for the sake of showing him still deeper scorn: a facie ejus non cohibent sputam. The expositors who explain that, contrary to all decent bearing, they spit in his presence (Eichh., Justi, Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst.), or with Fie! spit out before him (Umbr., Hahn, Schlottm.), overlook the fact of its being &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;. The expression as it stands can only affirm that they do not spare his face with spitting (Jer. correctly: conspuere non veruntur), so that consequently he is become, as he has complained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>, a &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;, an object of spitting (comp. also the declaration of the servant of Jehovah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, which stands in close connection with this declaration of Job, according to previous explanations).<p>It now becomes a question, Who is the subj. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>? The Chethib &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493; demands an attempt to retain the previous subj. Accordingly, most moderns explain: solvit unusquisque eorum funem suum, i.e., frenum suum, quo continebatur antea a me (Rosenm., Umbr., Stick., Vaih., Hlgst., and others), but it is to be doubted whether &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; can mean frenum; it signifies a cord, the string of a bow, and of a harp. The reconciliation of the signification redundantia, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20</a>, and funis, is, in the idea of the root, to be stretched tight and long.<p>(Note: The Arab. verb watara shows its sensuous primary signification in Arab. watarun, &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, cord, bow-string, harp-string (Engl. string): to stretch tight, to extend, so that the thing continues in one line. Hence then Arab. watrun, witrun, separate, unequal, singulus, impar, opp. Arab. s&#780;af&#8219;un, bini, par, just as fard, single, separate, unequal (opp. zaug, a pair, equal number), is derived from farada, properly, so to strain or stretch out, that the thing has no bends or folds; Greek &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; (as in the Shepherd of Hermas: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), an original transitive signification still retained in low Arabic (vid., Bocthor under tendre and Dployer). Then from Arab. watara spring the secondary roots Arab. tatara and tara&#770;, which proceed from the VIII form (ittatara). The former (tatara) appears only in the Arab. adverb tatran and tatra&#770;, sigillatim, alii post alios, singly one after another, so that several persons or things form a row interrupted by intervals of space of time; the latter (tara) and its IV form (atra) are equivalent to wa&#770;tara, to be active at intervals, with pauses between, as the Arabs explain: "We say Arab. atra&#770; of a man when he so performs several acts which do not directly follow one another, that there is always a [Arab.] fatrat, intermissio, between two acts." Hence also &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, duals of an assumed sing. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, singulus (um), &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; singula, therefore prop. duo singuli (a), duae singulae, altogether parallel to the like meaning thina&#770;ni (ithna&#770;ni', thinaini (ithnaini), &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; fem. thinta&#770;ni (ithnata&#770;ni), thintaini (ithnataini), &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, from an assumed sing. thin-un (ithn-un), thint-un (ithnat-un), from Arab. tana&#770;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, like bin (ibn), bint (ibnat), &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;, hence &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) from Arab. bana&#770;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;.<p>The significations of watara which Freytag arranges under 1, 2, 3, 4, proceed from the transitive application of &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, as the Italian soperchiare, soverchiare, from supra, to offend, insult; oltraggiare, outrager, from ultra; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; from &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;. Similarly, Arab. tt&#803;a&#770;wl &#8219;l&#305;&#770;h and &#8219;stt&#803;a&#770;l &#8219;l&#305;&#770;h (form VI and X from t&#803;a&#770;l), to act haughtily towards any one, to make him feel one's superiority, properly to stretch one's self out over or against any one.<p>But in another direction the signif. to be stretched out goes into: overhanging, surpassing, projecting, to be superfluous, and to be left over, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to exceed a number or bulk, superare (comp. Italian soperchiare as intrans.), &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; to prove, as result, gain, etc., &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, etc. Similar is the development of the meaning of Arab. fad&#803;ala and of t&#803;a&#770;'l, gain, use, from Arab. t&#803;a&#770;l, to be stretched out. In like manner, the German reich, reichlich rich, abundant, comes from the root reichen, recken to stretch, extend. - Fl.)<p>continued...</body></html>
