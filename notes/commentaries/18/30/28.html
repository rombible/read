Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I went mourning - Or rather, "I go," in the present tense, for he is now referring to his present calamities, and not to what was past. The word rendered "mourning," however (&#1511;&#1491;&#1512;  qa&#770;dar), means here rather to be dark, dingy, tanned. It literally means to be foul or turbid, like a torrent, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>; then to go about in filthy garments, as they do who mourn, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-11.htm">Job 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2</a>; then to be dusky, or of a dark color, or to become dark. Thus, it is applied to the sun and moon becoming dark in an eclipse, or when covered with clouds, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>. Here it refers to the fact that, by the mere force of his disease, his skin had become dark and swarthy, though he had not been exposed to the burning rays of the sun. The wrath of God had burned upon him, and he had become black under it. Jerome, however, renders it moerens, mourning. The Septuagint, "I go groaning (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  steno&#772;n) without restraint, or limit" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  aneu fimou. The Chaldee translates it &#1488;&#1493;&#1499;&#1501;, "black."<p>Without the sun - Without being exposed to the sun; or without the agency of the sun. Though not exposed, he had become as dark as if he had been a day-laborer exposed to a burning sun.<p>I stood up - Or, I stand up.<p>And cried in the congregation - I utter my cries in the congregation, or when surrounded by the assembled people. Once I stood up to counsel them, and they hung upon my lips for advice; now I stand up only to weep over my accumulated calamities. This indicates the great change which had come upon him, and the depth of his sorrows. A man will weep readily in private; but he will be slow to do it, if he can avoid it, when surrounded by a multitude. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. mourning&#8212;rather, I move about blackened, though not by the sun; that is, whereas many are blackened by the sun, I am, by the heat of God's wrath (so "boiled," Job 30:27); the elephantiasis covering me with blackness of skin (Job 30:30), as with the garb of mourning (Jer 14:2).

Instead of consolingly answering his prayer, and instead of showing Himself willing to help, God, who was formerly so kind towards him, changes towards him, His creature, into a cruel being, saevum (&#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512; in the book of Job only here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm">Job 41:2</a>, where it signifies "foolhardy;" comp. &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; in the dependent passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>), and makes war upon him (&#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1501; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>) by causing him to feel the strength of His omnipotent hand (&#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1497;&#1491; as <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17</a>, synon. &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;).<p>It is not necessary in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a> to forsake the accentuation, and to translate: Thou raisest me up, Thou causest me go in the wind (Ew., Hirz., and others); the accentuation of &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; is indeed not a disjunctive Dech, but a conjunctive Tarcha, but preceded by Munach, which, according to the rule, Psalter ii. 500, 5, here, where two conjunctives come together, has a smaller conjunctive value. Therefore: elevas me in ventum, equitare facis me, viz., super ventum (Dachselt), for one does not only say &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7</a>, or &#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-12.htm">Psalm 66:12</a>, but also &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>; and accordingly &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is also not to be translated: Thou snatchest me into the wind or storm (Hahn, Schlottm.), but: Thou raisest me up to the wind or storm, as upon an animal for riding (Umbr., Olsh.). According to Oriental tradition, Solomon rode upon the east wind, and in Arabic they say of one who hurried rapidly by, racab al-gena&#770;hai er-rih, he rides upon the wings of the wind; in the present passage, the point of comparison is the being absolutely passively hurried forth from the enjoyment of a healthy and happy life to a dizzy height, whence a sudden overthrow threatens him who is unwillingly removed (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>, Thou hast lifted me up and hurled me forth).<p>The lot which threatens him from this painful suspense Job expresses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>) in the puzzling words: &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1502;&#1490;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;.

The modern expositors who follow the Keri, by taking &#1493;&#1514;&#1502;&#1490;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497; for &#1493;&#1514;&#1502;&#1490;&#1490; &#1500;&#1497; (according to Ges. 121, 4), translate: Thou causest counsel and understanding (Welte), happiness (Blumenf.), and the like, to vanish from me; continuance, existence, duration would be better (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-13.htm">Job 6:13</a>, and especially on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>). The thought it appropriate, but the expression is halting. Jerome, who translates valide, points to the correct thing, and Buxtorf (Lex. col. 2342f.) by interpreting the not less puzzling Targum translation in fundamento  equals  funditus or in essentia  equals  essentialiter, has, without intending it, hit upon the idea of the Hebr. Keri; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is intended as a closer defining, or adverbial, accusative: Thou causest me to vanish as to existence, ita ut tota essentia pereat h.e. totaliter et omnino. Perhaps this was really the meaning of the poet: most completely, most thoroughly, altogether, like the Arab. h&#803;aqqan. But it is unfavourable to this Keri, that &#1514;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492; (from the verb &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;), as might be expected, is always written plene elsewhere; the correction of the &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; is violent, and moreover this form, correctly read, gives a sense far more consistent with the figure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>. Ges., Umbr., and Carey falsely read &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, terres me; this verb is unknown in Hebr., and even in Chaldee is only used in Ithpeal, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; ( equals  Hebr. &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;); for a similar reason Bttcher's &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; (which is intended to mean: in despair) is also not to be used. Even Stuhlmann perceived that &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; is equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;; it is, with Ew. and Olsh., to be read &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; (not with Pareau and Hirz. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; without the Dag.), and this form signifies, as &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-29.htm">Job 36:29</a>, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, from which it is derived by change of consonants, the crash of thunder, or even the rumbling or roar as of a storm or a falling in (procellae sive ruinae). The meaning is hardly, that he who rides away upon the stormy wind melts and trickles down like drops of rain among the pealing of the thunder, when the thunder-storm, whose harbinger is the stormy wind, gathers; but that in the storm itself, which increases in fury to the howling of a tempest, he dissolves away. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a> : their soul melted away (dissolved) &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;. The compulsory journey in the air, therefore, passes into nothing or nearly nothing, as Job is well aware, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a> : "for I:know: (without &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-21.htm">Psalm 9:21</a>) Thou wilt bring me back to death" (acc. of the goal, or locative without any sign). If &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is taken in its most natural signification reduces, death is represented as essentially one with the dust of death (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>), or even with non-existence, out of which man is come into being; nevertheless &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; can also, by obliterating the notion of return, like redigere, have only the signification of the turn of destiny and change of condition that is effected. The assertion that &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; always includes an "again," and retains it inexorably (vid., Khler on <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, S. 239), is untenable. In post-biblical Hebrew, at least, it is certain that &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; signifies not only "to become again," but also "to become," as Arab. &#8219;a&#770;d is used as synon. of ja&#770;'in, devenir.<p>(Note: Vid., my Anekdota der mittelalterlichen Scholastik unter Juden und Moslemen, S. 347.)<p>With &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the designation of the condition, is coupled the designation of the place: Hades (under the notion of which that of the grave is included) is the great involuntary rendezvous of all who live in this world. </body></html>
