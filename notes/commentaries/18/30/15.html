Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Terrors are turned upon me - As if they were all turned upon him, or made to converge toward him. Everything suited to produce terror seemed to have a direction given it toward him. Umbreit, and some others, however, suppose that God is here referred to, and that the meaning is," God is turned against me terrors drive as a storm against me." The Hebrew will bear either construction; but it is more emphatic and impressive to suppose it means that everything adapted to produce terror seemed to be turned against him.<p>They pursue my soul as the wind - Margin, my principal one. The word "they" here, refers to the terrors. In the original text, the word &#1514;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507;  tira&#770;daph agrees with &#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1492;  balla&#770;ha&#770;h, terrors understood, for this word is often used as a collective noun, and with a singular verb, or it may agree with &#1488;&#1492;&#1514; &#1499;&#1500; - "each one of the terrors persecutes me." There is more difficulty about the word rendered "soul" in the text, and "principal one" in the margin - &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;  ned&#305;&#770;yba&#770;h. It properly means willingness, voluntariness, spontaneity; then a free-will offering, a voluntary sacrifice; then largeness, abundance. Rosenmuller renders it, "My vigor." Noyes, "My prosperity," and so Coverdale. Jerome, "My desire," and the Septuagint, "My hope passes away as the wind." Schultens translates it, "They persecute my generous spirit as the wind." It seems probable that the word refers to a generous, noble nature; to a large and liberal soul, evincing its magnanimity in acts of generosity and hospitality; and the idea seems to be, that his enemies rushed against that generous nature like a tempest. They wholly disregarded it, and a nature most generous and noble was exposed to the fury of the storm.<p>And my welfare - Hebrew my salvation; or my safety.<p>As a cloud - As a cloud vanishes and wholly disappears. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. they&#8212;terrors.<p>soul&#8212;rather, "my dignity" [Umbreit].<p>welfare&#8212;prosperity.<p>cloud&#8212;(Job 7:9; Isa 44:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Terrors, </span> to wit, from God, who sets himself against me, and in some sort joins his forces with these miscreants. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Are turned upon me; </span> are directed against me, to whom they seem not to belong, as being the portion of wicked men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My soul, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">my principal or excellent one</span>, i.e. my soul, which is fitly so called, as being the chief part of man; as it is called a man’s glory, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm" title="O my soul, come not you into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not you united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they dig down a wall.">Genesis 49:6</a></span>, and his <span class="ital">only one</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm" title="Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.">Psalm 22:20</a></span>, and which is the proper seat and object of Divine terrors, as his body was of his outward pains and ulcers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As the wind, </span> i.e. speedily, vehemently, and irresistibly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My welfare; </span> all the happiness and comfort of any life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As a cloud; </span> which is quickly dissolved into rain, or dissipated by the sun, or driven away with the wind. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Terrors are turned upon me,.... Not the terrors of a guilty conscience, for Job had a clear one, and held fast his integrity; nor the terrors of a cursing and condemning law, for he knew he was justified by his living Redeemer, and his sins forgiven for his sake; nor the terrors of death, for that he had made familiar to him, and greatly desired it; nor the terrors of a future judgment, for there was nothing he was more solicitous for than to appear before the judgment seat of God, and take his trial there; but the afflictions that were upon him from the hand of God that was turned on him, who now hid his face from him, and withheld the influences of his grace and layout, and appeared as an enemy, and as a cruel one to him; the reason of all which he knew not, and this threw him into consternation of mind, and filled him with terror. Some (s) read the words <p>"my glory is turned into terrors;'' <p>instead of being in the honour and glory, prosperity and happiness, he had been in, he was now possessed of terrors and distresses of various kinds: others render the words, "he is turned against me, as terrors", or "into terrors", or "with them" (t); God cannot be turned or changed in his nature, in his will, counsel, purposes, and decrees, nor in his love and affection to his people; but he may turn in the outward dispensations of his providence according to his unchangeable will, as from evil to good, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-9.htm">Jonah 3:9</a>; so from doing good to evil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; this is complained of by the church, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-3.htm">Lamentations 3:3</a>; and deprecated by Jeremiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-17.htm">Jeremiah 17:17</a>; or there is "a turn, terrors are upon me"; there was a very visible turn in Job's affairs in many respects, in his health, substance, and family, and particularly in this; while he was in his office as a civil magistrate, and in all the glory of it, he was a terror to evil doers; and young men, when he appeared, hid themselves for fear of him; but now those impudently rise up against him, and are terrors to him: or there is an "overthrow" (u), an overturning of things, as of his civil and temporal affairs, so of his spiritual ones; instead of that peace, serenity, and tranquillity of mind he had enjoyed; now nothing but terror and distress of mind on account of his afflictions and troubles: <p>they pursue my soul as the wind; terrors one after another; they pursued him closely, with great swiftness, and with a force irresistible, like the wind; they pursued his soul, his life, and threatened the taking away of it: the word for soul is not the usual word for it; it signifies "my principal one", as in the margin, as the soul is the principal part of man, the immortal breath of God, the inhabitant in the tenement of the body, the jewel in the cabinet, immaterial and immortal, and of more worth than the whole world; or "my princely one", being of a princely original, is from God, the Father of spirits, of a noble extract: Mr. Broughton renders it my "nobility", having princely rule and government in the body; that using the members of the body as its instruments; and especially it may be said to have such rule, when grace is implanted in it, as a ruling governing principle; and the Targum is, my principality or government: it may be rendered, "my free" (w), liberal, ingenuous, and munificent one: Job had such a generous and beneficent soul; but now all means of exercising generosity and liberality were cut off from him; and particularly he had find a free ingenuous one, as he was actuated by the free spirit of God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-12.htm">Psalm 51:12</a>, where this word is used; but now terrors pursuing him, a spirit of bondage unto fear was brought upon him: some (x) consider it as an apostrophe to God, "thou pursues, my soul, O God", &amp;c. but rather the meaning is, a distress or affliction pursued it, or everyone of the above terrors: <p>and my welfare passeth away as a cloud; or "my salvation" (y); not spiritual and eternal salvation, that was firm and stable, being fixed by the unalterable decree of God, secured in the covenant of grace, and engaged for to be wrought out by his living. Redeemer, and of which he had an application by the Spirit of God, and was possessed of the blessings of it; and though the joys and comforts of it, and views of interest in it, may go off for a while, yet Job seems to have had a strong faith of interest in it, and a lively and well grounded hope of its being his, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; but his temporal salvation, health, and happiness, were gone suddenly, swiftly, utterly, entirely, totally, as a cloud dissolved into rain, or dissipated by the rays of the sun, or driven away with the wind, so as to be seen no more; nor had he any hope of its being restored to him: some understand this, as Sephorno, of the salvation with which he had saved others; but it was no more in the power of his hands, and the remembrance of it was gone from those who shared in it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>. <p>(s) So some in Bar Tzemach in loc.

"Terrors' take hold upon him. He experiences in his sleep horrible dreams and visions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>), and even in his waking hours he is haunted by fears. The "terrors of God do set themselves in array against him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>). God seems to him as One that watches, and "tries him every moment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-18.htm">Job 7:18</a>), seeking occasion against him, and never leaving him an instant's peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>). These terrors, he says, <span class="cmt_word">pursue my soul as the wind</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pursue mine honour</span>, or <span class="accented">my dignity.</span> They flutter the calm composure that befits a godly man, disturb it, shake it, and for a time at any rate, cause terrors and shrinkings of soul.

This rabble, constitutionally as well as morally degraded, when it comes upon Job's domain in its marauding expeditions, makes sport of the sufferer, whose former earnest admonitions, given from sympathizing anxiety for them, seemed to them as insults for which they revenge themselves. He is become their song of derision (&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501; to be understood according to the dependent passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a>), and is &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; to them, their &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; (lxx), the subject of their foolish talk (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; - Arab. mille, not  equals  melle, according to which Schultens interprets it, sum iis fastidio). Avoiding him, and standing at a distance from him, they make their remarks upon him; and if they come up to him, it is only for the sake of showing him still deeper scorn: a facie ejus non cohibent sputam. The expositors who explain that, contrary to all decent bearing, they spit in his presence (Eichh., Justi, Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst.), or with Fie! spit out before him (Umbr., Hahn, Schlottm.), overlook the fact of its being &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;. The expression as it stands can only affirm that they do not spare his face with spitting (Jer. correctly: conspuere non veruntur), so that consequently he is become, as he has complained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>, a &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;, an object of spitting (comp. also the declaration of the servant of Jehovah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, which stands in close connection with this declaration of Job, according to previous explanations).<p>It now becomes a question, Who is the subj. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>? The Chethib &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493; demands an attempt to retain the previous subj. Accordingly, most moderns explain: solvit unusquisque eorum funem suum, i.e., frenum suum, quo continebatur antea a me (Rosenm., Umbr., Stick., Vaih., Hlgst., and others), but it is to be doubted whether &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; can mean frenum; it signifies a cord, the string of a bow, and of a harp. The reconciliation of the signification redundantia, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20</a>, and funis, is, in the idea of the root, to be stretched tight and long.<p>(Note: The Arab. verb watara shows its sensuous primary signification in Arab. watarun, &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, cord, bow-string, harp-string (Engl. string): to stretch tight, to extend, so that the thing continues in one line. Hence then Arab. watrun, witrun, separate, unequal, singulus, impar, opp. Arab. s&#780;af&#8219;un, bini, par, just as fard, single, separate, unequal (opp. zaug, a pair, equal number), is derived from farada, properly, so to strain or stretch out, that the thing has no bends or folds; Greek &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; (as in the Shepherd of Hermas: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), an original transitive signification still retained in low Arabic (vid., Bocthor under tendre and Dployer). Then from Arab. watara spring the secondary roots Arab. tatara and tara&#770;, which proceed from the VIII form (ittatara). The former (tatara) appears only in the Arab. adverb tatran and tatra&#770;, sigillatim, alii post alios, singly one after another, so that several persons or things form a row interrupted by intervals of space of time; the latter (tara) and its IV form (atra) are equivalent to wa&#770;tara, to be active at intervals, with pauses between, as the Arabs explain: "We say Arab. atra&#770; of a man when he so performs several acts which do not directly follow one another, that there is always a [Arab.] fatrat, intermissio, between two acts." Hence also &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, duals of an assumed sing. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, singulus (um), &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; singula, therefore prop. duo singuli (a), duae singulae, altogether parallel to the like meaning thina&#770;ni (ithna&#770;ni', thinaini (ithnaini), &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; fem. thinta&#770;ni (ithnata&#770;ni), thintaini (ithnataini), &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, from an assumed sing. thin-un (ithn-un), thint-un (ithnat-un), from Arab. tana&#770;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, like bin (ibn), bint (ibnat), &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;, hence &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) from Arab. bana&#770;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;.<p>The significations of watara which Freytag arranges under 1, 2, 3, 4, proceed from the transitive application of &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, as the Italian soperchiare, soverchiare, from supra, to offend, insult; oltraggiare, outrager, from ultra; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; from &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;. Similarly, Arab. tt&#803;a&#770;wl &#8219;l&#305;&#770;h and &#8219;stt&#803;a&#770;l &#8219;l&#305;&#770;h (form VI and X from t&#803;a&#770;l), to act haughtily towards any one, to make him feel one's superiority, properly to stretch one's self out over or against any one.<p>But in another direction the signif. to be stretched out goes into: overhanging, surpassing, projecting, to be superfluous, and to be left over, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to exceed a number or bulk, superare (comp.
