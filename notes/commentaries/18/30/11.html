That is, God had rendered him incapable of vindicating himself, or of inflicting punishment. The figure, according to this interpretation, is taken from a bow, and Job means to say that his bow was relaxed, his vigor was gone, and they now felt that they might insult him with impunity. But instead of the usual reading in the Hebrew text &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;  yithriy - "my nerve," another reading &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;  yithriv - "his nerve," is found in the qeri (margin). This reading has been adopted in the text by Jahn, and is regarded as genuine by Rosenmuller, Umbreit, and Noyes. According to this, the meaning is, that the worthless rabble that now treated him with so much contempt, had relaxed all restraint, and they who had hitherto been under some curb, now rushed upon him in the most unbridled manner. They had cast off all restraint arising from respect to his rank, standing, moral worth, and the dread of his power, and now treated him with every kind of indignity.<p>And afflicted me - By the disrespect and contempt which they have evinced.<p>They have also let loose the bridle before me - That is, they have cast off all restraint - repeating the idea in the first member of the verse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Not his silver cord, for then he must have died immediately, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>; though it may be understood of the loosening of his nerves through the force of his disease, and the afflictions he endured from God and man, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a>; or rather of the shattered state and condition of his family and substance; which, while he enjoyed, he had respect and reverence from men; but now all being loosed, scattered, and destroyed, he was treated with derision and scorn; or, better still, of his power and authority as a civil magistrate, by which, as with a cord, he bound many to subjection and obedience to him, and which commanded reverence of him; but this being now loosed and removed from him, persons of the baser sort behaved in an insolent manner towards him; there is a "Keri", or a marginal reading of this clause, which we follow; but the "Cetib", or written text, is "his cord"; and so Mr. Broughton renders it, "he hath loosed his string"; which he explains of the string or rein of his government, that holdeth base men from striving with the mighty, and which comes to the same sense; for the power and authority Job had as a governor were of God, and which he had now loosened; the allusion may be to the string of a bow, which being loosed, it cannot cast out the arrow; and respect may be had to what Job had said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29-20.htm">Job 29:20</a>, "my bow was renewed in my hand"; it then abode in strength, and its strength was renewed; but now he had lost his power and strength, at least it was greatly weakened, that he could not defend himself, nor punish the wicked: <p>and afflicted me; that is, God, who is also understood in the preceding clause, though not expressed. Job's afflictions were many, and there were second causes of them, who were the movers, instruments, and means of them, as Satan, the Sabeans and Chaldeans, yet they were of God, as the appointer, orderer, and sender of them; and so Job understood them, and always as here ascribed them to him; wherefore there was a just cause for them, and an end to be answered by them, and it became Job patiently to bear them, and to wait the issue of them: now, on this account, the above persons were emboldened and encouraged to use Job in the ill manner they did: <p>they have also let loose the bridle before me; the restraints that were upon them when Job was in his prosperity, and had the reins of government in his hand; these they now cast off, and showed no manner of reverence of him, nor respect for him; and the bridle that was upon their mouths, which kept them from speaking evil of him while he was in power, now they slipped it from them, and gave themselves an unbounded liberty in deriding, reproaching, and reviling him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1</a>; and this they did before him, in his presence and to his face, who before were mute and silent. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because he hath loosed my <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> cord, and afflicted me, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> they have also let loose the bridle before me.</span><p>(f) God has taken from me the force, credit, and authority with which I kept them in subjection.<p>(g) He said that the young men when they saw him, hid themselves as in Job 29:8, and now in his misery they were impudent and licentious.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm" title="Because he has loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.">Job 30:11</a></span> is very variously understood; it may mean,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For they have loosed their rein and humbled me,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They have cast off the bridle before me.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So taken, the two clauses have much the same meaning, each being a figurative manner of saying that the low rabble have cast off all restraint, and subject the sufferer to painful humiliations.

"The troglodyte was very often able to go without nourishment and the necessaries of life. Their habitations are not unfrequently found where no cultivation of the land was possible, e.g., in Safa. They were therefore the rearers of cattle or marauders. The cattle-rearing troglodyte, because he cannot wander about from one pasture to another like the nomads who dwell in tents, often loses his herds by a failure of pasture, heavy falls of snow (which often produce great devastation, e.g., in Hauran), epidemics, etc. Losses may also arise from marauding attacks from the nomads. Still less is this marauding, which is at enmity with all the world, likely to make a race prosperous, which, like the troglodyte, being bound to a fixed habitation, cannot escape the revenge of those whom it has injured." - Wetzst.)<p>As <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a> shows, there underlies <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a> a comparison of this people with the wild ass.

Among bushes (especially the bushes of the shih, which affords them some nourishment and shade, and a green resting-place) one hears them, and hears from their words, although he cannot understand them more closely, discontent and lamentation over their desperate condition: there, under nettles (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, root &#1495;&#1512;, Arab. h&#803;rr, as urtica from urere), i.e., useless weeds of the desert, they are poured forth, i.e., spread about in disorder.

S. 88), and with Hahn explain: under nettles they are united together, i.e., they huddle together. But neither the fut. nor the Pual (instead of which one would expect the Niph. or Hithpa.) is favourable to the latter interpretation; wherefore we decide in favour of the former, and find sufficient support for a Hebr.-Arabic &#1505;&#1508;&#1495; in the signification effundere from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a> and the present passage. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>, by dividing the hitherto latent subject, tells what sort of people they are: sons of fools, profane, insane persons (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>); moreover, or of the like kind (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, not &#1488;&#1507;), sons of the nameless, ignobilium or infamium, since &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is here an adj. which stands in dependence, not filii infamiae  equals  infames (Hirz. and others), by which the second &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is rendered unlike the first. The assertion <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a> may be taken as an attributive clause: who are driven forth ... ; but the shortness of the line and the prominence of the verb are in favour of the independence of the clause like an exclamation in its abrupt and halting form. &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is Niph. of &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1492; (&#1504;&#1499;&#1497;), root &#1504;&#1498;, to hew, pierce, strike.<p>(Note: The root Arab. nk is developed in Hebr. &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, in Arab. naka'a and naka&#770;, first to the idea of outward injury by striking, hewing, etc.; but it is then also transferred to other modes of inflicting injury, and in Arab. nawika, to being injured in mind.
