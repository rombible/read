Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By the great force of my disease - The words "of my disease" are not in the Hebrew. The usual interpretation of the passage is, that in consequence of the foul and offensive nature of his malady, his garment had become discolored or defiled - changed from being white and clear to filthiness and offensiveness. Some have understood it as referring to the skin, and as denoting that it was so affected with the leprosy, that he could scarcely be recognized. Umbreit supposes it to mean, "Through the omnipotence of God has my white robe of honor been changed into a narrow garment of grief" - trauerkleid. Dr. Good renders it, "From the abundance of the acrimony;" that is, of the fierce or acrimonious humor, "it is changed into a garment for me." Coverdale, "With all their power have they changed my garment, and girded me therewith, as it were with a coat." Prof. Lee, "With much violence doth my clothing bind me."<p>According to Schultens, it means, "My affliction puts itself on in the form of my clothing;" and the whole passage, that without and within, from the head to the feet, he was entirely diseased. His affliction was his outer garment, and it was his inner garment - his mantle and his tunic. The Hebrew is difficult. The phrase rendered "by the great force," means, literally, "by the multitude of strength" - and may refer to the strength of disease, or to the strength of God, or to the force with which his garment girded him. The word rendered "is changed" - &#1497;&#1514;&#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;  yitcha&#770;phas&#769;, is from &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;  cha&#770;phas&#769;, to seek, to search after in the Qal; in the Hithpael, the form used here, to let oneself be sought; to hide oneself; to disguise one's self; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-38.htm">1 Kings 20:38</a>. According to this, it would mean that his garment was disquised; that is, its appearance was changed by the force of his disease. Gesenius. Jerome renders it, "In their multitude, my garment is consumed; the Septuagint, "With great force he took hold of my garment." Of these various interpretations, it is impossible to determine which is the correct one. The prevailing interpretation seems to be, that by the strength of his disease his garment was changed in its appearance, so as to become offensive, and yet this is a somewhat feeble sense to give to the passage. Perhaps the explanation of Schultens is the best, "By the greatness of power, pain or disease has become my garment; it girds me about like the mouth of my tunic." He has shown, by a great variety of instances, that it is common in Arabic poetry to compare pain, sickness, anxiety, etc., to clothing.<p>It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat - The collar of my tunic, or under garment. This was made like a shirt, to be gathered around the neck, and the idea is, that his disease fitted close to him, and was gathered close around him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. of my disease&#8212;rather, "of God" (Job 23:6).<p>garment changed&#8212;from a robe of honor to one of mourning, literally (Job 2:8; Joh 3:6) and metaphorically [Umbreit]. Or rather, as Schuttens, following up Job 30:17, My outer garment is changed into affliction; that is, affliction has become my outer garment; it also bindeth me fast round (my throat) as the collar of the inner coat; that is, it is both my inner and outer garment. Observe the distinction between the inner and outer garments. The latter refers to his afflictions from without (Job 30:1-13); the former his personal afflictions (Job 30:14-23). Umbreit makes "God" subject to "bindeth," as in Job 30:19.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> My disease is so strong and prevalent, that it breaks forth every where in my body, in such plenty of purulent and filthy matter, that it infects and discolours my very garments.

This rabble, constitutionally as well as morally degraded, when it comes upon Job's domain in its marauding expeditions, makes sport of the sufferer, whose former earnest admonitions, given from sympathizing anxiety for them, seemed to them as insults for which they revenge themselves. He is become their song of derision (&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501; to be understood according to the dependent passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a>), and is &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; to them, their &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; (lxx), the subject of their foolish talk (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; - Arab. mille, not  equals  melle, according to which Schultens interprets it, sum iis fastidio). Avoiding him, and standing at a distance from him, they make their remarks upon him; and if they come up to him, it is only for the sake of showing him still deeper scorn: a facie ejus non cohibent sputam. The expositors who explain that, contrary to all decent bearing, they spit in his presence (Eichh., Justi, Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst.), or with Fie! spit out before him (Umbr., Hahn, Schlottm.), overlook the fact of its being &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;. The expression as it stands can only affirm that they do not spare his face with spitting (Jer. correctly: conspuere non veruntur), so that consequently he is become, as he has complained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>, a &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;, an object of spitting (comp. also the declaration of the servant of Jehovah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, which stands in close connection with this declaration of Job, according to previous explanations).<p>It now becomes a question, Who is the subj. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>? The Chethib &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493; demands an attempt to retain the previous subj. Accordingly, most moderns explain: solvit unusquisque eorum funem suum, i.e., frenum suum, quo continebatur antea a me (Rosenm., Umbr., Stick., Vaih., Hlgst., and others), but it is to be doubted whether &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; can mean frenum; it signifies a cord, the string of a bow, and of a harp. The reconciliation of the signification redundantia, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20</a>, and funis, is, in the idea of the root, to be stretched tight and long.<p>(Note: The Arab. verb watara shows its sensuous primary signification in Arab. watarun, &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, cord, bow-string, harp-string (Engl. string): to stretch tight, to extend, so that the thing continues in one line. Hence then Arab. watrun, witrun, separate, unequal, singulus, impar, opp. Arab. s&#780;af&#8219;un, bini, par, just as fard, single, separate, unequal (opp. zaug, a pair, equal number), is derived from farada, properly, so to strain or stretch out, that the thing has no bends or folds; Greek &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; (as in the Shepherd of Hermas: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), an original transitive signification still retained in low Arabic (vid., Bocthor under tendre and Dployer). Then from Arab. watara spring the secondary roots Arab. tatara and tara&#770;, which proceed from the VIII form (ittatara). The former (tatara) appears only in the Arab. adverb tatran and tatra&#770;, sigillatim, alii post alios, singly one after another, so that several persons or things form a row interrupted by intervals of space of time; the latter (tara) and its IV form (atra) are equivalent to wa&#770;tara, to be active at intervals, with pauses between, as the Arabs explain: "We say Arab. atra&#770; of a man when he so performs several acts which do not directly follow one another, that there is always a [Arab.] fatrat, intermissio, between two acts." Hence also &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, duals of an assumed sing. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, singulus (um), &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; singula, therefore prop. duo singuli (a), duae singulae, altogether parallel to the like meaning thina&#770;ni (ithna&#770;ni', thinaini (ithnaini), &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; fem. thinta&#770;ni (ithnata&#770;ni), thintaini (ithnataini), &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, from an assumed sing. thin-un (ithn-un), thint-un (ithnat-un), from Arab. tana&#770;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, like bin (ibn), bint (ibnat), &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;, hence &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) from Arab. bana&#770;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;.<p>The significations of watara which Freytag arranges under 1, 2, 3, 4, proceed from the transitive application of &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, as the Italian soperchiare, soverchiare, from supra, to offend, insult; oltraggiare, outrager, from ultra; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; from &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;. Similarly, Arab. tt&#803;a&#770;wl &#8219;l&#305;&#770;h and &#8219;stt&#803;a&#770;l &#8219;l&#305;&#770;h (form VI and X from t&#803;a&#770;l), to act haughtily towards any one, to make him feel one's superiority, properly to stretch one's self out over or against any one.<p>But in another direction the signif. to be stretched out goes into: overhanging, surpassing, projecting, to be superfluous, and to be left over, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to exceed a number or bulk, superare (comp. Italian soperchiare as intrans.), &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; to prove, as result, gain, etc., &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, etc. Similar is the development of the meaning of Arab. fad&#803;ala and of t&#803;a&#770;'l, gain, use, from Arab. t&#803;a&#770;l, to be stretched out. In like manner, the German reich, reichlich rich, abundant, comes from the root reichen, recken to stretch, extend. - Fl.)<p>continued...</body></html>
