Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me - This was a complaint which Job often made, that he could not get the ear of God; that his prayer was not regarded, and that he could not get his cause before him; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-19.htm">Job 13:19</a> ff, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-9.htm">Job 27:9</a>.<p>I stand up - Standing was a common posture of prayer among the ancients; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-14.htm">1 Kings 8:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-55.htm">1 Kings 8:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-2.htm">Nehemiah 9:2</a>.

Which added greatly to his affliction, that though he cried to the Lord for help and deliverance, yet he turned a deaf ear to him; and though he heard him, as undoubtedly he did, he did not answer him immediately; at least not in the way in which he desired and expected he would: crying is expressive of prayer, and supposes distress, and denotes vehemence of spirit: <p>I stand up; in prayer, standing being a prayer gesture, as many observe from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm">Matthew 6:5</a>; or he persisted in it, he continued praying, was incessant in it, and yet could obtain no answer; or this signifies silence, as some (f) interpret it; he cried, and then ceased, waiting for an answer; but whether he prayed, or whether he was silent, it was the same thing: <p>and thou regardest me not; the word "not" is not in this clause, but is repeated from the preceding, as it is by Ben Gersom and others; but some read it without it, and give the sense either thus, thou considerest me whether it is fit to receive my prayer or not, so Sephorno; or to renew my strokes, to add new afflictions to me, as Jarchi and Bar Tzemach; or thou lookest upon me as one pleased with the sight of me in such a miserable condition, so far from helping me; wherefore it follows. <p>(f) Jarchi, Ben Gersom, and Bar Tzemach. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>.

The bitterest cry upon the cross was "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" But no good man is ever really God-forsaken, and no rightful and earnest prayers are ever really unheard. Job "had need of patience" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>), patient as he was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>).

Job's complaint is that, when he stands up and stretches out his hands to God in prayer, God simply looks on, does nothing, gives him no help. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The figure of a siege, which is begun with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-12.htm">Job 30:12</a> and continued in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-13.htm">Job 30:13</a>, leaves us in no doubt concerning &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;. The Targ. translates: like the force of the far-extending waves of the sea, not as though &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; could in itself signify a stream of water, but taking it as  equals  &#1508;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a> (synon. diffusio aquarum).

(1855), S. 741, and Proverbs, S. 11.)<p>"like a broad forest stream they come, like a rapid brook they roll on," gives unheard-of significations to the doubtful words. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-14.htm">Job 16:14</a> we heard Job complain: He (Eloah) brake through me &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1508;&#1512;&#1509; &#1508;&#1512;&#1509;, breach upon breach, - by the divine decrees of sufferings, which are completed in this ill-treatment which he receives from good-for-nothing fellows, he is become as a wall with a wide-gaping breach, through which they rush in upon him (instar rupturae, a concise mode of comparison instead of tanquam per rupt.), in order to get him entirely into their power as a plaything for their coarse passions. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; is the crash of the wall with the wide breaches, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; signifies sub fragore in a local sense: through the wall which is broken through and crashes above the assailants. There is no ground in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a> for dividing, with Umbreit, thus: He hath turned against me! Terrors drove away, etc., although this would not be impossible according to the syntax (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1510;&#1506;&#1491;&#1492;). It is translated: terrors are turned against me; so that the predicate stands first in the most natural, but still indefinite, personal form, Ges. 147, a, although &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514; might also be taken as the accus. of the object after a passive, Ges. 143, 1. The subj. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a> remains the same: they (these terrors) drive away my dignity like the wind; the construction is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a>; on the matter, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-11.htm">Job 18:11</a>. Hirz. makes &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; the subj.: quasi ventus aufert nobilitatem meam, in which case the subj. would be not so much ventus as similitudo venti, as when one says in Arabic, 'gani kazeidin, there came to me one of Zeid's equals, for in the Semitic languages &#1499;&#1468; has the manner of an indeclinable noun in the signification instar. But the reference to &#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514; is more natural; and Hahn's objection, that calamity does not first, if it is there, drive away prosperity, but takes the place of that which is driven away, is sophisticated and inadequate, since the object of the driving away here is not Job's prosperity, but Job's &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, appearance and dignity, by which he hitherto commanded the respect of others (Targ. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;). The storms of suffering which pass over him take this nobility away to the last fragment, and his salvation - or rather, since this word in the mouth of an extra-Israelitish hero has not the meaning it usually otherwise has, his prosperous condition (from Arab. wasi&#8219;a, amplum esse) - is as a cloud, so rapidly and without trace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-9.htm">Job 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-22.htm">Isaiah 44:22</a>), passed away and vanished. Observe the music of the expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;, which cannot be reproduced in translation. </body></html>
