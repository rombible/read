When such a wall fell, or when a breach was made in it, the besieging army would pour in in a tumultuous manner, and cut down all before them; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-13.htm">Isaiah 30:13</a>. This seems to be the idea here. The enemies of Job poured in upon him as if a breach was made in a wall. Formerly they were restrained by his rank and office, as a besieging army was by lofty walls; but now all these restraints were broken down, and they poured in upon him like a tumultuous army.<p>In the desolation they rolled themselves upon me - Among the ruins they rolled tumultuous along; or they came pitching and tumbling in with the ruins of the wall. The image is taken from the act of sacking a city, where the besieging army, having made a breach in the wall, would seem to come tumbling into the heart of the city with the ruins of the wall. No time would be wasted, but they would follow suddenly and tumultuously upon the breach, and roll tumultuously along. The Chaldee renders this as if it referred to the rolling and tumultuous waves of the sea, and the Hebrew would admit of such a construction, but the above seems better to accord with the image which Job would be likely to use. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. waters&#8212;(So 2Sa 5:20).

As when a wide breach is made in the banks of a river, or of the sea, the waters rush through in great abundance, with great rapidity and swiftness; and with a force irresistible; and in like manner did Job's enemies rush in upon him in great numbers, overwhelming him in an instant, and he not able to oppose them; or as, when a wide breach is made in the wall of a city besieged, the besiegers pour themselves in, and bear down all before them: and thus Job in a like violent manner was run upon, and bore down by the persons before described: <p>in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me; as when a breach is made in a bank of a river, or of the sea, the waters roll themselves, one wave and flood over another; or, as when a breach is made in a wall, "in the broken place they tumble"; as Mr. Broughton renders it; the soldiers tumble one over another in haste, to get possession and seize the plunder: in such like manner did Job's enemies roll themselves on him, in order to crush and destroy him; and it may be rendered, "because of the desolation" (r), because of bringing calamity on him in order to make him desolate; they came pouring in upon him with all their numbers, force, and strength, to bear him down, and crush him to the earth, as grass may be rolled upon, and beaten down by heavy bodies. <p>(r)  "pro desolatione", Pagninus, Montanus; "propter vestalionem", Noldius, p. 3.

The further description of the habitation of this race of men: in holes (&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;) of the earth (&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, earth with respect to its constituent parts) and rocks (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;), may seem to indicate the aborigines of the mountains of the district of Seir, who are called &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (vid., Genesis, S. 507); but why not, which is equally natural, &#1495;&#1493;&#1512;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a>, the "district of caverns," the broad country about Bosra, with the two Trachnes (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), of which the smaller western, the Leg, is the ancient Trachonitis, and with Ituraea (the mountains of the Druses)? <p>(Note: Wetzstein also inclines to refer the description to the Ituraeans, who, according to Apuleius, were frugum pauperes, and according to others, freebooters, and are perhaps distinguished from the Arabes Trachonitae (if they were not these themselves), as the troglodytes are from the Arabs who dwell in tents (on the troglodytes in Eastern Hauran, vid., Reisebericht, S. 44, 126). "The troglodyte was very often able to go without nourishment and the necessaries of life. Their habitations are not unfrequently found where no cultivation of the land was possible, e.g., in Safa. They were therefore the rearers of cattle or marauders. The cattle-rearing troglodyte, because he cannot wander about from one pasture to another like the nomads who dwell in tents, often loses his herds by a failure of pasture, heavy falls of snow (which often produce great devastation, e.g., in Hauran), epidemics, etc. Losses may also arise from marauding attacks from the nomads. Still less is this marauding, which is at enmity with all the world, likely to make a race prosperous, which, like the troglodyte, being bound to a fixed habitation, cannot escape the revenge of those whom it has injured." - Wetzst.)<p>As <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a> shows, there underlies <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a> a comparison of this people with the wild ass. The &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, fer, goes about in herds under the guidance of a so-called leader (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>), with which the poet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a> compares the bands that go forth for forage; here the point of comparison, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a>, is their bitter want, which urges from them the cry of pain; for &#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;, although not too strong, would nevertheless be an inadequate expression for their sermo barbarus (Pineda), in favour of which Schlottmann calls to mind Herodotus' (iv. 183) comparison of the language of the Troglodyte Ethiopians with the screech of the night-owl (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;). Among bushes (especially the bushes of the shih, which affords them some nourishment and shade, and a green resting-place) one hears them, and hears from their words, although he cannot understand them more closely, discontent and lamentation over their desperate condition: there, under nettles (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, root &#1495;&#1512;, Arab. h&#803;rr, as urtica from urere), i.e., useless weeds of the desert, they are poured forth, i.e., spread about in disorder. Thus most moderns take &#1505;&#1508;&#1495;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498;, Arab. sfh&#803;, comp. &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, profusus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-7.htm">Amos 6:7</a>, although one might also abide by the usual Hebrew meaning of the verb &#1505;&#1508;&#1495; (hardened from &#1505;&#1508;&#1492;), adjungere, associare (vid., Habak. S. 88), and with Hahn explain: under nettles they are united together, i.e., they huddle together. But neither the fut. nor the Pual (instead of which one would expect the Niph. or Hithpa.) is favourable to the latter interpretation; wherefore we decide in favour of the former, and find sufficient support for a Hebr.-Arabic &#1505;&#1508;&#1495; in the signification effundere from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a> and the present passage. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>, by dividing the hitherto latent subject, tells what sort of people they are: sons of fools, profane, insane persons (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>); moreover, or of the like kind (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, not &#1488;&#1507;), sons of the nameless, ignobilium or infamium, since &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is here an adj. which stands in dependence, not filii infamiae  equals  infames (Hirz. and others), by which the second &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is rendered unlike the first. The assertion <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a> may be taken as an attributive clause: who are driven forth ... ; but the shortness of the line and the prominence of the verb are in favour of the independence of the clause like an exclamation in its abrupt and halting form. &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is Niph. of &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1492; (&#1504;&#1499;&#1497;), root &#1504;&#1498;, to hew, pierce, strike.<p>(Note: The root Arab. nk is developed in Hebr. &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, in Arab. naka'a and naka&#770;, first to the idea of outward injury by striking, hewing, etc.; but it is then also transferred to other modes of inflicting injury, and in Arab. nawika, to being injured in mind. The root shows itself in its most sensuous development in the reduplicated form Arab. naknaka, to strike one with repeated blows, fig. for: to press any one hard with claims. According to another phase, the obscene Arab. na&#770;ka, fut. i, and the decent Arab. nakah&#803;a, signify properly to pierce. - Fl.)<p>On &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, of arable land in opposition to the steppe, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-17.htm">Job 18:17</a>. </body></html>
