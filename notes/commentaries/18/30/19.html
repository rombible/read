Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hath cast me into the mire - That is, God has done it. In this book the name of God is often understood where the speaker seems to avoid it, in order that it may not be needlessly repeated.

As Jeremiah was literally; here it is to be understood in a figurative sense; not of the mire of sin, into which God casts none, men fall into it of themselves, but of the mire of affliction and calamity; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>; and which Job here ascribes to God; and whereby he was in as mean, abject, and contemptible a condition, as if he had been thrown into a kennel, and rolled in it; and he speaks of it as an act of God, done with contempt of him, and indignation at him, as he apprehended it. Some Jewish writers (e) interpret it, "he taught me in the mire", or "it taught me"; his disease, his ulcers taught him to sit down in the mire, or in the midst of ashes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>; but though this reading might admit of a good sense, as that Job was taught, as every good man is, many useful lessons in and by afflictions; yet it seems to be a sense foreign from the words: <p>and I am become like dust and ashes; a phrase by which Abraham expresses his vileness, meanness, and unworthiness in the sight of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-27.htm">Genesis 18:27</a>; Job, through the force of his disease, looked like a corpse, or one half dead, and was crumbling and dropping into the dust of death and the grave, and looked livid and ash coloured; and even in a literal sense was covered with dust and ashes, when he sat among them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>; though here it chiefly respects the miserable, forlorn, and contemptible condition in which he was. <p>(e) Vid.

"The mire" here is the lowest depth of misery and degradation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2, 14</a>).

Thus is &#1504;&#1514;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468; (cogn. form of &#1504;&#1514;&#1509;, &#1504;&#1514;&#1506;, &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;) to be translated, not: they tear open (proscindunt), which is contrary to the primary signification and the usage of the language. They, who have no helper, who themselves are so miserable and despised, and yet so feelingless and overbearing, contribute to his ruin. &#1492;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500;, to be useful, to do any good,to furnish anything effective (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12</a>), is here united with &#1500; of the purpose; comp. &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; &#1500;, to help towards anything, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>. &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; (for which the Keri substitutes the primary form &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;), as was already said on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-2.htm">Job 6:2</a>, is prop. hiatus, and then barathrum, pernicies, like &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; in the signification cupiditas, prop. inhiatio. The verb &#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, Arab. hwy, also signifies delabi, whence it may be extended (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>) in like manner to the signification abyss (rapid downfall); but a suitable medium for the two significations, strong passion (Arab. hawa) and abyss (Arab. ha&#770;wije, huwwe, mahwa), is offered only by the signification of the root flare (whence hawa&#770;, air). &#1500;&#1488; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; is a genuine Arabic description of these Idumaean or Hauranite pariahs. Schultens compares a passage of the Hamsa: "We behold you ignoble, poor, laisa lakum min sa&#770;ir-in-na&#770;si nasirun, i.e., without a helper among the rest of men." The interpretations of those who take &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; for &#1500;&#1493;, and this again for &#1500;&#1497; (Eichh., Justi), condemn themselves. It might more readily be explained, with Stick.: without any one helping them, i.e., with their own strong hand; but the thought thus obtained is not only aimless and tame, but also halting and even untrue (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13</a>).</body></html>
