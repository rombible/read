It is good for us to mark it, that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we are not, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does here, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which were cut down - Who were suddenly destroyed by a flood. On the word used here (&#1511;&#1502;&#1496;  qa&#770;mat&#803;) see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-8.htm">Job 16:8</a>. It occurs only in that place and this. Its primary notion is that of drawing together or contracting - as the feet of a lamb or calf are drawn together and tied preparatory to being killed; and the meaning here is, probably, "who were huddled together by the waters," or who were driven in heaps by the deluge, so rapidly and suddenly did it come upon them.<p>Out of time - Hebrew "And there was no time;" that is, it was done in a moment, or suddenly. No time was given them; no delay was granted. The floods rushed over them, and nothing could stay them.<p>Whose foundation was overflown - Margin, or, "a flood was poured upon their foundation." That is, all on which they relied was swept away. The word "foundation" refers to that on which their happiness and security rested, as a house rests on its foundation, and when that is swept away the house falls.<p>With a flood - Hebrew (&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;  na&#770;ha&#770;r) "river." The word is commonly applied to a river; and in the Scriptures, by way of eminence, to the Euphrates; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>, note. It may be used, however, to denote a river which is swollen, and then a flood - and it is several times rendered "flood" in the Scriptures; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-11.htm">Job 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a> (where it means the sea); <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2-3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-11.htm">Job 28:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-3.htm">Psalm 93:3</a>; Sol 8:7. Prof. Lee supposes that the allusion here is to some overflowing of the Euphrates, but the reference seems to be decidedly to the deluge in the time of Noah. The "language" is such as would be used in referring to that, and the fact is just such an one as would be pertinent to the argument of Eliphaz. The fact was undoubtedly well known to all, so that a bare allusion to it would be enough. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. cut down&#8212;rather, "fettered," as in Job 16:8; that is, arrested by death.<p>out of time&#8212;prematurely, suddenly (Job 15:32; Ec 7:17); literally, "whose foundation was poured out (so as to become) a stream or flood."

Sent out of time into eternity, time being no more with men, and they no longer in time, when death seizes upon them; or "before time" (a), before the common term of life, which, according to the course of nature, and human probability, they might have arrived unto: as this is spoken of the men of the old world that lived before the flood, when the lives of men were very long, it is highly probable there, were many that were destroyed by the general deluge, who, had it not for that, might have lived many hundreds of years, according to the usual course: or "without time" (b), without any delay suddenly, at once, at an unawares; for, though they had notice of the flood, they did not regard it, but lived careless and secure; and it came upon them without any further warning, and swept them away, when they were "cut down", as trees by the axe laid to the root of them, to which wicked, men in great power and flourishing circumstances are sometimes compared, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35</a>; or like grass by the scythe, which it is not able to resist, and to which all men are like for their numbers and weaknesses, and who are cut down by death as easily as the grass is by the mower, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>.

Bildad's picture of this fate of the evil-doer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8-10</a>), destruction encompasses him on every side, so that he sees no way out, and must without any escape succumb to it. And the approaching ruin makes itself known to him time after time by terrors which come suddenly upon him and disconcert him; so that his outward circumstances being deranged and his mind discomposed, he has already in anticipation to taste that which is before him. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-11.htm">Job 22:11</a>, &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is by no means to be taken as an eventual circumstantial clause, whether it is translated affirmatively: or darkness (covers thee), that thou canst not see; or interrogatively: or does darkness (surround thee), that thou seest not? In both cases the verb in the principal clause is wanting; apart from the new turn, which &#1488;&#1493; introduces, being none, it would then have to be explained with Lwenthal: or has the habit of sinning already so dulled thy feeling and darkened thine eye, that thou canst not perceive the enormity of thy transgression? But this is a meaning forced from the words which they are not capable of; it must have been at least &#1488;&#1493; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1498;, or something similar. Since &#1488;&#1493; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; (to be accented without Makkeph with Mnach, Dech) cannot form a principal clause of itself, &#1514;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is without doubt the verb belonging to it: or (&#1488;&#1493; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a>) seest thou not darkness? Because, according to his preceding speeches, Job does not question the magnitude of his sufferings, but acknowledges them in all their fearfulness; therefore Hahn believes it must be explained: or shouldst thou really not be willing to see thy sins, which encompass thee as thick dark clouds, which cover thee as floods of water? The two figures, however, can only be understood of the destruction which entirely shrouds Job in darkness, and threatens to drown him. But destruction, in the sense in which Eliphaz asks if Job does not see it, is certainly intended differently to what it was in Job's complaints. Job complains of it as being unmerited, and therefore mysterious; Eliphaz, on the other hand, is desirous that he should open his eyes that he may perceive in this darkness of sorrow, this flood of suffering, the well-deserved punishment of his heinous sins, and anticipate the worst by penitence. &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498;&#1468; is a relative clause, and belongs logically also to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>, where &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1506;&#1514; is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6</a> (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1506;, abundare; comp. Arab. s&#780;f&#8219;, &#1505;&#1508;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>). Eliphaz now insinuates that Job denies the special providence of God, because he doubts the exceptionless, just government of God. In the second strophe he has explained his affliction as the result of his uncharitableness; now he explains it as the result of his unbelief, which is now become manifest. </body></html>
