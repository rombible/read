He begins by asserting that the judgment of God cannot be other than disinterested, that if, therefore, He rewards or punishes, there cannot be anything personal in it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-1.htm" title="Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,">Job 22:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Eliphaz answered — </span>Eliphaz, in this chapter, charges Job home with particular facts of cruelty and oppression, which he supposes him to be guilty of, though he cannot allege one proof of them; to which he adds the atrocious crime of atheism, and a denial or disbelief of God’s providence; and this latter he assigns as the reason of Job’s obstinacy in refusing to submit and acknowledge his guilt. He compares his wickedness to that of the mighty oppressors of the antediluvian world; to that of the inhabitants of Sodom and the cities of the plain; not obscurely intimating that his end would probably be the same as theirs, unless prevented by a speedy submission and full restitution; to which he therefore earnestly presses him, and endeavours to allure him by placing full in his view the great advantages he would probably reap from such a conduct. — Heath.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-4 Eliphaz considers that, because Job complained so much of his afflictions, he thought God was unjust in afflicting him; but Job was far from thinking so. What Eliphaz says, is unjustly applied to Job, but it is very true, that when God does us good it is not because he is indebted to us. Man's piety is no profit to God, no gain. The gains of religion to men are infinitely greater than the losses of it. God is a Sovereign, who gives no account of his conduct; but he is perfectly wise, just, faithful, good, and merciful. He approves the likeness of his own holiness, and delights in the fruits of his Spirit; he accepts the thankful services of the humble believer, while he rejects the proud claim of the self-confident.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How then comfort ye me in vain ... - That is, how can you be qualified to give me consolation in my trials, who have such erroneous views of the government and dealings of God? True consolation could be founded only on correct views of the divine government; but such views, Job says, they had not. With their conceptions of the divine administration, they could not administer to him any real consolation. We may learn hence,<p>(1) That all real consolation in trial must be based on correct apprehensions of the divine character and plans. Falsehood, delusion, error, can give no permanent comfort.<p>(2) They whose office it is to administer consolation to the afflicted, should seek after the "truth" about God and his government.<p>They should endeavor to learn why he afflicts people, what purpose he proposes to accomplish, and what are the proper ends of trial. They should have an unwavering conviction that he is right, and should see as far as possible "why" he is right, before they attempt to comfort others. Their own souls should be imbued with the fullest conviction that all the ways of God are holy, and then they should go and endeavor to pour their convictions into other hearts, and make them feel so too. A minister of the gospel, who has unsettled, erroneous, or false views of the character and government of God, is poorly qualified for his station, and will be a "miserable comforter" to those who are in trial. Truth alone sustains the soul in affliction. Truth only can inspire confidence in God. Truth only can break the force of sorrow, and enable the sufferer to look up to God and to heaven with confidence and joy.<p>(The end of Part One of the Commentary on Job) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>THIRD SERIES.<p>Job 22:1-30. As Before, Eliphaz Begins.<p>1. Eliphaz shows that man's goodness does not add to, or man's badness take from, the happiness of God; therefore it cannot be that God sends prosperity to some and calamities on others for His own advantage; the cause of the goods and ills sent must lie in the men themselves (Ps 16:2; Lu 17:10; Ac 17:25; 1Ch 29:14). So Job's calamities must arise from guilt. Eliphaz, instead of meeting the facts, tries to show that it could not be so.Eliphaz’s answer: man’s righteousness profiteth not God; nor can God fear man, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/22-1.htm" title="Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,...">Job 22:1-4</a></span>.

As Eliphaz was the first that entered the discussion with Job, being perhaps the oldest man, and might be reckoned the wisest, so he gives the lead in every course of disputation; and here, instead of replying to Job's arguments and instances, at which he was very angry, betakes himself to calumny and reproach, and to draw invidious consequences, instead of making use of solid reasons for conviction and confutation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-30.</span> - Eliphaz returns to the attack, but with observations that are at first strangely pointless and irrelevant, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> on the unprofitableness of man to God (vers. l, 2), and on the slight importance of Job's case (ver. 3). After this weak prelude, however, there is more vigour in his assault. In vers. 4-9 he directly charges Job with a number of specified sins, and in vers. 10, 11 declares his sufferings to be the consequence of them. He then proceeds to accuse him of denying God's omniscience (vers. 12-14), and, alter some not very successful attempts to retort on him his own words (vers. 15-20), finally recurs to his favourite devices (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17-26</a>) of exhorting Job to submission and repentance, and promising him restoration to God's favour and a return of prosperity (vers. 21-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, Can a man be profitable unto God?</span> Job had <span class="accented">said</span> nothing upon this point; but perhaps Eliphaz thinks his complaints and expostulations to <span class="accented">imply</span> a higher value in man, and a greater claim to consideration at God's hands, than can rightly be challenged. Certainly God does not depend on man for profit or advantage of any kind. Neither our wisdom nor our goodness "extendeth to him."

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, which is the antecedent to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-29.htm">Job 21:29</a>, beginning with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm">Job 19:28</a>), he refers to words of the friends like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-22.htm">Job 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-15.htm">Job 18:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>. &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489; is prop. the noble man, whose heart impels (&#1504;&#1491;&#1489;, Arab. nadaba) him to what is good, or who is ready and willing, and does spontaneously that which is good (Arab. naduba), vid., Psychol. S. 165; then, however, since the notion takes the reverse way of generosus, the noble man (princely) by birth and station, with which the secondary notion of pride and abuse of power, therefore of a despot or tyrant, is easily as here (parall. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, comp. &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, with the same word in the parallel) combined (just so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>, and similarly at least above, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-21.htm">Job 12:21</a>, - an anomaly of name and conduct, which will be for the future put aside, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-5.htm">Isaiah 32:5</a>). It is not admissible to understand the double question as antithetical, with Wolfson, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-11.htm">Proverbs 14:11</a>; for the interrogative &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is not appropriate to the house of the &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;, in the proper sense of the word. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is not an externally but internally multiplying plur.; perhaps the poet by byt intends a palace in the city, and by &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; a tent among the wandering tribes, rendered prominent by its spaciousness and the splendour of the establishment.<p>(Note: Although the tents regularly consist of two divisions, one for the men and another for the women, the translation "magnificent pavilion" (Prachtgezelt), disputed by Hirz., is perfectly correct; for even in the present day a Beduin, as he approaches an encampment, knows the tent of the sheikh immediately: it is denoted by its size, often also by the lances planted at the door, and also, as is easily imagined, by the rich arrangement of cushions and carpets. Vid., Layard's New Discoveries, pp. 261 and 171.)<p>Job thinks the friends reason a priori since they inquire thus; the permanent fact of experience is quite different, as they can learn from &#1506;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, travellers, i.e., here: people who have travelled much, and therefore are well acquainted with the stories of human destinies. The Piel &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, proceeding from the radical meaning to gaze fixedly, is an enantio'seemon, since it signifies both to have regard to, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>, and to disown, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>; here it is to be translated: their &#1488;&#1514;&#1514; ye cannot nevertheless deny, ignore (as Arab. nakira and ankara). &#1488;&#1514;&#1514; are tokens, here: remarkable things, and indeed the remarkable histories related by them; Arab. a&#770;yatun (collective plur. a&#770;yun), signs, is also similarly used in the signification of Arab. &#8219;ibrat, example, historical teaching.<p>That the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, introduces the view of the friends, and is the antecedent clause to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-31.htm">Job 21:31</a> : quod (si) vos dicitis, in tempora cladis per iram divinam immissae servari et nescium futuri velut pecudem eo deduci improbum (Bttcher, de fin. 76), has in the double &#1500; an apparent support, which is not to be denied, especially in regard to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-23.htm">Job 38:23</a>; it is, however, on account of the omission of the indispensable &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493; in this instance, an explanation which does violence to the words. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, on the contrary, introduces that which the accounts of the travellers affirm. Further, the &#1500; in &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; indicates here not the terminus ad quem, but as in &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, in the evening, the terminus quo. And the verb &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;, cohibere, signifies here to hold back from danger, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-18.htm">Job 33:18</a>, therefore to preserve uninjured. Ew. translates <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a> erroneously: "in the day when the floods of wrath come on." How tame would this &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, "to be led near," be! This Hoph. signifies elsewhere to be brought and conducted, and occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a> and elsewhere, of an honourable escort; here, in accordance with the connection: to be led away out of the danger (somewhat as Lot and his family by the escort of angels). At the time, when streams of wrath (&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;, the overflowing of vexation  equals  outburst of wrath, like the Arab. &#8219;abrt, the overflowing of the eye  equals  tears) go forth, they remain untouched: they escape them, as being under a special, higher protection.<p>continued...</body></html>
