The "arm," in the Scriptures, is the symbol of power; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-15.htm">Psalm 10:15</a>, "Break thou the arm of the wicked;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-21.htm">Ezekiel 30:21</a>. "I have broken the arm of Pharaoh;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-13.htm">Psalm 89:13</a>, "Thou hast a mighty arm;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/97-1.htm">Psalm 97:1</a>, "His holy arm hath gotten him the victory." The reason of this is, that the sword and spear were principally used in war, and success depended on the force with which they were wielded by the arm. There can be no doubt that this is intended to be applied to Job, and that the meaning is, that he had driven the poor from their possessions, and he had taken forcible occupancy of what belonged to them. The idea is, that he had done this by power, not by "right."<p>Had the earth - Took possession of the land, and drove off from it those to whom it belonged, or who had an equal right to it with him.<p>And the honorable man - Margin, "eminent," or "accepted of countenance." Hebrew: "Lifted up of countenance;" that is, the man whose countenance was elevated either by honor or pride. It may be used to describe either; but, perhaps, there is more force in the former, in saying that it was the great man, the man of rank and office, who had got possession. There is, thus, some sarcasm in the severe charge: "The great man ... the man of rank, and wealth, and office, has got possession, while the humble and poor are banished." Job had had great possessions; but this charge as to the manner in which he had acquired them seems to be wholly gratuitous. Eliphaz takes it for granted, since he was so severely punished, that it "must have been" in some such way. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. mighty&#8212;Hebrew, "man of arm" (Ps 10:15; namely, Job).<p>honourable&#8212;Hebrew, "eminent, or, accepted for countenance" (Isa 3:3; 2Ki 5:1); that is, possessing authority. Eliphaz repeats his charge (Job 15:28; so Zophar, Job 20:19), that it was by violence Job wrung houses and lands from the poor, to whom now he refused relief (Job 22:7, 9) [Michaelis].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Heb. <span class="ital">And</span>, or <span class="ital">but, the man of arm</span>, or <span class="ital">strength</span>, or, <span class="ital">power</span>, <span class="ital">to him was the earth</span>, or <span class="ital">the land</span>. i.e. he had the firm possession or free enjoyment of it: which is meant either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

A large share and portion of it, which Job could not hinder him from the enjoyment of, because mightier than he, or otherwise he would have done it; or Job was content he should have what he had, and gave him more than what of right belonged to him; for when any cause came before him as a judge, or civil magistrate, between a rich man, and a poorer man, relating to a field, or piece of land he always gave the cause to the rich and mighty and so he had the land, as is suggested: <p>and the honourable man dwelt in it; peaceably, quietly, and undisturbed, though he had no just title to it; or "the man accepted of face" or "countenance" (q), who was respected because of his outward circumstances, wealth and riches, power and authority; and so Job is tacitly charged with being a respecter of persons in judgment, which was not good; and in general these phrases denote partiality in him, that he was favourable to the mighty and powerful, and unkind and cruel to the poor and needy. Some (r) understand all this of Job himself, that because he was the mighty man, or "man of arms" (s), he made use of his power and might, and stretched out his arm, and grasped and got into his possession, by force and violence, the houses, and lands, and estates of others, and became the greatest man in all the east, and the earth in a manner was his alone; and because he was respected for his greatness and riches, he was confirmed therein, and dwelt securely: or rather, taking the words in this sense, they may be considered as an aggravation of Job's sins, both before and after charged upon him; as that when he was the mighty and honourable man, and though he was such, and had it in the power of his hands to do a great deal of good to the poor and needy; yet took a pledge from his indigent brother, stripped those that were almost naked of their clothing, and would not give a poor weary traveller a cup of water, nor a morsel of bread to an hungry man; yea, abused his power and authority which he had, to the oppression of the widow and fatherless, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-9.htm">Job 22:9</a>. <p>(q)  "acceptus faciebus", Montanus; "vel facie", Vatablus, Beza, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Drusius, Mercerus.

Thes.): it signifies originally, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, Arab. skn, to rest, dwell, especially to dwell beside one another, then to become accustomed to one another (comp. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, a neighbour, and Arab. sakanun, a friend, confidant), and to assist one another, to be serviceable, to be profitable; we can say both &#1505;&#1499;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, I have profit, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-9.htm">Job 34:9</a>, and &#1505;&#1499;&#1503;, it is profitable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-3.htm">Job 35:3</a>, here twice with a personal subj., and first followed by &#1500;, then with the &#1506;&#1500; usual also elsewhere in later prose (e.g., &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>, comp. supra, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>, to be pleasant) and poetry, which gladly adopts Aramaisms (as here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;, well-pleased), instead of &#1500;, whence here &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>, pathetic for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;.

On the Aramaizing doubling of the first radical in the Hiph. &#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; (instead of &#1514;&#1514;&#1501;), vid., Ges. 67, rem. 8, comp. 3. It is translated an lucrum (ei) si integras facias vias tuas. The meaning of the whole strophe is mainly determined according to the rendering of &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; (like &#1492;&#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-26.htm">Job 39:26</a>, with Dech, and as an exception with Munach, not removed to the place of the Metheg; vid., Psalter, ii. 491, Anm. 1). If the suff. is taken objectively (from fear of thee), e.g., Hirz., we have the following line of thought: God is neither benefited by human virtue nor injured by human sin, so that when He corrects the sinner He is turning danger from himself; He neither rewards the godly because He is benefited by his piety, nor punishes the sinner because by his sinning he threatens Him with injury. Since, therefore, if God chastises a man, the reason of it is not to be found in any selfish purpose of God, it must be in the sin of the man, which is on its own account worthy of punishment. But the logical relation in which <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5</a> stands to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-4.htm">Job 22:4</a> does not suit this: perhaps from fear of thee ... ? no, rather because of thy many and great sins! Hahn is more just to this relation when he explains: "God has no personal profit to expect from man, so that, somewhat from fear, to prevent him from being injurious, He should have any occasion to torment him with sufferings unjustly." But if the personal profit, which is denied, is one that grows out of the piety of the man, the personal harm, which is denied as one which God by punishment will keep far from Himself, is to be thought of as growing out of the sin of the man; and the logical relation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-4.htm">Job 22:4</a> is not suited to this, for. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5</a> assigns the reason of the chastisement to the sin, and denies, as it runs, not merely any motive whatever in connection with the sin, but that the reason can lie in the opposite of sin, as it appears according to Job's assertion that, although guiltless, he is still suffering from the wrath of God.<p>Thus, then, the suff. of &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; is to be taken subjectively: on account of thy fear of God, as Eliphaz has used &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; twice already, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-6.htm">Job 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-4.htm">Job 15:4</a>. By this subjective rendering <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-4.htm">Job 22:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5</a> form a true antithesis: Does God perhaps punish thee on account of thy fear of God? Does He go (on that account) with thee into judgment? No (it would be absurd to suppose that); therefore thy wickedness must be great (in proportion to the greatness of thy suffering), and thy misdeeds infinitely many. If we now look at what precedes, we shall have to put aside the thought drawn into <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-3.htm">Job 22:3</a> by Ewald (and also by Hahn): whether God, perhaps with the purpose of gaining greater advantage from piety, seeks to raise it by unjustly decreed suffering; for this thought has nothing to indicate it, and is indeed certainly false, but on account of the force of truth which lies in it (there is a decreeing of suffering for the godly to raise their piety) is only perplexing.<p>First of all, we must inquire how it is that Eliphaz begins his speech thus. All the exhortations to penitence in which the three exhaust themselves, rebound from Job without affecting him. Even Eliphaz, the oldest among them, full of a lofty, almost prophetic consciousness, has with the utmost solicitude allured and terrified him, but in vain. And it is the cause of God which he brings against him, or rather his own well-being that he seeks, without making an impression upon him. Then he reminds him that God is in Himself the all-sufficient One; that no advantage accrues to Him from human uprightness, since His nature, existing before and transcending all created things, can suffer neither diminution nor increase from the creature; that Job therefore, since he remains inaccessible to that well-meant call to penitent humiliation, has refused not to benefit Him, but himself; or, what is the reverse side of this thought (which is not, however, expressed), that he does no injury to Him, only to himself. And yet in what except in Job's sin should this decree of suffering have its ground? If it is a self-contradiction that God should chastise a man because he fears Him, there must be sin on the side of Job; and indeed, since the nature of the sin is to be measured according to the nature of the suffering, great and measureless sin. This logical necessity Eliphaz now regards as real, without further investigation, by opening out this bundle of sins in the next strophe, and reproaching Job directly with that which Zophar, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-19.htm">Job 20:19-21</a>, aiming at Job, has said of the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. In the next strophe he continues, with &#1499;&#1497; explic.: </body></html>
