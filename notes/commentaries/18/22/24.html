The sense probably is, “Put thy treasure on a level with the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks”: that is, reckon it of no more value than such stones; do not set thine heart upon it. The situation of Ophir has always been a matter of dispute. Josephus placed it in India (<span class= "ital">Antt. viii.</span> 6<span class= "ital">, </span>§ 4), as do some moderns; others suppose it to have been an Indian colony in Southern Arabia, and others have placed it on the east coast of Africa.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/22-24.htm" title="Then shall you lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks....">Job 22:24-25</a>. </span><span class="ital">Then shalt thou lay up gold — </span>The word <span class="greekheb">בצר</span>, <span class="ital">batzer, </span>here rendered <span class="ital">gold, </span>is a word of dubious meaning.

Thus interpreted the sense is, <span class="ital">The Almighty shall be thy gold, and silver of strength to thee; </span>which translation is perfectly agreeable to the Hebrew. On this the same pious author observes, “Worldlings make gold their god; saints make God their gold: they that are enriched with his favour and grace may truly be said to have abundance of the best gold, and best laid up.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:21-30 The answer of Eliphaz wrongly implied that Job had hitherto not known God, and that prosperity in this life would follow his sincere conversion. The counsel Eliphaz here gives is good, though, as to Job, it was built upon a false supposition that he was a stranger and enemy to God. Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient. Let us examine whether there may not be some colour for the slander, and walk watchfully, so as to be clear of all appearances of evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust - Margin, or, "on the dust." Dr. Good renders this, "Thou shalt then count thy treasure as dust" - implying that he would have much of it. Noyes, "Cast to the dust thy gold" - implying that he would throw his gold away as of no account, and put his dependence on God alone. Kim-chi, and, after him, Grotius, suppose that it means, "Thy gold thou shalt regard no more than dust, and gold of Ophir no more than the stones of the brook; God shall be to thee better than gold and silver." The editor of the Pictorial Bible supposes that there is here a distinct reference to the sources from which gold was for merly obtained, as being washed down among the stones of the brooks. The word rendered "gold" here &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;  betser is from &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;  ba&#770;tsar - to cut off, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/76-12.htm">Psalm 76:12</a>, and was properly applied to the ore of precious metals in the rude state, as cut or dug out of mines.<p>Hence, it properly refers to the metals in their crude state, and before they were subjected to the fire. Then it comes to mean precious metals, and is parallel with gold of Ophir in the other hemistich. The word occurs only in the following places; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-19.htm">Job 36:19</a>, where it is rendered "gold," and <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-25.htm">Job 22:25</a>, where it is rendered "defense." The literal translation here would be, "Cast to the dust the precious metals; on the stones of the brooks (the gold of) Ophir." The Vulgate renders it, "He shall give for earth flint, and for flint golden torrents." The Septuagint, "Thou shalt be placed on a mount in a rock, and as a rock of the torrent of Ophir." Chaldaen: "And thou shalt place upon the dust thy strong tower &#1514;&#1511;&#1497;&#1507; &#1499;&#1512;&#1498;, and as a rock of the torrents the gold of Ophir." The word here is probably synonymous with "precious treasure," whether consisting in gold or silver; and the idea is, that he should cast to the dust all that treasure, or regard it as valueless; that he should cease to make it an object of solicitude to gain it, and "then" the Almighty would be to him a treasure of more value than gold. According to this, the idea is, not that he would be recompensed with gold and silver as the consequence of returning to God, but that God would afford him more happiness than he had found in the wealth which he had sought, and on which Eliphaz supposed his heart had been set. He regarded Job as covetous of property, as mourning over that which he had lost, and he entreats him now to cease to grieve on account of that, and to come and put his trust in God.<p>And the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks - Or, rather, "Cast the gold of Ophir to the stones of the valley, or let it remain in its native valley among the stones of the brook, as of no more value than they are." There is, probably, allusion here to the fact, that gold was then commonly found in such places, as it is often now. It was washed down by mountain torrents, and lodged among the stones of the valley, and was thence collected, and the sand being washed out, the gold remained. Ophir is uniformly mentioned in the Scriptures as a place abounding in gold, and as well known; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-18.htm">2 Chronicles 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-4.htm">1 Chronicles 29:4</a>. Much perplexity has been felt in reference to its situation, and the difficulty has not been entirely removed. In regard to the opinions which have been held on the point, the reader may consult the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>, the note in the Pictorial Bible on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>, and the Dissertation of Martin Lipenius "de Ophir," in Ugolin's Thesaur. Sacr. Ant. Tom. vii. pp. 262-387; also, the Dissertation of John C. Wichmanshausen, "de navigatione Ophiritica," and Reland's Dissertation "de Ophir" in the same volume. From the mention of this place at a period so early as the time of Job, it is reasonable to suppose that it was not a very remote region, as there is no evidence that voyages were made then to distant countries, or that the knowledge of geography was very extensive. The presumption would be, that it was in the vicinity of Arabia. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Rather, containing the protasis from the last clause of Job 22:23, "If thou regard the glittering metal as dust"; literally, "lay it on on the dust"; to regard it of as little value as the dust on which it lies.

Heeren thinks it a general name for the rich countries of the South, on the African, Indian, and especially the Arabian coast (where was the port Aphar.

It is curious that the natives of Malacca still call their mines Ophirs.<p>stones of the brooks&#8212;If thou dost let the gold of Ophir remain in its native valley among the stones of the brooks; that is, regard it as of little worth as the stones, &c.

No indeed, just this is an exceedingly powerful effect, that Eliphaz describes those godless ones who dismiss God with &#1505;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;, to whom, according to Job's assertion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>., undimmed prosperity is portioned out, by referring to a memorable fact as that which has fallen under the strict judgment of God; and that with the very same words with which Job, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-16.htm">Job 21:16</a>, declines communion with such prosperous evil-doers: "the counsel of the wicked be far from me," he will have nothing more to do, not with the wicked alone, but, with a side glance at Job, even with those who place themselves on a level with them by a denial of the just government of God in the world. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1500;, as the following circumstantial clause shows, is intended like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-20.htm">Job 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-12.htm">Isaiah 26:12</a> : how can the Almighty then help or profit them? Thus they asked, while He had filled their houses with wealth - Eliphaz will have nothing to do with this contemptible misconstruction of the God who proves himself so kind to those who dwell below on the earth, but who, though He is rewarded with ingratitude, is so just. The truly godly are not terrified like <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-8.htm">Job 17:8</a>, that retributive justice is not to be found in God's government of the world; on the contrary, they rejoice over its actual manifestation in their own case, which makes them free, and therefore so joyous. </body></html>
