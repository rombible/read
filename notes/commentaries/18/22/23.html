Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a> &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511; is not perf. Pual for &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1511; (Ew. 83, b), for this exchange, contrary to the law of vowels, of the sharp form with the lengthened form is without example; it must at least have been written &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1511; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>). It is fut. Hoph., which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/11-15.htm">Job 11:15</a>, might be &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1511;; here, however, it is with a resolving, not assimilation, of the Jod, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>. The fut. has the signification of the imperfect which it acquires in an historic connection. It is not to be translated: their place became a stream which has flowed away (Hirz.), for the &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; which would be required by such an interpretation could not be omitted; also not: flumen effusum est in fundamentum eorum (Rosenm., Hahn, and others), which would be &#1500;&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;&#1501;, and would still be very liable to be misunderstood; also not: whose foundation was a poured-out stream (Umbr., Olsh.), for then there would be one attributive clause inserted in the other; but: their solid ground became fluid like a stream (Ew., Hlgst., Schlottm.), so that &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;, after the analogy of the verbs with two accusative, Ges. 139, 2, is a so-called second acc. of the obj. which by the passive becomes a nominative (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>), although it might also be an apposition of the following subj. placed first: a stream (as such, like such a one) their solid ground was brought into a river; the ground on which they and their habitations stood was placed under water and floated away: without doubt the flood is intended; reference to this perfectly accords with the patriarchal pre-and extra-Israelitish standpoint of the book of Job; and the generation of the time of the flood (&#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1492;&#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1500;) is accounted in the holy scriptures of the Old and New Testament as a paragon of godlessness, the contemporaries of Noah are the &#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>).<p>Accordingly they are now here also further described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-17.htm">Job 22:17</a>) as those who said to God, "Depart from us," and what could the Almighty do to them (&#1500;&#1502;&#1493; instead of &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which was to be expected, since, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm">Job 19:28</a>, there is a change from the oratio directa to obliqua)! Olshausen explains with Hahn: "with respect to what thou sayest: and what then does the Almighty do to them (for it)? He fills their houses with prosperity, while the counsel of the wicked is far from me (notwithstanding I am unfortunate)." But this explanation is as forced (since &#1493;&#1502;&#1492; without a &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; or &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; standing with it is taken as the word of Job) as it is contrary to the syntax (since the circumstantial clause with &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; is not recognised, and on the other hand &#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, instead of which it ought at least to have been &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, is regarded as such an one). No indeed, just this is an exceedingly powerful effect, that Eliphaz describes those godless ones who dismiss God with &#1505;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;, to whom, according to Job's assertion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>., undimmed prosperity is portioned out, by referring to a memorable fact as that which has fallen under the strict judgment of God; and that with the very same words with which Job, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-16.htm">Job 21:16</a>, declines communion with such prosperous evil-doers: "the counsel of the wicked be far from me," he will have nothing more to do, not with the wicked alone, but, with a side glance at Job, even with those who place themselves on a level with them by a denial of the just government of God in the world. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1500;, as the following circumstantial clause shows, is intended like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-20.htm">Job 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-12.htm">Isaiah 26:12</a> : how can the Almighty then help or profit them? Thus they asked, while He had filled their houses with wealth - Eliphaz will have nothing to do with this contemptible misconstruction of the God who proves himself so kind to those who dwell below on the earth, but who, though He is rewarded with ingratitude, is so just. The truly godly are not terrified like <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-8.htm">Job 17:8</a>, that retributive justice is not to be found in God's government of the world; on the contrary, they rejoice over its actual manifestation in their own case, which makes them free, and therefore so joyous. </body></html>
