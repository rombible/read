It is good for us to mark it, that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we are not, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does here, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The righteous see it, and are glad - see the destruction of the wicked; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-7.htm">Revelation 16:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1-2</a>. This is designed by Eliphaz, probably, not only to state a fact about the righteous of other times who saw the wicked punished, but, also, to vindicate his own conduct and that of his two friends in regard to Job. If the righteous of other times had rejoiced when the wicked were punished, they inferred that it was not improper for them to manifest similar rejoicings when God had overtaken one who was so signally depraved as they supposed Job to be. Their lack of sympathy for him, therefore, they would defend by a reference to the conduct of the people of other times. There is a sense in which good people rejoice when the wicked are detected and punished. It is not:<p>(1) that they rejoice that the sin was committed; nor<p>(2) that they rejoice in misery; nor<p>(3) that they would not rejoice more if the wicked had been righteous, and had escaped suffering altogether.<p>But it is the kind of joy which we have when a murderer, a robber, or a pirate is seized - when a counterfeiter is detected - when a man who prowls around the dwelling at night to murder its inmates is brought to punishment. It is joy, not that the sin was committed, but that the laws are executed; and who should not rejoice in that? We have joy in the character of an upright judge when he impartially and faithfully administers the laws; and why should we not rejoice in God when he does the same? We rejoice in the manifestation of truth and justice among people - why should we not in the exhibition of the same things in God? We rejoice in a police that can ferret out every form of iniquity, and bring offenders to justice; and why should we not rejoice in that government which is infinitely more perfect than any police ever was among people?<p>And the innocent laugh them to scorn - This is another way of saying that they exult or rejoice; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26-27</a>. No consideration can justify people in deriding and mocking those who are subjected to punishment; and it is by no means certain that the speaker meant to refer to such derision. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Triumph of the pious at the fall of the recent followers of the antediluvian sinners. While in the act of denying that God can do them any good or harm, they are cut off by Him. Eliphaz hereby justifies himself and the friends for their conduct to Job: not derision of the wretched, but joy at the vindication of God's ways (Ps 107:42; Re 15:3; 16:7; 19:1, 2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The righteous see it; </span> whom God oft spares in common calamities, and makes them to survive and see the destruction of the wicked; as Noah, Lot, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Are glad; </span> not that they insult over or rejoice in the ruin of any men, but because they delight in the vindication of God’s honour, and justice, and holiness, which is conjoined with the destruction of his enemies, and which is and ought to be dearer to them than all the interests of men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The innocent laugh them to scorn; </span> they justly deride them, for their vain and yet strong confidences, which are now destroyed; and for their profane contempt of God and of his judgments, which now they feel; and for their deep and crafty counsels, which are now frustrated and turned against themselves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The righteous see it, and are glad,.... Not the counsel of the wicked, nor their outward prosperity, but their ruin and destruction, which is sure and certain; though it may sometimes seem to linger, it is often public and visible to the view of every man, being made public examples, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-8.htm">Psalm 91:8</a>; and which is matter of joy and gladness to truly good and righteous men; who have the righteousness of Christ on them, his grace in them, and in consequence of that live soberly, righteously, and godly; these rejoice at the vengeance of God on wicked men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>; not that the misery of their fellow creatures is pleasing to them as such; this would be brutish and inhuman, as well as contrary to the grace of God, and to their character as good men, and also would be displeasing to God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>; but partly because they themselves, through the grace and goodness of God, have been kept from such sins as bring to ruin and destruction; and partly because they are delivered out of the hands of these wicked men, who were distressing to them; and chiefly because of the glory of the divine perfections, particularly the holiness and justice of God displayed herein; for God is known and glorified by the judgments which he executeth, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>; <p>and the innocent laugh them to scorn; such as are upright and sincere, live holy and harmless lives and conversations, though not entirely free from sin; these deride them for their impieties, and observe to them the justness of the divine judgments upon them. The Jewish writers, many of them (f), restrain these words to Noah and his sons, who saw with their eyes the flood that destroyed the world of the ungodly, and rejoiced at it, and in their turn had them in derision, who had made a mock at Noah's building of the ark, and at his exhortations to them; but though the characters of righteous and innocent agree with Noah, who was just and perfect in his generation, yet not with all his sons; and it is best to understand this of good men in general; though it must be observed and owned, that the destruction of the wicked by the flood is before spoken of, and their character described. The word "saying" is by some supplied at the close of this verse, and so the following words are what the righteous are represented as saying, upon sight of the destruction of the wicked. <p>(f) Aben Ezra, Ben Gersom, Sephorno, et alii. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The righteous see <i>it</i>, and are glad: <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</span><p>(n) The just rejoice at the destruction of the wicked for two reasons, first because God shows himself judge of the world and by this means continues his honour and glory: secondly because God shows that he had care over his in that he punished their enemies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>19.&emsp;&emsp;The righteous see it and are glad,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the innocent laugh them to scorn,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>20.&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">Saying</span>, Surely our adversaries are cut off,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And that which they have left the fire hath consumed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The “remnant” of the wicked, or “that which they leave,” is their substance and possessions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">19, 20</span>.

Scorn and derision are the just portion of the wicked, and in Old Testament times even saints did not scruple to pour them out on those who deserved them. But the gospel spirit is different. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  Is not Eloah high as the heavens?<p>See but the head of the stars, how exalted!<p>13  So then thou thinkest: "What doth God know?<p>Can He judge through the thick cloud?<p>14  Clouds veil Him that He seeth not,<p>And in the vault of heaven He walketh at His pleasure."<p>Because Job has denied the distribution of worldly fortune, of outward prosperity and adversity, according to the law of the justice that recompenses like for like, Eliphaz charges him with that unbelief often mentioned in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>), which denies to the God in heaven, as Epicurus did to the gods who lead a blessed life in the spaces between the worlds, a knowledge of earthly things, and therefore the preliminary condition for a right comprehension of them. The mode of expression here is altogether peculiar. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is not acc. loci, as the like accusatives in combination with the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, may be taken: the substantival clause would lead one to expect &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, or better &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>); it is rather (similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>) nomin. praedicati: Eloah is the height of the heavens  equals  heaven-high, as high as the heavens, therefore certainly highly, and indeed very highly, exalted above this earth. In this sense it is continued with Waw explic.: and behold ( equals  behold then) the head of the stars, that, or how (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-15.htm">Genesis 49:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-29.htm">1 Samuel 14:29</a>, quod  equals  quam) exalted they are. &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; has Asla (Kadma) in correct texts, and &#1512;&#1502;&#1493; is written &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (ra&#770;mmu) with a so-called Dag. affectuosum (Olsh. 83, b). It may be received as certain that &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, the head (vertex), beside &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; (not &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;), does not signify the sum (Aben-Ezra). But it is questionable whether the genitive that follows &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is gen. partitivus: the highest among the stars (Ew., Hirz., Schlottm.), or gen. epexegeticus: the head, i.e., (in relation to the rest of the universe) the height, which is formed by the stars, or even which they occupy (Ges. coelum stellatum); the partitive rendering is to be preferred, for the Semitic perception recognises, as the plural &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; implies, nearer and more distant celestial spheres. The expression "head of the stars" is therefore somewhat like fastigium coeli (the extreme height, i.e., the middle of the vault of heaven), or culmen aereum (of the aether separating the strata of air above); the summit of the stars rising up into the extremest spheres is intended (we should say: the fixed stars, or to use a still more modern expression, the milky way), as also the &#1512;&#1502;&#1493; naturally refers to &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; as one notion (summitas astrorum  equals  summa astra).<p>The connection of what follows with Waw is not adversative (Hirz., Ew., and others: and yet thou speakest), it is rather consecutive (Hahn: and since thou speakest; better: and in consequence of this thou speakest; or: thus speakest thou, thinkest thou then). The undeniable truth that God is exalted, and indeed absolute in His exaltation, is misapplied by Job to the false conclusion: what does God know, or (since the perf. in interrogative sentences frequently corresponds to the Latin conjunctive, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a>) how should God know, or take knowledge, i.e., of anything that happens on earth? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13</a> the potential takes the place of this modal perfect: can He rule judicially behind the dark clouds, i.e., over the world below from which He is shut out? &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; (of like verbal origin with the Arab. b&#8219;da, post, prop. distance, separation, succession, but of wider use) signifies here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a>, behind, pone, with the secondary notion of being encompassed or covered by that which shuts off. Far from having an unlimited view of everything earthly from His absolute height, it is veiled from His by the clouds, so that He sees not what occurs here below, and unconcerned about it He walks the circle of the heavens (that which vaults the earth, the inhabitants of which seem to Him, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>, as grasshoppers); &#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; is here, after the analogy of Kal, joined with the accus. of the way over which He walks at His pleasure: orbem coelum obambulat. By such unworthy views of the Deity, Job puts himself on a par with the godless race that was swept away by the flood in ancient days, without allowing himself to be warned by this example of punishment. </body></html>
