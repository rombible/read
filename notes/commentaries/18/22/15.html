As the universal deluge was a most signal and memorable instance of God’s displeasure against wickedness and wicked men, and was, doubtless, very well known in those days, Eliphaz takes occasion to enlarge upon it, for five or six verses together, as a proper lesson (so he thought it) for his friend; and then closes it with the mention of another destruction by fire, either past or to be expected, which is described to be as general and as fatal to the wicked.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:15-20 Eliphaz would have Job mark the old way that wicked men have trodden, and see what the end of their way was. It is good for us to mark it, that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we are not, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does here, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? - Hast thou seen what has happened in former times to wicked people? Job had maintained that God did not deal with people in this world according to their character. To meet this, Eliphaz now appeals to ancient facts, and especially refers to the deluge, when the wicked were cut off by a flood for their sins. Schultens, Dr. Good, Noyes, and Reiske, however, suppose that tbe word here rendered "mark," means to "pursue," or "imitate," and that the sense is," Are you willing to adopt the principles of those wicked people who lived in the time of the deluge?" But the sense is not materially affected. The general design is to refer Job to the case of the impious generation that was swept off by a flood. The judgments of God on them were a full refutation, in his view, of the sentiments of Job. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. marked&#8212;Rather, Dost thou keep to? that is, wish to follow (so Hebrew, 2Sa 22:22).

The evil way that wicked men have walked in ever since man apostatized from God, the way of Cain and his descendants, who were of the wicked one, and lived wicked lives and conversations; "the way of the old world", as Mr. Broughton renders the phrase here, the imagination of the thoughts of whose hearts was evil, and that continually; who filled the earth with rapine and violence, and all flesh corrupted their way with all manner of impurity and wickedness, and indulged themselves in the gratification of their sensual lusts and pleasures; and were, as the Apostle Peter calls them, "the world of the ungodly"; and here, "men of wickedness", or "iniquity" (y); such who gave themselves up to it, and were immersed in it; these trod the paths of sin, and made it a beaten road; they frequented this way, they walked continually in it; their life was a series and course of iniquity, in which they obstinately persisted, and proceeded from evil to evil, to more and more ungodliness. Now Job is asked if he had "marked" this their way and course of life; the evil of their way should have been marked, in order to avoid it; it being an old way should not recommend it; and the end of it, which was sudden ruin and destruction, should be marked to deter from it: but it is suggested that Job kept in this way, and observed it himself, and walked in it; for the words may be rendered, "truly thou keepest the old way", or "the way of the world" (z); trod in the steps of wicked men, was a close follower of them, and companied with them; like manner is Job charged by Elihu, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>; and this sense agrees with what goes before. <p>(y)  "viri iniquitatis", Montanus, Mercerus; so Drusius, Michaelis.

It was under a similar feeling in regard to God that the great sinners before the Flood filled the earth with violence, and Eliphaz asks Job whether he will go the length of accepting the principles and following the conduct of such men? Compare the words of Elihu, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-8.htm" title="Which goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men.">Job 34:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Hast thou marked the old way</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">wilt thou keep</span> …? i. e. follow the path they walked in.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Wilt thou keep the old way</span> etc.? (see the Revised Version). Eliphaz assumes that it is Job's intention to cast in his lot with these persons whose prosperous wickedness he has described in the preceding chapter (vers. 7-15). And this notwithstanding Job's final protest, "Be the counsel of the wicked far from me" (ver. 16). He calls the mode of life pursued by these wicked persons "the old way," either with allusion to the seed of Cain before the Flood, who "corrupted their way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>), or perhaps with reference to the descendants of Nimrod after it (see Professor Lee's 'Book of Job,' p. 361). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The man of the arm, &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;, is in Eliphaz' mind Job himself. He has by degrees acquired the territory far and wide for himself, by having brought down the rightful possessors by open violence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-19.htm">Job 20:19</a>), or even by cunning and unfeeling practices, and is not deterred by any threat of a curse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-28.htm">Job 15:28</a>): &#1500;&#1493; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, he looked upon it as his, and his it must become; and since with his possessions his authority increased, he planted himself firmly in it, filled it out alone, like a stout fellow who takes the room of all others away. Umbr., Hahn, and others think Job's partiality for power and rank is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-8.htm">Job 22:8</a>; but both assertions read straightforward, without any intimation of co-operation. The address is here only suspended, in order to describe the man as he was and is. The all-absorbing love of self regulated his dealings. In possession of the highest power and highest rank, he was not easy of access. Widows and orphans, that they might not perish, were obliged to turn suppliantly to him. But the widows he chased away with empty hands, and the arms of the orphans were crushed. From the address a turn is also here taken to an objective utterance turned from the person addressed, intended however for him; the construction is like &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1506;&#1499;&#1500;, unleavened bread is eaten, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-7.htm">Exodus 13:7</a>, according to Ew. 295, b. The arms are not conceived of as stretched out for help (which would rather be &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;), nor as demanding back their perverted right, but the crushing of the arms, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-17.htm">Psalm 37:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-22.htm">Ezekiel 30:22</a>, and frequently implies a total destruction of every power, support, and help, after the analogy of the Arabic phrase compared by Ges. in his Thes. pp. 268b, 433b. The arm, &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506; (Arab. d&#817;ira&#770;&#8219;, oftener &#8219;ad&#803;ud or sa&#770;&#8219;id), signifies power, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-9.htm">Job 40:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1-11</a> :16; force and violence, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-8.htm">Job 22:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-9.htm">Job 35:9</a>; self-help, and help from without, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-9.htm">Psalm 83:9</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>). Whatever the orphans possessed of goods, honour, and help still available, is not merely broken, it is beaten into fragments. </body></html>
