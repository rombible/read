Happy the men who are blessed with such gifts as these! They have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good, but have great need to watch against pride. Happy the people who are blessed with such men! it is a token for good to them. Here we see what Job valued himself by, in the day of his prosperity. It was by his usefulness. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence of proud and evil men. Good magistrates must thus be a restraint to evil-doers, and protect the innocent; in order to this, they should arm themselves with zeal and resolution. Such men are public blessings, and resemble Him who rescues poor sinners from Satan. How many who were ready to perish, now are blessing Him! But who can show forth His praises? May we trust in His mercy, and seek to imitate His truth, justice, and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I was eyes to the blind - An exceedingly beautiful expression, whose meaning is obvious.

Either in a literal sense: there was a law in Israel against putting a stumbling block before the blind, and a curse pronounced on those that caused them to wander out of the way; which implied that they ought to remove all impediments out of their way, and should lead, guide, and direct them in the right way; and this Job might do, if not in his own person, yet by his servants, and so was as eyes unto them, and especially by taking care of and providing for persons in such circumstances: or rather in a civil sense; such who were in perplexity and distress, oppressed by their neighbours, but did not know how to get justice done them, what steps to take, or methods to pursue, to obtain their right or secure it; these Job instructed with his good advice and counsel, and put them into a way of proceeding whereby they could be extricated out of their difficulties, and peaceably enjoy their own, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-31.htm">Numbers 10:31</a>, and it might be true of him in a spiritual sense; that he was eyes to his blind Heathen neighbours among whom he dwelt; who were ignorant of God, and of the living Redeemer, and of the way of life and salvation by him, and of their miserable and lost estate, and of their need of a Saviour; not being acquainted with the nature of sin, and the sad consequences of it, and with the way of atonement for it, nor with the mind and will of God, and the worship of him; all which he might be a means of enlightening their minds with: Eliphaz owns he instructed many, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-3.htm">Job 4:3</a>; thus ministers of the Gospel are eyes to the blind; for though they cannot give eyes, or spiritual sight to men, which is only from the Lord, yet they may be instruments of opening blind eyes, and of turning men from darkness to light, as the word preached by them is a means of "enlightening the eyes", <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; whereby men come to see their lost estate, and the way of salvation by Christ: <p>and feet was I to the lame; either in a literal sense, as David was to Mephibosheth, when he sent for and maintained him at his own table, so that he had no occasion to seek for his bread elsewhere, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-13.htm">2 Samuel 9:13</a>; and Job might make a provision in some way or another for such sort of persons: or rather in a civil sense, such who were engaged in law suits, and had justice on their side, but for want of friends or money, or both, could not carry them on; these Job supported and supplied, and carried them through their suits, and got their cause for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>.

The Persian kings had officials, whom they called their "eyes" and their "ears" - observers who were to inform them of all that went on in the provinces ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 213). Job acted as "eyes" to the blind of his time, giving them the information which their infirmity hindered them from obtaining. He was also feet to the lame, taking  messages for them, going on their errands, and the like. He was kind and helpful to his fellow-men, not only in great, but also in little matters. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Job came hither to the meeting of the tribunal, or the council of the elders of the city, within which he had a seat and a voice, the young men hid themselves, conscious of his presence (which &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, or, is expressed paratactically instead of as a period), i.e., they retired into the background, since they feared his look of salutation;<p>(Note: Comp. jer. Schekalim ii. 5 (in Pinner's Compendium des Thalmud, S. 58): "R. Jochanan was walking and leaning upon R. Chija bar-Abba, R. Eliezer perceived him and hid himself from him (&#1493;&#1502;&#1496;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1495; &#1502;&#1511;&#1502;&#1497;). Then said R. Jochanan: This Babylonian insulted him (R. Chija) by two things; first that he did not salute him, and then that he hid himself. But R. Jakob bar-Idi answered him, it is the custom with them for the less not to salute the greater, - a custom which confirms Job's words: Young men saw me and his themselves.")<p>and old men (hoary heads) stood up, remained standing (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-19.htm">Job 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-4.htm">Job 28:4</a>). &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; signifies to stand up, &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; to advance towards any one and remain standing.

All stepped back and desisted from speaking before him: The speech of illustrious men (&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, Arab. njd, to be visible, pleasant to the sight, comp. supra, p. 510) hid itself (not daring to be heard), and the tongue of the same clave (motionless) to their palate. We do not translate: as to the voice illustrious men hid themselves, for it is only the appearance produced by the attractional construction Ges. 148, 1 that has led to the rendering of &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as an acc. of closer definition (Schult., Hahn: quod ad vocem eminentium, comprimebantur). The verb is construed with the second member of the genitival expression instead of with the first, as with &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-21.htm">Job 38:21</a>, and with &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12</a>; a construction which occurs with &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; not merely in such exclamatory sentences as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>, but also under other conditions, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-41.htm">1 Kings 1:41</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-6.htm">Job 14:6</a>. This may be best called an attraction of the predicate by the second member of the compound subject, like the reverse instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>; and it is sometimes found even where this second member is not logically the more important. Thus Ew. transl.: "the voice of the nobles hides itself;" whereas Olsh., wrongly denying that the partt. in passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-41.htm">1 Kings 1:41</a>, are to be taken as predicative, wishes to read &#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1488;, which is the more inadmissible, as even the choice of the verb is determined by the attractional construction.<p>The strophe which follows tells how it came to pass that those in authority among the citizens submitted to him, and that on all sides the people were zealous to show him tokens of respect. </body></html>
