And in most similar cases we have need to bear in mind the words of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm" title="Say not you, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for you do not inquire wisely concerning this.">Ecclesiastes 7:10</a>): “Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-1.htm" title="Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,">Job 29:1</a></span>. Job now goes on to finish his defence, and in order to it he first sets forth his condition in the time of his prosperity, against which he places, by way of contrast, his present unhappy situation, describing both with great beauty and elegance. He then proceeds to purge himself of the several crimes laid to his charge, imprecating on himself the divine vengeance, in various manners, in case he were guilty, and at last concludes that this was his plea, on this he would rest his defence: he was desirous it might be recorded, and prays that his cause might be brought to a decision, declaring he was under no manner of apprehensions of the consequences.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-6 Job proceeds to contrast his former prosperity with his present misery, through God's withdrawing from him. A gracious soul delights in God's smiles, not in the smiles of this world. Four things were then very pleasant to holy Job. 1. The confidence he had in the Divine protection. 2. The enjoyment he had of the Divine favour. 3. The communion he had with the Divine word. 4. The assurance he had of the Divine presence. God's presence with a man in his house, though it be but a cottage, makes it a castle and a palace. Then also he had comfort in his family. Riches and flourishing families, like a candle, may be soon extinguished. But when the mind is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, when a man walks in the light of God's countenance, every outward comfort is doubled, every trouble is diminished, and he may pass cheerfully by this light through life and through death. Yet the sensible comfort of this state is often withdrawn for a season; and commonly this arises from sinful neglect, and grieving the Holy Spirit: sometimes it may be a trial of a man's faith and grace. But it is needful to examine ourselves, to seek for the cause of such a change by fervent prayer, and to increase our watchfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover, Job continued his parable - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a>. It is probable that Job had paused to see if anyone would attempt a reply. As his friends were silent, he resumed his remarks and went into a more full statement of his sufferings. The fact that Job more than once paused in his addresses to give his friends an opportunity to speak, and that they were silent when they seemed called upon to vindicate their former sentiments, was what particularly roused the wrath of Elihu and induced him to answer; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2-5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 29<p>Job 29:1-25.<p>1.

Or "added to take it up" (q), that is, he took it up again, and went on with his discourse; he made a pause for awhile, waiting to observe whether any of his three friends would return an answer to what he had said; but perceiving they were not inclined to make any reply, he began again, and gave an account of his former life, in order to show that he was far from being the wicked man, or being so accounted by others, as his friends had represented him: <p>and said; as follows. <p>(q)  "addidit assumere", Montanus, Bolducius, Mercerus; "addidit tollere", Drusius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-25.</span> - From these deep musings upon the nature of true wisdom, and the contrast between the ingenuity and cleverness of man and the infinite knowledge of God, Job turns to another contrast, which he pursues through two chapters (ch. 29. and 30.) - the contrast between what he was and what he is - between his condition in the period of his prosperity and that to which he has been reduced by his afflictions. The present chapter is concerned only with the former period; and gives a graphic description of the life led, in Job's time and country, by a great chieftain, the head of a tribe, not of mere nomads, but of perseus who had attained to a considerable amount of civilization. The picture is one primitive in its features, but not rude or coarse. It is entirely un-Jewish, and has its nearest parallel in some of the early Egyptian records, as the Stele of Beka, and the Instructions of Amen-em-hat ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 11-16; vol. 10. pp. 7-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said</span> (see the comment on Job 27:1). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  It is veiled from the eyes of all living,<p>And concealed from the fowls of heaven.<p>22  Destruction and death say:<p>With our ears we heard a report of it. - <p>23  Elohim understandeth the way to it,<p>And He - He knoweth its place.<p>24  For He looketh to the ends of the earth,<p>Under the whole heaven He seeth.<p>No living created being (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a>) is able to answer the question; even the birds that fly aloft, that have keener and farther-seeing eyes than man, can give us no information concerning wisdom; and the world at least proclaims its existence in a rich variety of its operations, but in the realm of Abaddon and of death below (comp. the combination &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>) it is known only by an indistinct hearsay, and from confused impressions. Therefore: no creature, whether in the realm of the living or the dead, can help us to get wisdom. There is but One who possesses a perfect knowledge concerning wisdom, namely Elohim, whose gave extends to the ends of the earth, and who sees under the whole heaven, i.e., is everywhere present (&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, definition of place, not equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;; comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>), who therefore, after the removal of everything earthly (sub-celestial), alone remains. And why should He with His knowledge, which embraces everything, not also know the way and place of wisdom? Wisdom is indeed the ideal, according to which He has created the world. </body></html>
