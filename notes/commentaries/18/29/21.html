If such an expectation arise from lively faith in the providence and promise of God, it is well; but if from conceit of our own wisdom, and dependence on changeable, earthly things, it is ill grounded, and turns to sin. Every one that has the spirit of wisdom, has not the spirit of government; but Job had both. Yet he had the tenderness of a comforter. This he thought upon with pleasure, when he was himself a mourner. Our Lord Jesus is a King who hates iniquity, and upon whom the blessing of a world ready to perish comes.

His charity relieved the bodily and spiritual wants of others - eyes to the blind (&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; with Pathach), feet to the lame. A father was he to the needy, which is expressed by a beautiful play of words, as if it were: the carer for the care-full ones; or what perhaps corresponds to the primary significations of &#1488;&#1489; and &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;:<p>(Note: There is an old Arabic defective verb, bayya, which signifies "to seek an asylum for one's self," e.g., ana&#770; baj, I come as one seeking protection, a suppliant, in the usual language synon. of Arab. dachala, and thereby indicating its relationship to the Hebr. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, perhaps the root of &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), the &#1514; of which would then not be a radical letter, but, as according to Ges. Thes. in &#1494;&#1497;&#1514;, used only in the forming of the word, and the original meaning would be "a refuge." Traced to a secondary verb, &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; (properly to take up the fugitive, qabila-l-b&#305;&#770;ja) springing from this primitive verb, &#1488;&#1489; would originally signify a guardian, protector; and from the fact of this name denoting, according to the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, properly in general the protecting power, the ideal femin. in &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; (Arab. abawa&#770;t' and the Arabic dual abawain (properly both guardians), which embraces father and mother, would be explained and justified. Thus the rare phenomenon that the same &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; signifies in Hebr. "to be willing," and in Arab. "to refuse," would be solved. The notion of taking up the fugitive would have passed over in the Hebrew, taken according to its positive side, into the notion of being willing, i.e., of receiving and accepting (&#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, qabila, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-8.htm">1 Kings 20:8</a>, &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1506;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  la taqbal); in the Arabic, however, taken according to its negative side, as refusing the fugitive to his pursuer, into that of not being willing; and the usage of the language favours this: aba&#770;hu &#8219;aleihi, he protected him against (Arab. 'la&#770;) the other (refused him to the other); Arab. ab&#305;&#770;yun  equals  ma'bin, protected, inaccessible to him who longs for it; Arab. ibyat, the protection, i.e., the retention of the milk in the udder. Hence &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, from the Hebrew signif. of the verb, signifies one who desires anything, or a needy person, but originally (inasmuch as &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; is connected with Arab. byy) one who needs protection; from the Arabic signif. of Arab. 'aba&#770;, one who restrains himself because he is obliged, one to whom what he wants is denied. To the Arab. ibja (defence, being hindered) corresponds in form the Hebr. &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, according to which &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>, may be understood of ships, which, with all sails set and in all haste, seek the sheltering harbour before the approaching storm.
