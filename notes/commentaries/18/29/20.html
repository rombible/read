If such an expectation arise from lively faith in the providence and promise of God, it is well; but if from conceit of our own wisdom, and dependence on changeable, earthly things, it is ill grounded, and turns to sin. Every one that has the spirit of wisdom, has not the spirit of government; but Job had both. Yet he had the tenderness of a comforter. This he thought upon with pleasure, when he was himself a mourner. Our Lord Jesus is a King who hates iniquity, and upon whom the blessing of a world ready to perish comes. To Him let us give ear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My glory was fresh in me - Margin, "new." "As we say, the man shall not overlive himself." Umbreit. The idea is, that he was not exhausted; he continued in vigor and strength. The image is probably taken from that suggested in the previous verse - from a tree, whose beauty and vigor were continued by the waters, and by the dew that lay on its branches.<p>And my bow - An emblem of vigor and strength. The ancients fought with the bow, and hence, a man who was able to keep his bow constantly drawn, was an image of undiminished and unwearied vigor; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a> : "But his bow abode in strength."<p>Was renewed in my hand - Margin, as in Hebrew "changed." The meaning is, that it constantly renewed its strength. The idea is taken from a tree, which "changes" by renewing its leaves, beauty, and vigor; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7</a>. The sense is that his bow gathered strength in his hand. The figure is very common in Arabic poetry, many specimens of which may be seen in Schultens in loc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

"Is" or "shall be"; <p>fresh in me; or "new" (g); renewed day by day, having fresh additions made unto it; which was true of Job's temporal honour from among men; as a prince and civil magistrate, he had the honour given him that was due unto him, and this was continually increasing; and also of his spiritual glory, which lay, as every good man's glory does, in the grace of God wrought in him, and in the righteousness of Christ put upon him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>; which grace is renewed and increased in them by the Holy Spirit, and is therefore called the renewing of the Holy Ghost; and which righteousness is revealed "from faith to faith", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>, from a lesser degree of it to a greater: <p>and my bow was renewed in my hand; "is" or "shall be"; meaning either his authority as a civil magistrate, increasing daily to the terror of evildoers, and to the praise, profit, and defence of them that did well; or his strength, as Gersom interprets it, his spiritual strength, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>; where the same word is used as here; so that he grew stronger and stronger in faith and other graces, and went from strength to strength; the bow was a warlike instrument, and required strength to draw it, and is put for it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>. <p>(g) "nova", Mercerus, Piscator, Michaelis, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>.

My strength did not fail. When it seemed on the point of failing, it was secretly and mysteriously "renewed." Some commentators regard vers. 19 and 20 as a portion of the speech begun in ver. 18, and view the verbs, not as past tenses, but as futures (compare the translation of the Revised Version). The general meaning is much the same, whichever of the two views we take. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The blessing (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514; with closely closed penult.) of those who stood on the brink of destruction (&#1488;&#1493;&#1489;&#1491;, interiturus, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-19.htm">Job 31:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>), and owed their rescue to him, came upon him; and the heart of the widow to whom he gave assistance, compensating for the assistance of her lost husband, he filled with gladness (&#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; causative, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a>). For the primary attribute, the fundamental character of his way of thinking and acting, was &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, a holding fast to the will of God, which before everything else calls for sympathizing love (root &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, Arab. s&#803;dq, to be hard, firm, stiff, e.g., rumh-un sadq-un, according to the Kamus: a hard, firm, straight spear), and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, judgment and decision in favour of right and equity against wrong and injustice. Righteousness is here called the garment which he put on (as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/132-9.htm">Psalm 132:9</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>), and right is the robe and turban with which he adorns himself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>); as by Arabian poets noble attributes are also called garments, which God puts on any one, or which any one puts on himself (albasa).<p>(Note: In Beidhwi, if I remember rightly, this expression occurs once, Arab. 'l-tdrr&#8219; blbls 'l-tqwy, i.e., "clothing one's self in the armour of the fear of God.")<p>Righteousness is compared to the &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; (corresponding to the thob, i.e., garment, indusium, of the nomads) which is worn on the naked body, justice to the &#1510;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;, a magnificent turban (corresponding to the kefije, consisting of a thick cotton cloth, and fastened with a cord made of camel's hair), and the magnificent robe (corresponding to the second principal article of clothing, the &#8219;aba&#770;). The lxx, Jer., Syr., and Arab. wrongly refer &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; of the second half of the verse, while, on the contrary, it is said of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, per antanaclasin, that Job put this on, and this in turn put Job on, induit; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, as the usage of the language, as we have it, elsewhere shows, does not signify: it (righteousness) clothed me well (Umbr.), or: adorned me (Ew., Vaih.), also not: it dressed me out (Schlottm.), but only: it put me on as a garment, i.e., it made me so its own, that my whole appearance was the representation of itself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a> and twice in the Chronicles, of the Spirit of Jehovah it is said that He puts on any one, induit, when He makes any one the organ of His own manifestation. </body></html>
