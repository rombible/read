If such an expectation arise from lively faith in the providence and promise of God, it is well; but if from conceit of our own wisdom, and dependence on changeable, earthly things, it is ill grounded, and turns to sin. Every one that has the spirit of wisdom, has not the spirit of government; but Job had both. Yet he had the tenderness of a comforter. This he thought upon with pleasure, when he was himself a mourner. Our Lord Jesus is a King who hates iniquity, and upon whom the blessing of a world ready to perish comes. To Him let us give ear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they waited for me as for the rain - That is, as the dry and thirsty earth waits for the rain. This is a continuation of the beautiful image commenced in the previous verse, and conveys the idea that his counsel was as necessary in the assemblies of people as the rain was to give growth to the seed, and beauty to the landscape.<p>And they opened their mouth wide - Expressive of earnest desire; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-131.htm">Psalm 119:131</a> : "I opened my mouth and panted."<p>As for the latter rain - The early and the latter rains are frequently spoken of in the Scriptures, and in Palestine and the adjacent regions are both necessary to the harvest. The early, or autumnal rains, commence in the latter half of October, or the beginning of November, not suddenly, but by degrees, so as to give the husbandman an opportunity to sow his wheat and barley. The rains come mostly from the west, or southwest, continuing for two or three days at a time, and failing especially during the nights. During the months of November and December, they continue to fall heavily; afterward they return only at longer intervals, and are less heavy; but at no period during the winter do they entirely cease to occur. Rain continues to fall more or less during the month of March, but it is rare after that period. The latter rains denote those which fall in the month of March, and which are so necessary in order to bring forward the harvest, which ripens early in May or June. If those rains fail, the harvest materially suffers, and hence, the expressions in the Scriptures, that "the husbandman waits for that rain;" compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a>. The expression, "the early and the latter rain" seems, unless some material change has occurred in Palestine, not to imply that no rain fell in the interval, but that those rains were usually more copious, or were especially necessary, first for sowing, and then for bringing forward the harvest. In the interval between the "latter" and the "early" rains - between March and October - rain never falls, and the sky is usually serene; see Robinson's Bibl. Researches, vol. ii. pp. 96-100. The meaning here is, that they who were assembled in counsel, earnestly desired Job to speak, as the farmer desires the rain that will bring forward his crop. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

The "early rain" is in autumn and onwards, while the seed is being sown. The "latter rain" is in March, and brings forward the harvest, which ripens in May or June. Between the early and latter rains, some rain falls, but not in such quantities as those rains. Between March and October no rain falls (De 11:14; Jas 5:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As for the rain; </span> as the earth or the husbandman waiteth for the rain, to wit, the former rain, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm" title="That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil.">Deu 11:14</a></span>, because the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">latter rain</span> is here opposed to it: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord.

The former rain, as appears by the following clause, which fell in autumn, about October, after seedtime, in order to nourish and cherish it, and bring it up; now as the husbandman waited for this, was in daily expectation of it, and greatly desired it, and longed for it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>; so the people waited for Job, for his coming into their public assemblies, whether civil or religious, and longed to hear him speak, for their counsel and instruction, for their comfort and direction in all things they stood in need of: <p>and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain; which fell in the spring about March, in the time of harvest, which was of use to fatten the kernals of grain, and make them fuller, and the flour finer; now Job's hearers opened their mouths, as the dry and parched earth gapes for rain; or the husbandman, or the gardener, as the Targum, opens his mouth, and asks and prays for rain; or as a hungry and thirsty man opens his mouth to take in refreshment, or expresses thereby his desire of it; or as persons somewhat deaf open their mouths to hear the better, there being a way through the mouth to the internal ear, as anatomists (h) observe; which lies through the Eustachian tube, out of the palate, to the internal cavity of the ear, called the "concha"; wherefore such persons naturally open their mouths when they would hear attentively; all which expresses the eager desire of Job's hearers after his doctrine, which, like the rain, would be useful, profitable, and edifying to them; their view was not to indulge their curiosity, to please their ears, but to affect their hearts, and instruct their minds. <p>(h) Scheuchzer, ut supra.

His charity relieved the bodily and spiritual wants of others - eyes to the blind (&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; with Pathach), feet to the lame. A father was he to the needy, which is expressed by a beautiful play of words, as if it were: the carer for the care-full ones; or what perhaps corresponds to the primary significations of &#1488;&#1489; and &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;:<p>(Note: There is an old Arabic defective verb, bayya, which signifies "to seek an asylum for one's self," e.g., ana&#770; baj, I come as one seeking protection, a suppliant, in the usual language synon. of Arab. dachala, and thereby indicating its relationship to the Hebr. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, perhaps the root of &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), the &#1514; of which would then not be a radical letter, but, as according to Ges. Thes. in &#1494;&#1497;&#1514;, used only in the forming of the word, and the original meaning would be "a refuge." Traced to a secondary verb, &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; (properly to take up the fugitive, qabila-l-b&#305;&#770;ja) springing from this primitive verb, &#1488;&#1489; would originally signify a guardian, protector; and from the fact of this name denoting, according to the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, properly in general the protecting power, the ideal femin. in &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; (Arab. abawa&#770;t' and the Arabic dual abawain (properly both guardians), which embraces father and mother, would be explained and justified. Thus the rare phenomenon that the same &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; signifies in Hebr. "to be willing," and in Arab. "to refuse," would be solved. The notion of taking up the fugitive would have passed over in the Hebrew, taken according to its positive side, into the notion of being willing, i.e., of receiving and accepting (&#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, qabila, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-8.htm">1 Kings 20:8</a>, &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1506;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  la taqbal); in the Arabic, however, taken according to its negative side, as refusing the fugitive to his pursuer, into that of not being willing; and the usage of the language favours this: aba&#770;hu &#8219;aleihi, he protected him against (Arab. 'la&#770;) the other (refused him to the other); Arab. ab&#305;&#770;yun  equals  ma'bin, protected, inaccessible to him who longs for it; Arab. ibyat, the protection, i.e., the retention of the milk in the udder. Hence &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, from the Hebrew signif. of the verb, signifies one who desires anything, or a needy person, but originally (inasmuch as &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; is connected with Arab. byy) one who needs protection; from the Arabic signif. of Arab. 'aba&#770;, one who restrains himself because he is obliged, one to whom what he wants is denied. To the Arab. ibja (defence, being hindered) corresponds in form the Hebr. &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, according to which &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>, may be understood of ships, which, with all sails set and in all haste, seek the sheltering harbour before the approaching storm.
