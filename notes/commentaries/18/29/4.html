It may be proper, however, to observe, that the word <span class="greekheb">סוד</span>, <span class="ital">sod, </span>here translated <span class="ital">the secret, </span>signifies not only <span class="ital">secret counsels, </span>in which sense it is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm" title="Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.">Amos 3:7</a>, but also <span class="ital">the assembly </span>where such consultations are held, in which latter sense it is used much more frequently, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm" title="O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like to you? or to your faithfulness round about you?">Psalm 89:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm" title="Praise you the LORD.

And in this sense Sol. Jarchi understands it here. Thus interpreted, the meaning of the clause is, <span class="ital">when the society of God, </span>a company of devout persons, assembled in my tabernacle, namely, for divine worship, and other purposes of religion. In these meetings, no doubt, Job presided, and in them he took a great deal of pleasure, and it was no little grief to him to have them intermitted, and the persons that composed them scattered.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-6 Job proceeds to contrast his former prosperity with his present misery, through God's withdrawing from him. A gracious soul delights in God's smiles, not in the smiles of this world. Four things were then very pleasant to holy Job. 1. The confidence he had in the Divine protection. 2. The enjoyment he had of the Divine favour. 3. The communion he had with the Divine word. 4. The assurance he had of the Divine presence. God's presence with a man in his house, though it be but a cottage, makes it a castle and a palace. Then also he had comfort in his family. Riches and flourishing families, like a candle, may be soon extinguished. But when the mind is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, when a man walks in the light of God's countenance, every outward comfort is doubled, every trouble is diminished, and he may pass cheerfully by this light through life and through death. Yet the sensible comfort of this state is often withdrawn for a season; and commonly this arises from sinful neglect, and grieving the Holy Spirit: sometimes it may be a trial of a man's faith and grace. But it is needful to examine ourselves, to seek for the cause of such a change by fervent prayer, and to increase our watchfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As I was in the days of my youth - The word here rendered "youth" (&#1495;&#1512;&#1507;  cho&#770;reph), properly means "autumn - from" (&#1495;&#1512;&#1507;  cha&#770;raph), to "pluck, pull," as being the time when fruits ace gathered. Then it means that which is mature; and the meaning here is probably "mature" or "manly" - "As I was in the days of my ripeness;" that is, of my vigor or strength. The whole passage shows that it does not mean "youth," for he goes on to describe the honor and respect shown to him when in mature life. So the Septuagint - &#x39f;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;  Hote e&#772;me&#772;n epibritho&#772;n hodous - "When I made heavy or laded my ways," an expression referring to autumn as being laden with fruit. So we speak of the spring, the autumn, and the winter of life, and by the autumn denote the maturity of vigor, experience, and wisdom. So the Greeks used the word &#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;  opo&#772;ra, Pindar, Isthm. 2, 7, 8; Nem. 5, 10, Aeschyl. Suppl. 1005, 1022. So Ovid:<p>Excessit Autumnus posito fervore javentae<p>Maturus, mitisque inter juvenemque senemqae;<p>Temperie medius, sparsis per tempora canis.<p>Inde senilis hiems tremulo venit horrida passu.<p>Aut spoliata suos, aut. quos habet, alba capillos.<p>Metam. 15. 200.<p>The wish of Job was, that he might be restored to the vigor of mature life, and to the influence and honors which he had then, or rather, perhaps, it was that they might have a view of what he was then, that they might see from what a height he had fallen, and what cause he had of complaint and grief.<p>When the secret of God was upon my tabernacle - The meaning of this language is not clear, and considerable variety has obtained in the interpretation. The Septuagint renders it, "When God watched over - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  episkope&#772;n epoieito - my house." Vulgate, "When God was secretly in my tabernacle." Noyes, "When God was the friend of my tent." Coverdale renders the whole, "As I stood when I was wealthy and had enough; when God prospered my house." Umbreit, Als noch traulich Gott in meinem Zette weilte - "When God remained cordially in my tent." Herder, "When God took counsel with me in my tent." The word rendered "secret" (&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;  so&#770;d), means a "couch" or "cushion" on which one reclines, and then a divan, or circle of friends sitting together in consultation; see the word explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>. The idea here probably is, that God came into his tent or dwelling as a friend, and that Job was, as it were, admitted to the secrecy of his friendship and to an acquaintance with his plans. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. youth&#8212;literally, "autumn"; the time of the ripe fruits of my prosperity.

Some observe the word for "secret" is used for an "assembly" (s), and take the sense to be, that the assembly of the saints and people of God was in his tabernacle or house; there they met together for religious worship, and where Job had often a comfortable opportunity, and wishes for the same again, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>. <p>(r)  "in autumno dierum mearum", Hottinger.

But even the temporal use of &#1500; in &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; at the turn (of morning, of evening, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-63.htm">Genesis 24:63</a>) cannot be compared, but &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; signifies perficiendo  equals  quum perficeret (as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-29.htm">2 Samuel 18:29</a>, mittendo  equals  quum mitteret), it is a gerundival inf. Ngelsb. S. 197f., 2nd edition); and because it is the past that is spoken of, the modal inf. can be continued in the perf., Ges. 132, rem. 2. The thought that God, when He created the world, appointed fixed laws of equable and salutary duration, he particularizes by examples: He appointed to the wind its weight, i.e., the measure of its force or feebleness; distributed the masses of water by measure; appointed to the rain its law, i.e., the conditions of its development and of its beginning; appointed the way, i.e., origin and course, to the lightning (&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1494; from &#1495;&#1494;&#1494;, Arab. h&#803;zz, secare). When He thus created the world, and regulated what was created by laws, then He perceived (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468; with He Mappic. according to the testimony of the Masora) it, wisdom, viz., as the ideal of all things; then He declared it, enarravit, viz., by creating the world, which is the development and realization of its substance; then He gave it a place &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; (for which Dderl. and Ewald unnecessarily read &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;), viz., to create the world after its pattern, and to commit the arrangement of the world as a whole to its supreme protection and guidance; then He also searched it out or tested it, viz., its demiurgic powers, by setting them in motion to realize itself.<p>If we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22-31</a> with this passage, we may say: the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is the divine ideal-world, the divine imagination of all things before their creation, the complex unity of all the ideas, which are the essence of created things and the end of their development. "Wisdom," says one of the old theologians,<p>(Note: Vid., Jul. Hamberger, Lehre Jak. Bhme's, S. 55.)<p>"is a divine imagination, in which the ideas of the angels and souls and all things were seen from eternity, not as already actual creatures, but as a man beholds himself in a mirror." It is not directly one with the Logos, but the Logos is the demiurg by which God has called the world into existence according to that ideal which was in the divine mind. Wisdom is the impersonal model, the Logos the personal master-builder according to that model. Nevertheless the notions, here or in the alter cognate portion of Scripture, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>, are not as yet so distinct as the New Testament revelation of God has first of all rendered possible. In those days, when God realized the substance of the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, this eternal mirror of the world, in the creation of the world, He also gave man the law, corresponding to which he corresponds to His idea and participates in wisdom. Fearing the supreme Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;) only here in the book of Job, one of the 134 &#1493;&#1491;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., passages, where &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; is not merely to be read instead of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but is actually written),<p>(Note: Vid., Buxtorf's Tiberias, p. 245; comp. Br's Psalterium, p. 133.)<p>and renouncing evil (&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, according to another less authorized mode of writing &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;), - this is man's share of wisdom, this is his relative wisdom, by which he remains in connection with the absolute. This is true human &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, in contrast to all high-flown and profound speculations; comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>, where, in like manner, "fear Jehovah" is placed side by side with "depart from evil," and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>, according to which it is rendered possible &#1505;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, to escape the evil of sin and its punishment by fearing God. "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>) is the symbolum, the motto and uppermost principle, of that Israelitish Chokma, whose greatest achievement is the book of Job. The whole of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-1.htm">Job 28:1</a> is a minute panegyric of this principle, the materials of which are taken from the far-distant past; and it is very characteristic, that, in the structure of the book, this twenty-eighth chapter is the clasp which unites the half of the &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; with the half of the &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and that the poet has inscribed upon this clasp that sentence, "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom." But, moreover, Job's closing speech, which ends in this celebration of the praise of the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, also occupies an important position, which must not be determined, in the structure of the whole.<p>continued...</body></html>
