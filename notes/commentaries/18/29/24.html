If such an expectation arise from lively faith in the providence and promise of God, it is well; but if from conceit of our own wisdom, and dependence on changeable, earthly things, it is ill grounded, and turns to sin. Every one that has the spirit of wisdom, has not the spirit of government; but Job had both. Yet he had the tenderness of a comforter. This he thought upon with pleasure, when he was himself a mourner. Our Lord Jesus is a King who hates iniquity, and upon whom the blessing of a world ready to perish comes.

Dr. Good renders it, "I smiled upon them, and they were gay." Herder, If I laughed at them, they were not offended." Coverdale," When I laughed, they knew well it was not earnest." Schultens, "I will laugh at them, they are not secure." But Rosenmuller, Jun. et Trem., Noyes and Umbreit, accord with the sense given in our common translation. The Hebrew literally is, "Should I laugh upon them, they did not confide;" and, according to Rosenmuller, the meaning is, "Such was the reverence for my gravity, that if at any time I relaxed in my severity of manner, they would scarcely believe it, nor did they omit any of their reverence toward me, as if familiarity with the great should produce contempt." Grotius explains it to mean, "Even my jests, they thought, contained something serious." The word used here, however (&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;  s&#769;a&#770;chaq), means not only to laugh or smile upon, but; to laugh at, or deride; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-22.htm">Job 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-7.htm">Job 39:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-19.htm">Job 22:19</a>. It seems to me, that the sense is that so great was his influence, that he was able to control them even with a smile, without saying a word; that if, when a measure was proposed in debate, he should even smile, though he said nothing, they would have no confidence in it, but would at once abandon it as unwise. No higher influence than this can be well conceived, and this exposition accords with the general course of remark, where Job traces along the various degrees of his influence until he comes to this, the highest of them all.<p>And the light of my countenance they cast not down - His smile of favor on an undertaking, or his smile at the weakness or lack of wisdom of any thing proposed, they could not resist. It settled the matter. They had not power by their arguments or moral courage to resist him even if he did not say a word, or even to change the aspect of his countenance. A look, a token of approbation or disapprobation from him, was enough. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. When I relaxed from my wonted gravity (a virtue much esteemed in the East) and smiled, they could hardly credit it; and yet, notwithstanding my condescension, they did not cast aside reverence for my gravity. But the parallelism is better in Umbreit's translation, "I smiled kindly on those who trusted not," that is, in times of danger I cheered those in despondency. And they could not cast down (by their despondency) my serenity of countenance (flowing from trust in God) (Pr 16:15; Ps 104:15). The opposite phrase (Ge 4:5, 6). "Gravity" cannot well be meant by "light of countenance."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If I laughed on them, </span> or sported or jested with them, i.e. carried myself familiarly and pleasantly with them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They believed it not; </span> it was so acceptable to them to see me well-pleased with them, that they could scarce believe their eyes and ears that it was so: compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-26.htm" title="And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt.

Not that he at any time laughed at them, by way of derision; but when in a cheerful frame of mind, or in a merry mood, he used freedom and familiarity, and jested with them; but they could not believe that he did jest, or was in jest, he being a man always of such gravity and seriousness, that they concluded the smile on his countenance, and the pleasant turn of his expression, had a serious meaning in them; or such familiarity with them was so pleasing to them, that they could scarcely for joy believe that he did condescend to indulge such an air of pleasantry: or as Mr. Broughton renders it, and so some others to the same sense, "they would not be bold" (i); familiarity with them did not breed contempt, as it sometimes does; they did not presume upon it, and grow bold and insolent, and make him their equal, and jest with him again; but still there was an awe upon them, and they behaved with reverence to him; and to show how great it was is the design of the expression: <p>and the light of my countenance they cast not down; they did not ruffle his mind, or disturb the serenity of it; or cause him to change his countenance, through any bold and indecent behaviour towards him, encouraged by the freedom and pleasantry he used with them; they did not put him to shame, or provoke him to anger and displeasure by any unbecoming deportment; they kept their distance, they did not detract from his authority and majesty, or in the least lessen that, but behaved with the same reverence and regard to him they ever did; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-6.htm">Genesis 4:6</a>. <p>(i)  "non tamen sibi sumebant audaciam", Michaelis; "neque tam audaces fiunt", Reimar apud Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>If</i> I <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> laughed on them, they believed <i>it</i> not; and the light of my countenance they <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> cast not down.</span><p>(q) That is, they thought it not to be a rest, or they did not think that I would condescend to them.<p>(r) They were afraid to offend me and cause me to be angry.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>.

The calculation of the immense total of grains of sand (atoms) in the world was, as is known, a favourite problem of antiquity; and in the Old Testament Scriptures, the comprehensive knowledge of Solomon is compared to "the sand upon the sea-shore," <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a>, - how much more readily a long life reduced to days! comp. Ovid, Metam. xiv. 136-138; quot haberet corpora pulvis, tot mihi natales contingere vana rogavi. We would willingly decide in favour of this rendering, which is admissible in itself, although a closer definition like &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; is wanting by &#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, if an extensive Jewish tradition did not secure the signification of an immortal bird, or rather one rising ever anew from the dead. The testimony is as follows: (1) b. Sanhedrin 108b, according to which &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; is only another name for the bird &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488;,<p>(Note: The name is a puzzle, and does not accord with any of the mythical birds mentioned in the Zendavesta (vid., Windischmann, Zoroastrische Studien, 1863, S. 93). What Lewysohn, Zoologie des Talmuds, S. 353, brings forward from the Greek by way of explanation is untenable. The name of the bird, Vresha, in an obscure passage of the Bundehesch in Windischmann, ib. S. 80, is similar in sound. Probably, however, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; is one and the same word as Simurg, which is composed of si ( equals  sin) and murg, a bird (Pehlvi and Parsi mru). This si (sin) corresponds to the Vedic jena, a falcon, and in the Zend form, ana (na), is the name of a miraculous bird; so that consequently Simurg  equals  Sinmurg, Parsi Cnamru, signifies the Si- or Cna-bird (comp. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers, 1859, S. 125). In &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; the two parts of the composition seem to be reversed, and &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; to be corrupted from &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;. Moreover, the Simurg is like the phoenix only in the length of its life; another mythological bird, Kuknus, on the other hand (vid., the art. Phnix in Ersch u. Gruber), resembles it also in rising out of its own ashes.)<p>of which the fable is there recorded, that when Noah fed the beasts in the ark, it sat quite still in its compartment, that it might not give more trouble to the patriarch, who had otherwise plenty to do, and that Noah wished it on this account the reward of immortality (&#1497;&#1492;&#1488; &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1488; &#1491;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;).   (2) That this bird &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; is none other than the phoenix, is put beyond all doubt by the Midrashim (collected in the Jalkut on Job, 517). There it is said that Eve gave all the beasts to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree, and that only one bird, the &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; by name, avoided this death-food: "it lives a thousand years, at the expiration of which time fire springs up in its nest, and burns it up to about the size of an egg;" or even: that of itself it diminishes to that size, from which it then grows up again and continues to live (&#1493;&#1495;&#1493;&#1494;&#1512; &#1493;&#1502;&#1514;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;).   (3) The Masora observes, that &#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; occurs in two different significations (&#1489;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;), since in the present passage it does not, as elsewhere, signify sand. (4) Kimchi, in his Lex., says: "in a correct Jerusalem MS I found the observation: &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1511; &#1500;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; &#1493;&#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;, i.e., &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; according to the Nehardean (Babylonian) reading, &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; according to the western (Palestine) reading;" according to which, therefore, the Babylonian Masoretic school distinguished &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; in the present passage from &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>, even in the pronunciation. A conclusion respecting the great antiquity of this lexical tradition may be drawn (5) from the lxx, which translates &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, whence the Italic sicut arbor palmae, Jerome sicut palma.<p>If we did not know from the testimonies quoted that &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; is the name of the phoenix, one might suppose that the lxx has explained &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; according to the Arab. nachl, the palm, as Schultens does; but by a comparison of those testimonies, it is more probable that the translation was &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3be; originally, and that &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is an interpolation, for &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3be; signifies both the immortal miraculous bird and the inexhaustibly youthful palm.<p>(Note: According to Ovid, Metam. xv. 396, the phoenix makes its nest in the palm, and according to Pliny, h. n. xiii. 42, it has its name from the palm: Phoenix putatur ex hujus palmae argumento nomen accepisse, iterum mori ac renasci ex se ipsa; vid., A. Hahmann, Die Dattelpalme, ihre Namen und ihre Verehrung in der alten Welt, in the periodical Bonplandia, 1859, Nr. 15, 16. Masius, in his studies of nature, has very beautifully described on what ground "the intelligent Greek gave a like name to the fabulous immortal bird that rises again out of its own ashes, and the palm which ever renews its youth." Also comp. (Heimsdrfer's) Christliche Kunstsymbolik, S. 26, and Augusti, Beitrge zur christl. Kunst-Geschichte und Liturgik, Bd. i. S. 106-108, but especially Piper, Mythologie der christl. Kunst (1847), i.446f.)<p>We have the reverse case in Tertullian, de resurrectione carnis, c. xiii., which explains the passage in Ps; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-13.htm">Psalm 92:13</a>, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3be; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, according to the translation justus velut phoenix florebit, of the ales orientis or avis Arabiae, which symbolizes man's immortality.<p>(Note: Not without reference to Clemens Romanus, in his I. Ep. ad Corinth. c. xxv., according to which the phoenix is an Arabian bird, which lives five hundred years, then dies in a nest which it builds of incense, myrrh, and spices, and leaves behind it the larva of a young bird, which, when grown up, brings the nest with the bones of its father and places it upon the altar of the sun at the Egyptian Heliopolis. The source of this is Herodotus ii. 73) who, however, has an egg of myrrh instead of a nest of myrrh); and Tacitus, Ann. vi. 28, gives a similar narrative. Lactantius gives a different version in his poem on the phoenix, according to which this, the only one of its race, "built its nest in a country that remained untouched by the deluge." The Jewish tragedy writer, Ezekilos, agrees more nearly with the statement of Arabia being the home of the phoenix. In his drama &#x395;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;, a spy sent forward before the pilgrim band of Israel, he states that among other things the phoenix was also seen; vid., my Gesch. der jd. Poesie, S. 219.)<p>continued...</body></html>
