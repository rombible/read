Happy the men who are blessed with such gifts as these! They have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good, but have great need to watch against pride. Happy the people who are blessed with such men! it is a token for good to them. Here we see what Job valued himself by, in the day of his prosperity. It was by his usefulness. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence of proud and evil men. Good magistrates must thus be a restraint to evil-doers, and protect the innocent; in order to this, they should arm themselves with zeal and resolution. Such men are public blessings, and resemble Him who rescues poor sinners from Satan. How many who were ready to perish, now are blessing Him! But who can show forth His praises? May we trust in His mercy, and seek to imitate His truth, justice, and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The princes refrained talking - As a mark of respect, or in awe of his presence.<p>And laid their hand on their mouth - To lay the finger or the hand on the mouth is every where an action expressive of silence or respect; Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-5.htm">Job 21:5</a>.

Job begins to describe the olden times, that he wishes back, with the virtually genitive relative clause: "when Eloah protected me" (Ges. 116, 3). It is impossible to take &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; as Hiph.: when He caused to shine (Targ. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468;); either &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; (Olsh.) or even &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; (Ew. in his Comm.) ought to be read then.

Nevertheless it commends itself still more to refer the suff. of &#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493; to &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>), and to take &#1504;&#1512;&#1493; as a corrective, explanatory permutative: when He, His lamp, shone above my head, as we have translated. One is at any rate reminded of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a> in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>; for as &#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493; corresponds to &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495; there, so &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; corresponds to &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498; in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a> of the same: by His light I walked in darkness (&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; locative  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;), i.e., rejoicing in His light, which preserved me from its dangers (straying and falling).<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-4.htm">Job 29:4</a> &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not a particle of time, but of comparison, which was obliged here to stand in the place of the &#1499;&#1468;, which is used only as a preposition. And &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; (to be written thus, not &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1497; with an aspirated )&#1508; may not be translated "(in the days) of my spring," as Symm. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, Jer. diebus adolescentiae meae, and Targ. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, whether it be that &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; here signifies the point, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769; (from &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, Arab. h&#803;rf, acuere), or the early time (spring time, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, Arab. chrf, carpere). For in reference to agriculture &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; can certainly signify the early half of the year (on this, vid., Genesis, S. 270), inasmuch as sowing and ploughing time in Palestine and Syria is in November and December; wherefore Arab. chr&#305;&#770;f signifies the early rain or autumn rain; and in Talmudic, &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, premature (ripe too early), is the opposite of &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;, late, but the derivatives of &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; only obtain this signification connotative, for, according to its proper signification, &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; (Arab. chr&#305;&#770;f with other forms) is the gathering time, i.e., the time of the fruit harvest (syn. &#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;), while the Hebr. &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; (&#1488;&#1489;) corresponds to the spring in our sense. If Job meant his youth, he would have said &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, or something similar; but as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-5.htm">Job 29:5</a> shows, he meant his manhood, and this he calls his autumn as the season of maturity, or rather of the abundance of fruits (Schult.: aetatem virilem suis fructibus faetum et exuberantum),<p>(Note: The fresh vegetation, indeed, in hotter districts (e.g., in the valley of the Jordan and Euphrates) begins with the arrival of the autumnal rains, but the real spring (comp. Sol 2:11-13) only begins about the vernal equinox, and still later on the mountains. On the contrary, the late summer, &#1511;&#1497;&#1509;, which passes over into the autumn, &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, is the season for gathering the fruit. The produce of the fields, garden fruit, and grapes ripen before the commencement of the proper autumn; some (when the land can be irrigated) summer fruits, e.g., Dhura (maize) and melons, in like manner olives and dates, ripen in autumn. Therefore the translation, in the days of my autumn ("of my harvest"), is the only correct one. If &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; were intended here in a sense not used elsewhere, it might signify, according to the Arabic with h, "(in the days) of my prosperity," or "my power," or even with Arab. ch, "(in the days) of my youthful vigour;" for chara&#770;fa&#770;t are rash words and deeds, charfa&#770;n one who says or does anything rash from lightness, the feebleness of old age, etc. (according to Wetzst., very common words in Syria): &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; or &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, therefore the thoughtlessness of youth, Arab. jahl, i.e., the rash desire of doing something great, which &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; &#1492;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>). But it is most secure to go back to &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, Arab. chrf, carpere, viz., fructus.)<p>continued...</body></html>
