Widows are the common objects of injuries and oppressions, because they are generally unable to defend themselves from the violence of their oppressors, or to offend those who molest them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:7-17 All sorts of people paid respect to Job, not only for the dignity of his rank, but for his personal merit, his prudence, integrity, and good management. Happy the men who are blessed with such gifts as these! They have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good, but have great need to watch against pride. Happy the people who are blessed with such men! it is a token for good to them. Here we see what Job valued himself by, in the day of his prosperity. It was by his usefulness. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence of proud and evil men. Good magistrates must thus be a restraint to evil-doers, and protect the innocent; in order to this, they should arm themselves with zeal and resolution. Such men are public blessings, and resemble Him who rescues poor sinners from Satan. How many who were ready to perish, now are blessing Him! But who can show forth His praises? May we trust in His mercy, and seek to imitate His truth, justice, and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The blessing of him that was ready to perish ... - Of the man who was falsely accused, and who was in danger of being condemned, or of him who was exposed to death by poverty and want.<p>And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy - By becoming her patron and friend; by vindicating her cause, and saving her from the oppressive exactions of others; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

That were ready to perish through the oppression of others, or through want of the necessaries of life, or through false charges brought, and through false witness bore against them, and so liable to a sentence of condemnation to death, or having it passed upon them; but Job taking their part, and searching thoroughly into their cause, not only respited them from destruction, but cleared them from the charges laid against them, and which brought the blessing of those persons on him; who blessed God for him, and blessed him, wished a blessing on him in their prayers to God, who had been such a happy instrument of their deliverance from ruin and destruction; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11</a>; <p>and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy; by relieving her wants, defending her cause, and punishing those that oppressed her; which is the reverse of the character Eliphaz gives of Job, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-9.htm">Job 22:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{k}</span> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</span><p>(k) That is, I helped him who was in distress, and so he had cause to praise me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me</span> (comp. ver. 11). Oppression in the East sometimes drives its victims to actual starvation or to suicide. Isaiah calls the oppressors against whom he inveighs "murderers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>). These "perishing" ones Job often saved, and they "blessed" him. <span class="cmt_word">And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy</span>. How cold are the words of Ameni, "No widow have I oppressed," compared with these! Job was not content with mere abstinence from evil, mere negative virtue. He so actively and effectually relieved distress that affliction was turned into happiness, and lamentation into rejoicing. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  When I went forth to the gate of the city,<p>Prepared my seat in the market,<p>  8  Then the young men hid themselves as soon as they saw me,<p>And the aged rose up, remained standing.<p>  9  Princes refrained from speaking,<p>And laid their hand on their mouth.<p>10  The voice of the nobles was hidden,<p>And their tongue clave to their palate.<p>When he left the bounds of his domain, and came into the city, he was everywhere received with the profoundest respect. From the facts of the case, it is inadmissible to translate quum egrederer portam after <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-24.htm">Genesis 34:24</a>, comp. infra, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-34.htm">Job 31:34</a>, for the district where Job dwelt is to be thought of as being without a gate. True, he did not dwell with his family in tents, i.e., pavilions of hair, but in houses; he was not a nomad (a wandering herdsman), or what is the same thing, a Beduin, otherwise his children would not have been slain in a stone house, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>. "The daughter of the duck," says an Arabian proverb, "is a swimmer," and the son of a Beduin never dwells in a stone house. He was, however, also, not a citizen, but a hadar&#305;&#770; (&#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;), i.e., a permanent resident, a large landowner and husbandman. Thus therefore &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; (for which Ew. after the lxx reads &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;: "when I went up early in the morning to the city") is locative, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; (comp. &#1510;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, go out into the field, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-3.htm">Genesis 27:3</a>): when he went forth to the gate above the city; or even, since it is natural to imagine the city as situated on an eminence: up to the city (so that &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; includes in itself by implication the notion of &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;); not, however: to the gate near the city (Stick., Hahn), since the gate of a city is not situated near the city, but is part of the city itself. The gates of cities and large houses in Western Asia are vaulted entrances, with large recesses on either side, where people congregate for business and negotiations.<p>(Note: Vid., Layard, New Discoveries, p. 57.)<p>The open space at the gate, which here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>, is called &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1489;, i.e., the open space within the gate and by the gate, was the forum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-4.htm">Job 5:4</a>).</body></html>
