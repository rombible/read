Happy the men who are blessed with such gifts as these! They have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good, but have great need to watch against pride. Happy the people who are blessed with such men! it is a token for good to them. Here we see what Job valued himself by, in the day of his prosperity. It was by his usefulness. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence of proud and evil men. Good magistrates must thus be a restraint to evil-doers, and protect the innocent; in order to this, they should arm themselves with zeal and resolution. Such men are public blessings, and resemble Him who rescues poor sinners from Satan. How many who were ready to perish, now are blessing Him! But who can show forth His praises? May we trust in His mercy, and seek to imitate His truth, justice, and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The young men saw me, and hid themselves - That is, they retired as if awed at my presence.

"This is a most elegant description, and exhibits most correctly the great reverence and respect which was paid, even by the old and the decrepit, to the holy man, in passing along the streets, or when he sat in public. They not only rose, which in men so old was a great mark of distinction, but they stood; and they continued to do it, though the attempt was so difficult." Lowth.

And &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; (to be written thus, not &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1497; with an aspirated )&#1508; may not be translated "(in the days) of my spring," as Symm. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, Jer. diebus adolescentiae meae, and Targ. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, whether it be that &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; here signifies the point, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769; (from &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, Arab. h&#803;rf, acuere), or the early time (spring time, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, Arab. chrf, carpere). For in reference to agriculture &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; can certainly signify the early half of the year (on this, vid., Genesis, S. 270), inasmuch as sowing and ploughing time in Palestine and Syria is in November and December; wherefore Arab. chr&#305;&#770;f signifies the early rain or autumn rain; and in Talmudic, &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, premature (ripe too early), is the opposite of &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;, late, but the derivatives of &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; only obtain this signification connotative, for, according to its proper signification, &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; (Arab. chr&#305;&#770;f with other forms) is the gathering time, i.e., the time of the fruit harvest (syn. &#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;), while the Hebr. &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; (&#1488;&#1489;) corresponds to the spring in our sense. If Job meant his youth, he would have said &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, or something similar; but as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-5.htm">Job 29:5</a> shows, he meant his manhood, and this he calls his autumn as the season of maturity, or rather of the abundance of fruits (Schult.: aetatem virilem suis fructibus faetum et exuberantum),<p>(Note: The fresh vegetation, indeed, in hotter districts (e.g., in the valley of the Jordan and Euphrates) begins with the arrival of the autumnal rains, but the real spring (comp. Sol 2:11-13) only begins about the vernal equinox, and still later on the mountains. On the contrary, the late summer, &#1511;&#1497;&#1509;, which passes over into the autumn, &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, is the season for gathering the fruit. The produce of the fields, garden fruit, and grapes ripen before the commencement of the proper autumn; some (when the land can be irrigated) summer fruits, e.g., Dhura (maize) and melons, in like manner olives and dates, ripen in autumn. Therefore the translation, in the days of my autumn ("of my harvest"), is the only correct one. If &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; were intended here in a sense not used elsewhere, it might signify, according to the Arabic with h, "(in the days) of my prosperity," or "my power," or even with Arab. ch, "(in the days) of my youthful vigour;" for chara&#770;fa&#770;t are rash words and deeds, charfa&#770;n one who says or does anything rash from lightness, the feebleness of old age, etc. (according to Wetzst., very common words in Syria): &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; or &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, therefore the thoughtlessness of youth, Arab. jahl, i.e., the rash desire of doing something great, which &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; &#1492;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>).
