Though Bildad thought the application of it to Job was easy, yet it was not safe nor just. It is common for angry disputants to rank their opponents among God's enemies, and to draw wrong conclusions from important truths. The destruction of the wicked is foretold. That destruction is represented under the similitude of a beast or bird caught in a snare, or a malefactor taken into custody. Satan, as he was a murderer, so he was a robber, from the beginning. He, the tempter, lays snares for sinners wherever they go. If he makes them sinful like himself, he will make them miserable like himself. Satan hunts for the precious life. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare for himself, and God is preparing for his destruction. See here how the sinner runs himself into the snare.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And his candle - Margin, lamp. The reference is to a lamp that was suspended from the ceiling. The Arabians are fond of this image. Thus, they say, "Bad fortune has extinguished my lamp." Of a man whose hopes are remarkably blasted, they say, "He is like a lamp which is immediately extinguished if you let it sink in the oil." See Schultens. The putting out of a lamp is to the Orientals an image of utter desolation. It is the universal custom to have a light burning in their houses at night. "The houses of Egypt, in modern times, are never without lights; they burn lamps all the night long, and in every occupied apartment. So requisite to the comfort of a family is this custom reckoned, and so imperious is the power which it exercises, that the poorest people. would rather retrench part of their food than neglect it." Paxton. It is not improbable that this custom prevailed in former times in Arabia, as it does now in Egypt; and this consideration will give increased beauty and force to this passage. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. candle&#8212;the lamp which in the East is usually fastened to the ceiling. Oil abounds in those regions, and the lamp was kept burning all night, as now in Egypt, where the poorest would rather dispense with food than the night lamp (Ps 18:28).

There is no objection to this explanation so far as the syntax is concerned, but there will then be weighty thoughts which are also expressed in the form of fresh thoughts, for which independent clauses seem more appropriate, under the government of &#1488;&#1501;, as if they were presuppositions. The transition from the preceding strophe to this becomes also easier, if we take <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-13.htm">Job 17:13</a>. as independent clauses from which, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>, an inference is drawn, with Waw indicative of the train of thought (Ew. 348). Accordingly, we regard &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-13.htm">Job 17:13</a> as antecedent (denoted by Dech, i.e., Tiphcha anterius, just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>) and &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; as conclusion; the Waw apod. is wanting, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a>., and the structure of the sentence is similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>. If I hope, says Job, "Shel is my house"  equals  this is the substance of my hope, that Shel will be my house. In darkness he has (i.e., in his consciousness, which anticipates that which is before him as near and inevitable) fixed his resting-place (poet. strata, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-3.htm">Psalm 132:3</a>). To corruption and the worm he already cries, father! and, mother! sister! It is, as it seems, that bold figure which is indicated in the Job-like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-19.htm">Psalm 88:19</a> ("my acquaintances are the realms of darkness"), which is here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>) worked out; and, differently applied, perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-4.htm">Proverbs 7:4</a> echoes it. Since the fem. &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is used as the object addressed by &#1488;&#1502;&#1497; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, which is besides, on account of its always collective meaning (in distinction from &#1514;&#1497;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;), well suited for this double apostrophe, we may assume that the poet will have used a masc. object for &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;; and there is really no reason against &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; here being, with Ramban, Rosenm., Schlottm., Bttcher (de inferis, 179), derived not from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (as &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>, from &#1504;&#1493;&#1495;), but from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; (as &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>, from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;), especially since the old versions transl. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; also elsewhere &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769; (putredo), and thereby prove that both derivations accord with the structure of the language. Now already conscious of his belonging to corruption and the worm as by the closest ties of relationship, he asks: Itaque ubi tandem spes mea?<p>The accentuation connects &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; to the following word, instead of uniting it with &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a>; Luzzatto (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a>) considers this as a mistake in the Codd., and certainly the accentuation <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-38.htm">Judges 9:38</a> (&#1488;&#1497;&#1492; Kadma, &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488; Mercha) is not according to our model, and even in this passage another arrangement of the accents is found, e.g., in the edition of Brescia.<p>(Note: This accentuates &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492; with Munach, &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; with Munach, which accords with the matter, instead of which, according to Luzz., since the Athnach-word &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; consists of three syllables, it should be more correctly accentuated &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492; with Munach, &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; with Dech. Both, also Munach Munach, are admissible; vid., Br, Thorath Emeth, S. 43, 7, comp. S. 71, not.)<p>No other hope, in Job's opinion, but speedy death is before him; no human eye is capable of seeing, i.e., of discovering (so e.g., Hahn), any other hope than just this. Somewhat differently Hirz. and others: and my hope, viz., of my recovery, who will it see in process of fulfilment? Certainly &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is in both instances equivalent to a hope which he dared to harbour; and the meaning is, that beside the one hope which he has, and which is a hope only per antiphrasin, there is no room for another hope; there is none such (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>), and no one will attain a sight of such, be it visible in the distance or experienced as near at hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>). The subj. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a> is not the hope of recovery which the friends present to him (so e.g., Ew.), but his only real hope: this, avoiding human ken, descends to the lower world, for it is the hope of death, and consequently the death of hope. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; signifies bars, bolts, which Hahn denies, although he says himself that &#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; signifies beams of wood among other things; "bolts" is not here intended to imply such as are now used in locks, but the cross bars and beams of wood of any size that serve as a fastening to a door; vectis in exactly the same manner combines the meanings, a carrying-pole and a bar, in which signification &#1489;&#1468;&#1491; is the synon. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;.<p>(Note: Accordingly we also explain <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a> after <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a>, and transl.: The sword moveth round in his (Ephraim's) cities, and destroyeth his (Ephraim's) bars (i.e., the bars of his gates), and devoureth round about, because of their counsels.)<p>The meanings assigned to the word, wastes (Schnurrer and others), bounds (Hahn), clefts (Bttch.), and the like, are fanciful and superfluous. On &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492;, instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;, vid., Caspari on Obad. Oba 1:13, Ges. 47, rem. 3. It is sing., not plur. (Bttch.), for <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a> does not speak of two hopes, not even if, as it seems according to the ancient versions, another word of cognate meaning had stood in the place of the second &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; originally. His hope goes down to the regions of the dead, when altogether there is rest in the dust. This "together, &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;," Hahn explains: to me and it, to this hope; but that would be pursuing the figure to an inadmissible length, extending far beyond <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-11.htm">Job 20:11</a>, and must then be expressed &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. Others (e.g., Hirz., Ew.) explain: if at the same time, i.e., simultaneously with this descent of my hope, there is rest to me in the dust. Considering the use of &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; in itself, it might be explained: if altogether entirely there is rest in the dust; but this meaning integer, totus quantus, the word has elsewhere always in connection with a subj. or obj. to which it is referable, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-15.htm">Psalm 33:15</a>; and, moreover, it may be rendered also in the like passages by "all together," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-18.htm">Job 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-26.htm">Job 21:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-13.htm">Job 40:13</a>, instead of "altogether, entirely." Since, on the other hand, the signification "at the same time" can at least with probability be supported by <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a>, and since &#1488;&#1501;, which is certainly used temporally, brings contemporary things together, we prefer the translation: "when at the same time in the dust there is rest." The descent of his hope to the bars of Hades is at the same time his own, who hopes for nothing but this. When the death of his hope becomes a reality, then at the same time his turmoil of suffering will pass over to the rest of the grave.<p>continued...</body></html>
