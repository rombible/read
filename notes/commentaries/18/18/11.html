The way of sin is the way of fear, and leads to everlasting confusion, of which the present terrors of an impure conscience are earnests, as in Cain and Judas. Miserable indeed is a wicked man's death, how secure soever his life was. See him dying; all that he trusts to for his support shall be taken from him. How happy are the saints, and how indebted to the lord Jesus, by whom death is so far done away and changed, that this king of terrors is become a friend and a servant! See the wicked man's family sunk and cut off. His children shall perish, either with him or after him. Those who consult the true honour of their family, and its welfare, will be afraid of withering all by sin. The judgments of God follow the wicked man after death in this world, as a proof of the misery his soul is in after death, and as an earnest of that everlasting shame and contempt to which he shall rise in the great day. The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot, Pr 10:7. It would be well if this report of wicked men would cause any to flee from the wrath to come, from which their power, policy, and riches cannot deliver them. But Jesus ever liveth to deliver all who trust in him. Bear up then, suffering believers. Ye shall for a little time have sorrow, but your Beloved, your Saviour, will see you again; your hearts shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Terrors shall make him afraid - He shall be constantly subject to alarms, and shall never feel secure. "Terrors here are represented as allegorical persons, like the Furies in the Greek poets." Noyes. The idea here is substantially the same as that given by Eliphaz, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-22</a>.<p>And shall drive him to his feet - Margin, scatter. This is a literal translation of the Hebrew. The idea is, that he will be alarmed by such terrors; his self-composure will be dissipated, and he will "take to his heels." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Terrors&#8212;often mentioned in this book (Job 18:14; 24:17; &c.). The terrors excited through an evil conscience are here personified. "Magor-missabib" (Jer 20:3).<p>drive &#8230; to his feet&#8212;rather, "shall pursue" (literally, "scatter," Hab 3:14) him close "at his heels" (literally, "immediately after his feet," Hab 3:5; 1Sa 25:42; Hebrew). The image is that of a pursuing conqueror who scatters the enemy [Umbreit].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Terrors; </span> both from men, and from God, and from his own unquiet mind and guilty conscience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall drive him to his feet; </span> shall force him to flee hither and thither, and he knows not whither, being secure and safe no where, but pursued by terrors from place to place. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,.... Make him a "Magormissabib", or "terror on every side", as Pashur was a terror to himself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>, and all his friends about him; these terrors may be either the terrors of the judges of the earth upon wicked men, who are, or should be, a terror to evildoers, and of whom wicked men are afraid, lest they should be taken and punished by them; to this sense is the note of Sephorno: or else the terrors of a guilty conscience, which drive a man to his wits' end, that he knows not what to do, nor whither to go; these terrify him night and day, and make an hell upon earth unto him; or the terrors of the righteous law of God broken by him, its menaces and curses threatening him with death and everlasting damnation; or the terrors of the judgments of God on earth, which by their forerunners appear to be coming on it, by reason of which men's hearts fail for fear of them; or terrible apprehensions of the wrath of God for sin, here and hereafter, together with the terrors of death, which fall upon them, and of an awful judgment yet to come. Now Bildad had observed, that Job had said some things concerning the terrors he was sometimes possessed of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; and therefore would suggest from hence that he must be a wicked man, since this is the case of such; but it is easy to observe that good men are sometimes surrounded with terrors as well as others, so that this is no proof of a man's character and state, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-15.htm">Psalm 88:15</a>; <p>and shall drive him to his feet; to take to his feet and run, in order to get rid of his terrors if possible, but in vain; these cause him not to run to God, to his feet, to the throne and footstool of his grace, but from him, to the rocks and mountains to hide him from his wrath, though there is no going from his spirit, nor fleeing from his presence; and terrors will also have such an effect upon wielded men as to cause them to flee from men, as in Cain, who not only went, from the presence of the Lord, but from the society of men, and became a fugitive and vagabond, and afraid of everyone he met with, lest he should kill him; and sometimes wicked men flee when none pursue, and even at the sound of shaking leaf, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>; or "shall scatter him at his feet" (t), either at the feet of the robber, or cause him to fall to the ground, in the place where his feet stood. Mr. Broughton renders it, "shall press him at his feet", shall follow at his heels, and keep close to him wherever he goes, and overtake and seize him. <p>(t) "dispergent eum", Pagninus, Montanus, Beza, Mercerus, Piscator, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. This verse does not seem to give a picture of the sinner’s conscience, but rather of his consciousness at last. The preceding verses described how he walked on snares unwitting that they were there; now he awakens to the perception of his condition, he feels the complications that surround him, and would flee from the terrors that he has come to realize.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and shall drive him to his feet</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">and drive him away at his heels</span>.

Vague fears, panic terrors, no longer subjective, but to his bewildered brain objective, shall seem to menace the wicked man on every side, and shall affright him continually. There is an allusion, doubtless, to what Job has said of the  gloomy and terrifying thoughts which come over him from time to time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-25.htm">Job 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-28.htm">Job 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>) and fill him with consternation. <span class="cmt_word">And shall drive him to his feet</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall chase him at his</span> heels (see the Revised Version). Like a pack of hounds, or wolves, or jackals. Jackals are common in Palestine and the adjacent countries. They hunt in lacks, and generally run down their prey; but do not, unless hard pressed by hunger, attack men. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1490;&#1468;&#1501; is here equivalent to nevertheless, or prop. even, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-2.htm">Psalm 129:2</a> (Ew. 354, a). The light of the evil-doer goes out, and the comfortable brightness and warmth which the blaze (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, only here as a Hebr. word; according to Raschi and others, tincelle, a spark; but according to lxx, Theod., Syr., Jer., a flame; Targ. the brightness of light) of his fire in his dwelling throws out, comes to an end. In one word, as the praet. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; implies, the light in his tent is changed into darkness; and his lamp above him, i.e., the lamp hanging from the covering of his tent (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a>), goes out. When misfortune breaks in upon him, the Arab says: ed-dahru attfaa es-sira&#770;gi, fate has put out my lamp; this figure of the decline of prosperity receives here a fourfold application. The figure of straitening one's steps is just as Arabic as it is biblical; &#1510;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, the steps of his strength (&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; synon. of &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a>) become narrow (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-12.htm">Proverbs 4:12</a>, Arab. taka&#770;ssarat), by the wide space which he could pass over with a self-confident feeling of power becoming more and more contracted; and the purpose formed selfishly and without any recognition of God, the success of which he considered infallible, becomes his overthrow. </body></html>
