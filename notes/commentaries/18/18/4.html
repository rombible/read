The last clause is a direct quotation from Job in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-18.htm" title="And surely the mountains falling comes to nothing, and the rock is removed out of his place.">Job 14:18</a>; it looks, therefore, very much like a wilful perversion of Job’s words, for it is clear that he used them very differently. Even if there were no intentional misrepresentation Bildad applies Job’s words to his own purposes. The drift of his question is, “Can you expect the course of God’s providence to be altered for you? On the contrary, the retribution that awaits the wicked is sure and swift; for verily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-5.htm" title="Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.">Job 18:5</a>) the light of the wicked shall be put out.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-4 Bildad had before given Job good advice and encouragement; here he used nothing but rebukes, and declared his ruin.

It is not an affirmation about Job, but it is a direct address to him. The meaning is, that he was in the paryoxysms of a violent rage; he acted like a madman.<p>Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? - A reproof of his pride and arrogance. "Shall everything be made to give way for you? Are you the only man in the world and of so much importance, that the earth is to be made vacant for you to dwell in? Are the interests of all others to be sacrificed for you, and is everything else to give place for you? Are all the laws of God's government to be made to yield rather than that you should be punished?" Similar modes of expression to denote the insignificance of anyone who is proud and arrogant, are still used among the Arabs. "Since Muhammed died, the Imams govern." "The world will not suffer loss on your account." "The world is not dependent on anyone man." T. Hunt, in Lowth's Lectures on Hebrew Poetry. Rosenmuller's Morgenland, in lec.<p>And shall the rock be removed out of his place? - "Shall the most firm and immutable things give way for your special accommodation? Shall the most important and settled principles of the divine administration be made to bend on your account?" These were not the principles and feelings of Job; and great injustice was done to him by this supposition. He was disposed to be submissive in the main to the divine arrangement. But this will describe the feelings of many a man of pride, who supposes that the divine arrangements should be made to bend for his special accommodation, and that the great, eternal principles of justice and right should give way rather than that he should be dealt with as common sinners are, and rather than that he should be cast into hell. Such people wish a special place of salvation for themselves. They are too proud to be saved as others are. They complain in their hearts that they are made to suffer, to lose their property, to be sick, to die - as others do. They would wish to be treated with special mercy, and to have special enactments in their favor, and would have the eternal laws of right made to bend for their special accommodation Such is the pride of the human heart! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

He alludes here to Job's words as to the "rock," crumbling away (Job 14:18, 19); but in a different application. He says bitterly "for thee." Wert thou not punished as thou art, and as thou art unwilling to bear, the eternal order of the universe would be disturbed and the earth become desolate through unavenged wickedness [Umbreit]. Bildad takes it for granted Job is a great sinner (Job 8:3-6; Isa 24:5, 6).

Or "his soul" (l), meaning Job, and referring to what he had said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>; Now, says Bildad, it is neither God nor man that tears you, it is you yourself; representing Job as a madman, rending his clothes, tearing his flesh, and even his very soul; for by his passion which he expressed, whether to God or his friends, it did himself the most hurt, he broke his peace, and spoiled his comfort, and ruined his health, and made himself the most unhappy of mankind, by giving vent to his passion, to his wrath and anger, which slays and a man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>; here a charge of impatience is suggested, contrary to the character even of Job, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>; <p>shall the earth be forsaken for thee? through fear of thee, because of thy rage and fury; dost thou think that the inhabitants of the earth will flee before thee, at thy storming, rage, and wrath? before God none can stand when he is angry: there is no abiding his indignation when his fury is poured out like fire, and persons of the greatest rank will flee to the rocks and mountains to hide them from his face and fury; but what dost thou think, or make thyself to be, to be as Deity, that the inhabitants of the earth should flee fore thee, and forsake it? or when thou diest, dost thou think that all the inhabitants of the earth will die with thee, and so it will be forsaken for thy sake? taking the hint from what Job had said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>; or dost thou think thyself a man of so much importance and consequence in the earth that when thou diest there will not be a man left of any worth and notice, that all might as well die with thee? or will God drop the government of the world on thy account? will he no more employ his care and providence in concerning himself in the affairs of the world, but let all things go as they will, and so the earth, as to his providential regards to it, be forsaken for thy sake? will God neither do good to good men, nor punish bad men? which must be the case according to thy doctrine; but will God counteract this method of his providence, he has always taken in the earth, that thou mayest appear not to be an evil man, as might be concluded from thine afflictions, but a good man notwithstanding them? <p>and shall the rock be removed out of his place? which is not usual, nor can it be done by man; it may be done by God, who touches the mountains, and they smoke, and at whose presence they drop and move, as Sinai did, and as the mountains and hills will flee away at the presence of the Judge of all the earth, when he appears; but no such phenomenon can be expected upon the presence and sight of a man; much less can God himself, who is often called a Rock, and is immovable, unalterable, and unchangeable in his nature, perfections, purposes, and the counsels of his will, be made to act contrary to either of them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; nor will he do it for the sake of any man; he does all things after the counsel of his own will; he takes a constant course in Providence, in the government of the world, canst thou think that he will go out of his usual way for thy sake, in punishing wicked men, and rewarding good men? you may as soon imagine that a rock will be removed out of its place as the ordinary course of Providence will be altered on thy account; to suppose this is presumption, pride, and arrogance, which is what Bildad means to fasten upon Job. <p>(l) "animam suam", Pagninus, Montanus, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{c}</span> He teareth himself in his anger: shall the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</span><p>(c) That is, like a madman.<p>(d) Shall God change the order of nature for your sake, by dealing with you otherwise than he does with all man?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

Bildad asks if the current of the moral order of the world is to be interrupted or turned back for Job’s sake, that he may escape the imputation of wickedness, or the penalty of it, and that his principles may be accepted? cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm" title="O earth, cover not you my blood, and let my cry have no place.">Job 16:18</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He teareth himself in his anger</span>. The Hebrew idiom, which allows of rapid transitions from the second to the third person, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, cannot be transferred without harshness to our modern speech. Our Revisers have given the true force of the original by discarding the third person, and translating, "Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger." There is probably an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>, where Job had represented God as "tearing him in his wrath." Bildad says it is not God who tests him - he tears himself. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Shall the course of the world be altered to meet thy wishes, to suit thy case?"

There is no objection to this explanation so far as the syntax is concerned, but there will then be weighty thoughts which are also expressed in the form of fresh thoughts, for which independent clauses seem more appropriate, under the government of &#1488;&#1501;, as if they were presuppositions. The transition from the preceding strophe to this becomes also easier, if we take <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-13.htm">Job 17:13</a>. as independent clauses from which, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>, an inference is drawn, with Waw indicative of the train of thought (Ew. 348). Accordingly, we regard &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-13.htm">Job 17:13</a> as antecedent (denoted by Dech, i.e., Tiphcha anterius, just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>) and &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; as conclusion; the Waw apod. is wanting, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a>., and the structure of the sentence is similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>. If I hope, says Job, "Shel is my house"  equals  this is the substance of my hope, that Shel will be my house. In darkness he has (i.e., in his consciousness, which anticipates that which is before him as near and inevitable) fixed his resting-place (poet. strata, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-3.htm">Psalm 132:3</a>). To corruption and the worm he already cries, father! and, mother! sister! It is, as it seems, that bold figure which is indicated in the Job-like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-19.htm">Psalm 88:19</a> ("my acquaintances are the realms of darkness"), which is here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>) worked out; and, differently applied, perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-4.htm">Proverbs 7:4</a> echoes it. Since the fem. &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is used as the object addressed by &#1488;&#1502;&#1497; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, which is besides, on account of its always collective meaning (in distinction from &#1514;&#1497;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;), well suited for this double apostrophe, we may assume that the poet will have used a masc. object for &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;; and there is really no reason against &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; here being, with Ramban, Rosenm., Schlottm., Bttcher (de inferis, 179), derived not from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (as &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>, from &#1504;&#1493;&#1495;), but from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; (as &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>, from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;), especially since the old versions transl. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; also elsewhere &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769; (putredo), and thereby prove that both derivations accord with the structure of the language. Now already conscious of his belonging to corruption and the worm as by the closest ties of relationship, he asks: Itaque ubi tandem spes mea?<p>The accentuation connects &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; to the following word, instead of uniting it with &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a>; Luzzatto (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a>) considers this as a mistake in the Codd., and certainly the accentuation <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-38.htm">Judges 9:38</a> (&#1488;&#1497;&#1492; Kadma, &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488; Mercha) is not according to our model, and even in this passage another arrangement of the accents is found, e.g., in the edition of Brescia.<p>(Note: This accentuates &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492; with Munach, &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; with Munach, which accords with the matter, instead of which, according to Luzz., since the Athnach-word &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; consists of three syllables, it should be more correctly accentuated &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492; with Munach, &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; with Dech. Both, also Munach Munach, are admissible; vid., Br, Thorath Emeth, S. 43, 7, comp. S. 71, not.)<p>No other hope, in Job's opinion, but speedy death is before him; no human eye is capable of seeing, i.e., of discovering (so e.g., Hahn), any other hope than just this. Somewhat differently Hirz. and others: and my hope, viz., of my recovery, who will it see in process of fulfilment? Certainly &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is in both instances equivalent to a hope which he dared to harbour; and the meaning is, that beside the one hope which he has, and which is a hope only per antiphrasin, there is no room for another hope; there is none such (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>), and no one will attain a sight of such, be it visible in the distance or experienced as near at hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>). The subj. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a> is not the hope of recovery which the friends present to him (so e.g., Ew.), but his only real hope: this, avoiding human ken, descends to the lower world, for it is the hope of death, and consequently the death of hope. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; signifies bars, bolts, which Hahn denies, although he says himself that &#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; signifies beams of wood among other things; "bolts" is not here intended to imply such as are now used in locks, but the cross bars and beams of wood of any size that serve as a fastening to a door; vectis in exactly the same manner combines the meanings, a carrying-pole and a bar, in which signification &#1489;&#1468;&#1491; is the synon. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;.<p>(Note: Accordingly we also explain <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a> after <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a>, and transl.: The sword moveth round in his (Ephraim's) cities, and destroyeth his (Ephraim's) bars (i.e., the bars of his gates), and devoureth round about, because of their counsels.)<p>The meanings assigned to the word, wastes (Schnurrer and others), bounds (Hahn), clefts (Bttch.), and the like, are fanciful and superfluous. On &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492;, instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;, vid., Caspari on Obad. Oba 1:13, Ges. 47, rem. 3. It is sing., not plur. (Bttch.), for <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a> does not speak of two hopes, not even if, as it seems according to the ancient versions, another word of cognate meaning had stood in the place of the second &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; originally. His hope goes down to the regions of the dead, when altogether there is rest in the dust. This "together, &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;," Hahn explains: to me and it, to this hope; but that would be pursuing the figure to an inadmissible length, extending far beyond <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-11.htm">Job 20:11</a>, and must then be expressed &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. Others (e.g., Hirz., Ew.) explain: if at the same time, i.e., simultaneously with this descent of my hope, there is rest to me in the dust. Considering the use of &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; in itself, it might be explained: if altogether entirely there is rest in the dust; but this meaning integer, totus quantus, the word has elsewhere always in connection with a subj. or obj. to which it is referable, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-15.htm">Psalm 33:15</a>; and, moreover, it may be rendered also in the like passages by "all together," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-18.htm">Job 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-26.htm">Job 21:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-13.htm">Job 40:13</a>, instead of "altogether, entirely." Since, on the other hand, the signification "at the same time" can at least with probability be supported by <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a>, and since &#1488;&#1501;, which is certainly used temporally, brings contemporary things together, we prefer the translation: "when at the same time in the dust there is rest." The descent of his hope to the bars of Hades is at the same time his own, who hopes for nothing but this. When the death of his hope becomes a reality, then at the same time his turmoil of suffering will pass over to the rest of the grave.<p>continued...</body></html>
