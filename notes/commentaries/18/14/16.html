He represents God as carrying matters to extremity against him. The Lord must prevail against all who contend with him. God may send disease and pain, we may lose all comfort in those near and dear to us, every hope of earthly happiness may be destroyed, but God will receive the believer into realms of eternal happiness. But what a change awaits the prosperous unbeliever! How will he answer when God shall call him to his tribunal? The Lord is yet upon a mercy-seat, ready to be gracious. Oh that sinners would be wise, that they would consider their latter end! While man's flesh is upon him, that is, the body he is so loth to lay down, it shall have pain; and while his soul is within him, that is, the spirit he is so loth to resign, it shall mourn. Dying work is hard work; dying pangs often are sore pangs. It is folly for men to defer repentance to a death-bed, and to have that to do which is the one thing needful, when unfit to do anything.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For now thou numberest my steps - Thou dost make strict inquiry into all my conduct, that thou mayest mark my errors, and hold me bound to punishment.

Or "but now" (g), at this present time thou seemest to have no desire to me, or affection for me, but the reverse. Job was in a pretty good frame of mind a little before, having in view his last change, and the glorious resurrection; but on a sudden he returns to his former complaints of God, and here of the rigour and strictness of his justice in marking his steps, and correcting him for his sin; so very uncertain are the best of frames: the outward conversation of men, whether good or bad, is often in Scripture expressed by walking, and the actions of men, good or evil, are the steps taken therein; here they signify evil ones, irregular steps, steps out of the way of God's commandments, aberrations, strayings from thence, false steps; these Job supposed God not only had knowledge of, as he has of all the ways, paths, and goings of men, but took very exact notice of his wrong steps; looked very narrowly to his paths, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>; and strictly marked them; yea, told them one by one, that he might miss none, and make up a large account, which he put down in his book, in order to produce against him; in which Job was mistaken: he thought God dealt with him as he does with wicked men, whose evil actions are not only known and observed, but are counted and put down in the book of his remembrance, which will be opened at the last day, and produced against them; but God has blotted out of his book the sins of his people, and will remember them no more; he has a book of remembrance for their good works, words, and thoughts, but none for their evil ones: <p>dost thou not watch over my sin? of error, infirmity, and weakness; observe it, mark it in a strict and rigorous way, which, when God does, who can stand before him? or "watch for my sin?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-14.htm">Daniel 9:14</a> as Jeremiah's enemies watched for his halting; so Job here represents God very wrongly, as if he watched for an opportunity against him, to take the advantage of it, and severely chastise him: or "thou dost not wait for my sin" (h); that is, the punishment of it as many of the Jewish writers (i) carry the sense; which is, that God did not defer the punishment of sin, or give him any respite or breathing time, but as soon as ever he committed any offence, immediately, at once, he was rough with him, and used him with great severity. Aben Ezra inserts the word "only", as explanative of the meaning of the words, thus, "thou watchest only over my sin", or dost not mark and observe anything but my sins; not my good deeds, only my evil ones; which is a wrong charge, for God takes notice of the good works of his people, and rewards them in a way of grace, though not of debt, as well as of their evil works, and chastises for them in a fatherly way: others render the words to this sense, what is not, or of no moment or consequence, thou keepest for me in mind and memory, as sin (k); that which is not sin, or at least not known to me to be sin, or however something very trifling, scarce to be called a sin, yet I am dealt with for it as if a very heinous one; or I am afflicted for I know not what, or, which is all one, for what is not known to me. Some take the words to be a petition, "do not observe my sin" (l); or mark it strictly, or keep it in mind, or reserve it against another time, but hide thy face from it, and remember it no more, nor never against me. <p>(g)  "at nunc", Piscator.

Job, at this point, proceeds to contrast his actual condition with the ideal one which (in vers. 13-15) his imagination has conjured up. God's actual attitude towards him he regards as one, not of protecting love, but of jealous hostility. His "steps" are observed, counted - every divergence from the right path is noted - a false step, if he makes one, is at once punished. <span class="cmt_word">Dost thou not watch over my sin?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-14.htm">Job 10:14</a>). Job's sins, he thinks, are watched for, spied out, taken note of, and remembered against him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10  But man dieth, he lieth there stretched out,<p>Man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?<p>11  The waters flow away from the sea,<p>And a stream decayeth and dryeth up:<p>12  So man lieth down and riseth not again;<p>Till the heavens pass away they wake not,<p>And are not aroused from their sleep.<p>How much less favoured is the final lot of man! He dies, and then lies there completely broken down and melted away (&#1495;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;( yaw, in the neuter signification, confectum esse, rendered in the Targum by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; and &#1488;&#1514;&#1502;&#1511;&#1502;&#1511;). The fut. consec. continues the description of the cheerless results of death: He who has thus once fallen together is gone without leaving a trace of life. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-11.htm">Job 14:11</a>. this vanishing away without hope and beyond recovery is contemplated under the figure of running water, or of water that is dried up and never returns again to its channel. Instead of &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; Isaiah uses &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-5.htm">Job 19:5</a>) in the oracle on Egypt, a prophecy in which many passages borrowed from the book of Job are interwoven. The former means to flow away (related radically with &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;), the latter to dry up (transposed &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-14.htm">Jeremiah 18:14</a>). But he also uses &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, which signifies the drying in, and then &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, which is the complete drying up which follows upon the drying in (vid., Genesis, S. 264). What is thus figuratively expressed is introduced by waw (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>), similar to the waw adaequationis of the emblematic proverbs mentioned at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> : so there is for man no rising (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), no waking up (&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1509;), no &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;), and indeed not for ever; for what does not happen until the heavens are no more (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>, till the moon is no more), never happens; because God has called the heavens and the stars with their laws into existence, &#1500;&#1506;&#1491; &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-6.htm">Psalm 148:6</a>), they never cease (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>.), the days of heaven are eternal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a>). This is not opposed to declarations like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>, for the world's history, according to the teaching of Scripture, closes with a change in all these, but not their annihilation. What is affirmed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-10.htm">Job 14:10-12</a> of mankind in general, is, by the change to the plural in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>, affirmed of each individual of the race. Their sleep of death is &#1506;&#1494;&#1500;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-39.htm">Jeremiah 51:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-57.htm">Jeremiah 51:57</a>). What Sheo&#770;l summons away from the world, the world never sees again. Oh that it were otherwise! How would the brighter future have comforted him with respect to the sorrowful present and the dark night of the grave! </body></html>
