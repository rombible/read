But when man is cut off by death, he is for ever removed from his place in this world. The life of man may fitly be compared to the waters of a land flood, which spread far, but soon dry up. All Job's expressions here show his belief in the great doctrine of the resurrection. Job's friends proving miserable comforters, he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. If our sins are forgiven, and our hearts renewed to holiness, heaven will be the rest of our souls, while our bodies are hidden in the grave from the malice of our enemies, feeling no more pain from our corruptions, or our corrections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though the root thereof wax old - Though life becomes almost extinct. The idea is, though the root of the tree be very old, yet it does not become wholly lifeless. It is not like an old man, when life goes out altogether. In the very aged root there will be vitality still; but not so in man.<p>Though the stock thereof - The stump - literally that which is cut off - &#1490;&#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;  geza&#8219;o&#770;. The meaning is, that when the trunk of the tree is cut down and dies altogether, life remains in the root; but when man fails, life is wholly extinct. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Man may the more claim a peaceful life, since, when separated from it by death, he never returns to it. This does not deny a future life, but a return to the present condition of life. Job plainly hopes for a future state (Job 14:13; Job 7:2). Still, it is but vague and trembling hope, not assurance; excepting the one bright glimpse in Job 19:25. The Gospel revelation was needed to change fears, hopes, and glimpses into clear and definite certainties.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wax old; </span> begin to wither and decay. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And the stock die, </span> to wit, in outward appearance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,....

How can God pass so strict a judgment on man, whose life is so short and full of sorrow, and which cannot possibly be pure from sin? - <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1</a>. &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is followed by three clauses in apposition, or rather two, for &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; (lxx &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-11.htm">Matthew 11:11</a>; comp. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;. Sir. 10:18) belongs to the subject as an adjectival clause: woman-born man, short-lived, and full of unrest, opens out as a flower. Woman is weak, with pain she brings forth children; she is impure during her lying-in, therefore weakness, suffering, and impurity is the portion of man even from the birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-4.htm">Job 25:4</a>). As &#1511;&#1510;&#1512; is the constr. of &#1511;&#1510;&#1512;, so (&#1512;&#1490;&#1494;) &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; is from &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;, which here, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>, has the strong signification: endowed (with adversity). It is questionable whether &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>, signifies et marcescit or et succiditur. We have decided here as elsewhere (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>, Genesis, S. 383) in favour of the latter meaning, and as the Targ. (&#1488;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;), translated "he is mown down." For this meaning (prop. to cut off from above or before, to lop off), - in which the verb &#1502;&#1500;&#1500; (&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;) is become technical for the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;, - is most probably favoured by its application in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a>; where Jerome however translates, sicut summitates spicarum conterentur, since he derives &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493; from &#1502;&#1500;&#1500; in the signification not found in the Bible (unless perhaps retained in &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; ni , <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-25.htm">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>), fricare (Arab. mll, frigere, to parch). At the same time, the signification marcescere, which certainly cannot be combined with praecidere, but may be with fricare (conterere), is not unnatural; it is more appropriate to a flower (comp. &#1504;&#1489;&#1500; &#1510;&#1497;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>); it accords with the parallelism <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>, and must be considered etymologically possible in comparison with &#1511;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500; &#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;. But it is not supported by any dialect, and none of the old translations furnish any certain evidence in its favour; &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>, which is to be understood impersonally rather than intransitively, does not favour it; and none of the passages in which &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500; occurs demand it: least of all <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a>, where praeciduntur is more suitable than, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>, praeciditur, quite as suitable as, marcescit. For these reasons we also take &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500; here, not as fut. Kal from &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, or, as Hahn, from &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;  equals  &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;, to wither, but as fut. Niph. from &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, to cut down. At the same time, we do not deny the possibility of the notion of withering having been connected with &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;, whether it be that it belonged originally and independently to the root &#1502;&#1500;, or has branched off from some other radical notion, as "to fall in pieces" (lxx here &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, and similarly also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a>; comp. &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, rags, &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1495;, to come to pieces, to be dissolved) or "to become soft" (with which the significations in the dialects, to grind and to parch, may be connected). As a flower, which having opened out is soon cut or withered, is man: &#1488;&#1507;, accedit quod, insuper. This particle, related to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768;, adds an enhancing cumulat. More than this, God keeps His eye open (not: His eyes, for the correct reading, expressly noted by the Masora, is &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; without Jod plur.), &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492;, super hoc s. tali, over this poor child of man, who is a perishable flower, and not a "walking light, but a fleeting shadow" (Gregory the Great), to watch for and punish his sins, and brings Job to judgment before himself, His tribunal which puts down every justification. Elsewhere the word is pointed &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-4.htm">Job 22:4</a>; here it is &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;, because the idea is rendered determinate by the addition of &#1506;&#1502;&#1498;. </body></html>
