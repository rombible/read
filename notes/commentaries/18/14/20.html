Nay, the approach of death will frequently, through discomposing the mind, make the strongest and stoutest to change countenance: it will make the most cheerful and smiling countenance to look grave and serious, and the most bold and daring to look pale and timorous.

He represents God as carrying matters to extremity against him. The Lord must prevail against all who contend with him. God may send disease and pain, we may lose all comfort in those near and dear to us, every hope of earthly happiness may be destroyed, but God will receive the believer into realms of eternal happiness. But what a change awaits the prosperous unbeliever! How will he answer when God shall call him to his tribunal? The Lord is yet upon a mercy-seat, ready to be gracious. Oh that sinners would be wise, that they would consider their latter end! While man's flesh is upon him, that is, the body he is so loth to lay down, it shall have pain; and while his soul is within him, that is, the spirit he is so loth to resign, it shall mourn. Dying work is hard work; dying pangs often are sore pangs. It is folly for men to defer repentance to a death-bed, and to have that to do which is the one thing needful, when unfit to do anything.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou prevailest forever against him - Thou dost always show that thou art stronger than he is.

God is a more than a match for man, in anything, in everything; there is no contending with him, or standing against him, he is stronger than he, and always prevails; there is no withstanding any disease, and the force of it, when he sends it; it is a messenger and servant of his, it goes at his command, and does what he bids it do; and all the art and power of man cannot resist it, or hinder what God would have done by it; and so death itself is irresistible; what is stronger than death? it is a king that reigns with a despotic power; it reigns irresistibly, victoriously, and triumphantly; it prevails over all men, in all ages, and will do to the end of the world; no man has power over his spirit to retain it one moment, when death comes to separate it from the body: and this prevalence of God by death over men will be for ever; the grave is man's long home, to which he is brought by death, and he will never return from it more, to come again into this world, and be about the business of it as now; <p>and he passeth; out of the world, and is seen no more in it; death is a going the way of all flesh, a departure out of this life, and to it man never usually returns more; he goes to Hades, to the invisible place, and makes his appearance no more here; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35</a>; <p>thou changest his countenance; at death; the forerunners of death will change a man's countenance, pains, and diseases of body; by these God makes man's beauty to consume like the moth; the fear of death will change a man's countenance, as the handwriting on the wall did Belshazzar's, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-9.htm">Daniel 5:9</a>; even such who have out-braved death, and pretended to have made a covenant and agreement with it, yet when the king of terrors is presented to them, they are seized with a panic, their hearts ache, and their countenances turn pale; but oh! what a change is made by death itself, which for this reason is represented as riding on a pale horse; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>; when the rosy florid looks of man are gone, his comeliness turned into corruption, his countenance pale and meagre, his eyes hollow and sunk, his nose sharp pointed, his ears contracted, and jaws fallen, and his complexion altered, and still more when laid in the grave, and he is turned to rottenness, dust, and worms: <p>and sendeth him away; giveth him a dismission from this world; sendeth him out of it, from his house, his family, friends, and acquaintance: his birth is expressed often by his coming into the world, and his death by going out of it; for here he has no continuance, no abiding, no rest; and yet there is no departure till God gives him dismission by death, then he sends him away from hence; some in wrath, whom he sends to take up their abode with devils and damned spirits; others in love, to prevent their being involved in evils coming upon the earth, and to be in better company, with God and Christ, with angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect: Maimonides interprets this of Adam (r), who, when he changed the object of his countenance, and looked on the forbidden fruit, was sent out of paradise. <p>(r) Moreh Nevochim, par. 1. c. 2. p. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">thou changest his countenance</span>] A graphic and pathetic description of death.

The language of the wish reminds one of such passages in the Psalms as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-21.htm">Psalm 31:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>): "In the day of trouble He hideth me in His pavilion, and in the secret of His tabernacle doth He conceal me." So Job wishes that Hades, into which the wrath of God now precipitates him for ever, may only be a temporary place of safety for him, until the wrath of God turn away (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, comp. the causative, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-13.htm">Job 9:13</a>); that God would appoint to him, when there, a &#1495;&#1511;, i.e., a terminus ad quem (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>), and when this limit should be reached, again remember him in mercy. This is a wish that Job marks out for himself. The reality is indeed different: "if (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd;) a man dies, will he live again?" The answer which Job's consciousness, ignorant of anything better, alone can give, is: No, there is no life after death. It is, however, none the less a craving of his heart that gives rise to the wish; it is the most favourable thought, - a desirable possibility, - which, if it were but a reality, would comfort him under all present suffering: "all the days of my warfare would I wait until my change came." &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; is the name he gives to the whole of this toilsome and sorrowful interval between the present and the wished-for goal, - the life on earth, which he likens to the service of the soldier or of the hireling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1</a>), and which is subject to an inevitable destiny (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>) of manifold suffering, together with the night of Hades, where this life is continued in its most shadowy and dismal phase. And &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492; does not here signify destruction in the sense of death, as the Jewish expositors, by comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-18.htm">Isaiah 2:18</a> and Sol 2:11, explain it; but (with reference to &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-17.htm">Job 10:17</a>) the following after (Arab. chl&#305;&#770;ft, succession, successor, i.e., of Mohammed), relief, change (syn. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, exchange, barter), here of change of condition, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>, of change of mind; Aquila, Theod., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;. Oh that such a change awaited him! What a blessed future would it be if it should come to pass! Then would God call to him in the depth of Shel, and he, imprisoned until the appointed time of release, would answer Him from the deep. After His anger was spent, God would again yearn after the work of His hands (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>), the natural loving relation between the Creator and His creature would again prevail, and it would become manifest that wrath is only a waning power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>), and love His true and essential attribute. Schlottman well observes: "Job must have had a keen perception of the profound relation between the creature and his Maker in the past, to be able to give utterance to such an imaginative expectation respecting the future."<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-16.htm">Job 14:16</a>, Job supports what is cheering in this prospect, with which he wishes he might be allowed to console himself, by the contrast of the present. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is used here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a>; &#1499;&#1497; is not, as elsewhere, where &#1506;&#1514;&#1492; &#1499;&#1497; introduces the conclusion, confirmatory (indeed now  equals  then indeed), but assigns a reason (for now). Now God numbers his steps (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>), watching him as a criminal, and does not restrain himself over his sin. Most modern expositors (Ew., Hlgst, Hahn, Schlottm.) translate: Thou observest not my sins, i.e., whether they are to be so severely punished or not; but this is poor. Raschi: Thou waitest not over my sins, i.e., to punish them; instead of which Ralbag directly: Thou waitest not for my sins  equals  repentance or punishment; but &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; is not supported in the meaning: to wait, by <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11</a>. Aben-Ezra: Thou lookest not except on my sins, by supplying &#1512;&#1511;, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a> (where, however, probably &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; should be read, and &#1502; after &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-17.htm">Job 33:17</a>, has fallen away). The most doubtful is, with Hirzel, to take the sentence as interrogative, in opposition to the parallelism: and dost Thou not keep watch over my sins? It seems to me that the sense intended must be derived from the phrase &#1488;&#1507; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, which means to keep anger, and consequently to delay the manifestation of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>). This phrase is here so applied, that we obtain the sense: Thou keepest not Thy wrath to thyself, but pourest it out entirely. Mercerus is substantially correct: non reservas nec differs peccati mei punitionem. </body></html>
