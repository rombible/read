He represents God as carrying matters to extremity against him. The Lord must prevail against all who contend with him. God may send disease and pain, we may lose all comfort in those near and dear to us, every hope of earthly happiness may be destroyed, but God will receive the believer into realms of eternal happiness. But what a change awaits the prosperous unbeliever! How will he answer when God shall call him to his tribunal? The Lord is yet upon a mercy-seat, ready to be gracious. Oh that sinners would be wise, that they would consider their latter end! While man's flesh is upon him, that is, the body he is so loth to lay down, it shall have pain; and while his soul is within him, that is, the spirit he is so loth to resign, it shall mourn. Dying work is hard work; dying pangs often are sore pangs. It is folly for men to defer repentance to a death-bed, and to have that to do which is the one thing needful, when unfit to do anything.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And surely the mountain falling - Margin, "Fadeth." The sense of this is, that the hope of man in regard to living again, must certainly fail - as a mountain falls and does not rise again; as the rock is removed, and is not replaced; or as the waters wear away the stones, and they disappear. The hope of dying man was not like the tree that would spring up again <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7-9</a>; it was like the falling mountain, the wasting waters <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-11.htm">Job 14:11</a>, the rock that was removed. The reference in the phrase before us is, probably, to a mountain that settles down and disappears - as is sometimes the case in violent convulsions of nature. It does not rise again, but is gone to reappear no more. So Job says it was of man.<p>And the rock is removed - An earthquake shakes it, and removes it from its foundation, and it is not replaced. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. cometh to naught&#8212;literally, "fadeth"; a poetical image from a leaf (Isa 34:4). Here Job falls back into his gloomy bodings as to the grave. Instead of "and surely," translate "yet"; marking the transition from his brighter hopes. Even the solid mountain falls and crumbles away; man therefore cannot "hope" to escape decay or to live again in the present world (Job 14:19).<p>out of his place&#8212;so man (Ps 103:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As when a great <span class="ital">mountain falls</span>, either by an earthquake or inundation of waters, or from any other cause, it <span class="ital">moulders away like a fading leaf</span>, (as the Hebrew word signifies,) and never recovers its former height and stability; and as the rock, when by the violence of winds or earthquake, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">it is removed out of its place, </span> and thrown down, is never readvanced; and as the waters by continual droppings, or violent and frequent assaults, <span class="ital">wear away</span>, or <span class="ital">break the stones to pieces</span>, so as they can never be made whole again; and <span class="ital">as thou washest away</span>, to wit, by a great and violent inundation which thou sendest, <span class="ital">the things which grow out of the dust of the earth</span>, to wit, herbs, and fruits, and plants, which once washed away are irrecoverably lost, <span class="ital">and</span>, or <span class="ital">so</span>, (as this particle is oft used, i.e. in like manner, to wit, irrecoverably,)<span class="ital"> thou destroyest the hope of man</span>; i.e. so when man dies, all hope of living again in this world is utterly lost: and this seems to be the plain meaning of these two verses.

Job here returns to his former subject of the irreparable state of man at death, which he illustrates by various other similes, as before; and first by a "mountain falling", which may be supposed, and has been fact, and when it does, it "comes to nought"; it crumbles into dust, and where it falls there it lies, and never rises up to a mountain, or to the height it had, any more; or it "withers" (n), as some render it, the plants, herbs, and trees that grow upon it, wither away, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>; or "it is dissolved", or "flows" (o), and spreads itself over the face of the green earth it covers, and destroys with its dust and sand, which is never more gathered up to form a mountain again; so man, like unto a mountain, as kingdoms and states, and kings and princes, and great men are; the Targum instances in Lot; as a man may be said to be, that is in good health of body, and in prosperous circumstances in his family; when he falls, as he does by death, which is expressed by falling, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-38.htm">2 Samuel 3:38</a>; he comes to nought, he is not any more in the land of the living, nor in the place and circumstances in which he was before: <p>and the rock is removed out of his place; from the mountain, of which it was a part; or elsewhere, by earthquakes, by force of winds, or strength of waters; and which, when once removed, is never returned to its place any more; so man, who in his full strength seems like a rock immovable, when death comes, it shakes and moves him out of his place, and that never knows him any more. <p>(n) "marceseit", Tigurine version, Mercerus; "emarcescit", Schultens.

Job here resumes the lament 'over human infirmity, with which the chapter opens (vers. 1-12); but he has, perhaps, in this passage, his own case mote distinctly presented to his consciousness. With the wealth of metaphor which characterizes his utterances, he compares the ruin of a prosperous man <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the sudden collapse of a mountain; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the removal of a rock out of its place; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to the wearing away of stones by the constant flow of streams; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> to the destruction of alluvial tracts by floods. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mountains collapse, either by volcanic agency, which is quite as much shown in the subsidence as in the elevation of the soil, or by landslips, which are most usually the results of heavy rains. <span class="cmt_word">And the rock is removed out of his place</span>. Rocks are sometimes split by frost, and topple over when a thaw comes; at other times, heavy floods remove them from their accustomed place; occasionally earthquakes overturn them, and cause them to fall with a crash. There is also a removal of rocks to much greeter distances, by means of glaciers and icebergs; but of these Job is not likely to have known. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10  But man dieth, he lieth there stretched out,<p>Man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?<p>11  The waters flow away from the sea,<p>And a stream decayeth and dryeth up:<p>12  So man lieth down and riseth not again;<p>Till the heavens pass away they wake not,<p>And are not aroused from their sleep.<p>How much less favoured is the final lot of man! He dies, and then lies there completely broken down and melted away (&#1495;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;( yaw, in the neuter signification, confectum esse, rendered in the Targum by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; and &#1488;&#1514;&#1502;&#1511;&#1502;&#1511;). The fut. consec. continues the description of the cheerless results of death: He who has thus once fallen together is gone without leaving a trace of life. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-11.htm">Job 14:11</a>. this vanishing away without hope and beyond recovery is contemplated under the figure of running water, or of water that is dried up and never returns again to its channel. Instead of &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; Isaiah uses &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-5.htm">Job 19:5</a>) in the oracle on Egypt, a prophecy in which many passages borrowed from the book of Job are interwoven. The former means to flow away (related radically with &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;), the latter to dry up (transposed &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-14.htm">Jeremiah 18:14</a>). But he also uses &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, which signifies the drying in, and then &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, which is the complete drying up which follows upon the drying in (vid., Genesis, S. 264). What is thus figuratively expressed is introduced by waw (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>), similar to the waw adaequationis of the emblematic proverbs mentioned at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> : so there is for man no rising (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), no waking up (&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1509;), no &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;), and indeed not for ever; for what does not happen until the heavens are no more (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>, till the moon is no more), never happens; because God has called the heavens and the stars with their laws into existence, &#1500;&#1506;&#1491; &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-6.htm">Psalm 148:6</a>), they never cease (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>.), the days of heaven are eternal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a>). This is not opposed to declarations like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>, for the world's history, according to the teaching of Scripture, closes with a change in all these, but not their annihilation. What is affirmed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-10.htm">Job 14:10-12</a> of mankind in general, is, by the change to the plural in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>, affirmed of each individual of the race. Their sleep of death is &#1506;&#1494;&#1500;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-39.htm">Jeremiah 51:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-57.htm">Jeremiah 51:57</a>). What Sheo&#770;l summons away from the world, the world never sees again. Oh that it were otherwise! How would the brighter future have comforted him with respect to the sorrowful present and the dark night of the grave! </body></html>
