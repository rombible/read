Moreover, the water never fails from the sea, nor do great rivers like the Nile or the Euphrates ever dry up. The comparison that is implied, but not expressed, is one of contrariety. <span class= "ital">The waters will have failed from the sea, and the rivers will have wasted and become dry, and yet the man who hath lain down </span>(<span class= "ital">in death</span>)<span class= "ital"> will not arise: i.e., </span>sooner than that shall happen, the sea will fail and the great rivers become dry. This appears to give a sense far better and more appropriate to the context. The Authorised Version obscures the obvious meaning of the passage by the introduction of the “as,” which is not wanted. There is no hope of any future life, still less of any resurrection here; but neither can we regard the language as involving an absolute denial of it. What Job says is equally true even in full view of the life to come and of the resurrection; indeed, there seems to glimmer the hope of an ardent though unexpressed longing, through the very language that is used. At all events, the statement uttered so confidently is not proof against the inevitable doubt involved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-14.htm" title="If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.">Job 14:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-11.htm" title="As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decays and dries up:">Job 14:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">As the waters fail from the sea — </span>This may mean, either, 1st, <span class="ital">As the waters go, </span>or <span class="ital">flow out from the sea, </span>and return not thither again, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-7.htm" title="All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; to the place from where the rivers come, thither they return again.">Ecclesiastes 1:7</a> : or, 2d, <span class="ital">As waters, </span>that is, some portion of the waters, are exhaled from the sea by the sun, or are received and sunk into the dry and thirsty earth: or, 3d, As the waters of the sea fail, when the sea forsakes the place into which it used to flow; <span class="ital">and the flood decayeth and drieth up — </span>As a flood, or a river, or a pond (for the word signifies any considerable confluence of waters) in a great drought decayeth, and is dried up, in which cases the same waters never return to their former places, so it is with man; when once the fountain of his life is dried up he dies, and never revives again as to the present life.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:7-15 Though a tree is cut down, yet, in a moist situation, shoots come forth, and grow up as a newly planted tree. But when man is cut off by death, he is for ever removed from his place in this world. The life of man may fitly be compared to the waters of a land flood, which spread far, but soon dry up. All Job's expressions here show his belief in the great doctrine of the resurrection. Job's friends proving miserable comforters, he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. If our sins are forgiven, and our hearts renewed to holiness, heaven will be the rest of our souls, while our bodies are hidden in the grave from the malice of our enemies, feeling no more pain from our corruptions, or our corrections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the waters fail from the sea - As the waters evaporate wholly, and leave the bottom wholly dry, so it is with man, who passes entirely away, and leaves nothing. But to what fact Job refers here, is not known. The sea or ocean has never been dried up, so as to furnish a ground for this comparison. Noyes renders it, "the lake." Dr. Good, without the slightest authority, renders it, "as the billows pass away with the tides." Herder supposes it to mean that until the waters fail from the sea man will not rise again, but the Hebrew will not bear this interpretation. Probably the true interpretation is, that which makes the word rendered sea (&#1497;&#1501;  ya&#770;m) refer to a lake, or a stagnant pool; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>, note.

It is also employed to denote the brass sea that was made by Solomon, and placed in front of the temple; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13</a>.

The allusion seems to be to the actual desiccation of seas and rivers. Job, apparently, had known instances of both. A formation of new land in the place, of sea is always going on at the head of the Persian Gulf, through the deposits of the Tigris and Euphrates; and this formation was very rapid in ancient times, when the head of the gulf was narrower. The desiccation of river-courses is common in Mesopotamia, where arms thrown out by the Tigris and Euphrates get blocked, and then silted up. <span class="cmt_word">And the flood decayeth and drieth up</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the</span> <span class="accented">river decayeth</span> etc. (see the comment on the preceding clause). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  4  Would that a pure one could come from an impure!<p>Not a single one -  - <p>  5  His days then are determined,<p>The number of his months is known to Thee,<p>Thou hast appointed bounds for him that he may not pass over:<p>  6  Look away from him then, and let him rest,<p>Until he shall accomplish as a hireling his day.<p>Would that perfect sinlessness were possible to man; but since (to use a New Testament expression) that which is born of the flesh is flesh, there is not a single one pure. The optative &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; seems to be used here with an acc. of the object, according to its literal meaning, quis det s. afferat, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-67.htm">Deuteronomy 28:67</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm">Psalm 14:7</a>.

Like the friends, he acknowledges an hereditary proneness to sin; but this proneness to sin affords him no satisfactory explanation of so unmerciful a visitation of punishment as his seems to him to be. It appears to him that man must the rather be an object of divine forbearance and compassion, since absolute purity is impossible to him. If, as is really the case, man's days are &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, cut off, i.e., &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, determined (distinct from &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; with an unchangeable Kametz: sharp, i.e., quick, eager, diligent), - if the number of his months is with God, i.e., known by God, because fixed beforehand by Him, - if He has set fixed bounds (Keri &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;) for him, and he cannot go beyond them, may God then look away from him, i.e., turn from him His strict watch (&#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>; &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>), that he may have rest (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;, cesset), so that he may at least as a hireling enjoy his day. Thus &#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; is interpreted by all modern expositors, and most of them consider the object or reason of his rejoicing to be the rest of evening when his work is done, and thereby miss the meaning.<p>Hahn appropriately says, "He desires that God would grant man the comparative rest of the hireling, who must toil in sorrow and eat his bread in the sweat of his brow, but still is free from any special suffering, by not laying extraordinary affliction on him in addition to the common infirmities beneath which he sighs. Since the context treats of freedom from special suffering in life, not of the hope of being set free from it, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-25.htm">Job 13:25-27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-3.htm">Job 14:3</a>, the explanation of Umbreit, Ew., Hirz., and others, is to be entirely rejected, viz., that God would at least permit man the rest of a hireling, who, though he be vexed with heavy toil, cheerfully reconciles himself to it in prospect of the reward he hopes to obtain at evening time. Job does not claim for man the toil which the hireling gladly undergoes in expectation of complete rest, but the toil of the hireling, which seems to him to be rest in comparison with the possibility of having still greater toil to undergo." Such is the true connection.<p>(Note: In honour of our departed friend, whose Commentary on Job abounds in observations manifesting a delicate appreciation of the writer's purpose and thought, we have quoted his own words.)<p>Man's life - this life which is as a hand-breadth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1</a>. is compared to a hireling's day, which is sorrowful enough - is not to be overburdened with still more and extraordinary suffering.<p>It must be asked, however, whether &#1512;&#1497;&#1492; seq. acc. here signifies &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, lxx), or not rather persolvere; for it is undeniable that it has this meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a> (vid., however Keil [Pent., en loc.]) and elsewhere (prop. to satisfy, remove, discharge what is due). The Hiphil is used in this sense in post-biblical Hebrew, and most Jewish expositors explain &#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; by &#1497;&#1513;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. If it signifies to enjoy, &#1506;&#1491; ought to be interpreted: that (he at least may, like as a hireling, enjoy his day). But this signification of &#1506;&#1491; (ut in the final sense) is strange, and the signification dum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-21.htm">Job 8:21</a>) or adeo ut (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-7.htm">Isaiah 47:7</a>) is not, however, suitable, if &#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; is to be explained in the sense of persolvere, and therefore translate donec persolvat (persolverit). We have translated "until he accomplish," and wish "accomplish" to be understood in the sense of "making complete," as <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>, Luther ("vollzhlig machen")  equals  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;. </body></html>
