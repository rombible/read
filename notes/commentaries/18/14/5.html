Every man of Adam's fallen race is short-lived. All his show of beauty, happiness, and splendour falls before the stroke of sickness or death, as the flower before the scythe; or passes away like the shadow. How is it possible for a man's conduct to be sinless, when his heart is by nature unclean? Here is a clear proof that Job understood and believed the doctrine of original sin. He seems to have intended it as a plea, why the Lord should not deal with him according to his own works, but according to His mercy and grace. It is determined, in the counsel and decree of God, how long we shall live. Our times are in his hands, the powers of nature act under him; in him we live and move. And it is very useful to reflect seriously on the shortness and uncertainty of human life, and the fading nature of all earthly enjoyments. But it is still more important to look at the cause, and remedy of these evils. Until we are born of the Spirit, no spiritually good thing dwells in us, or can proceed from us. Even the little good in the regenerate is defiled with sin. We should therefore humble ourselves before God, and cast ourselves wholly on the mercy of God, through our Divine Surety. We should daily seek the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and look to heaven as the only place of perfect holiness and happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seeing his days - are "determined" Since man is so frail, and so short-lived, let him alone, that he may pass his little time with some degree of comfort and then die; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19-21</a>. The word "determined" here means "fixed, settled." God has fixed the number of his days, so that they cannot be exceeded; compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>, and notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>.<p>The number of his months are with thee - Thou hast the ordering of them, or they are determined by thee.<p>Thou hast appointed his bounds - Thou hast fixed a limit, or hast determined the time which he is to live, and he cannot go beyond it. There is no elixir of life that can prolong our days beyond that period. Soon we shall come to that outer limit of life, and then we must die. When that is we know not, and it is not desirable to know. It is better that it should be concealed. If we knew that it was near, it would fill us with gloom, and deter us from the efforts and the plans of life altogether. If it were remote, we should be careless and secure, and should think there was time enough yet to prepare to die. As it is, we know that the period is not very far distant; we know not but that it may be very near at hand, and we would be always ready. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. determined&#8212;(Job 7:1; Isa 10:23; Da 9:27; 11:36).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His days; the days</span> or (as it follows) months of his life. <span class="ital">Are determined</span>; are by thy sentence and decree limited to a certain period. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With thee, </span> i.e. exactly known to thee, or in thy power and disposal.

Or "cut out" (i), exactly and precisely, how many he shall live, and what shall befall him every day of his life; whose life, because of the shortness of it, is rather measured by days than vents: <p>the number of his months are with thee; before him, in his sight, in his account, and fixed and settled by him: <p>thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; the boundaries of his life the period of his days, beyond which he cannot go; the term of man's life is so peremptorily fixed by God, that he cannot die sooner, nor live longer, than he has determined he should; as the time of a man's birth, so the time of his death is according to the purpose of God; and all intervening moments and articles of time, and all things that befall a man throughout the whole course of his life, all fall under the appointment of God, and are according to his determinate will; and when God requires of man his soul, no one has power over his spirit to retain it one moment; yet this hinders not the use of means for the preservation and comfort of life, since these are settled as well as the end, and are under the divine direction: the word for bounds signifies sometimes "statutes" (k): though not to be understood of laws appointed by God, either of a moral or ceremonial nature; but here it signifies set, stated, appointed times (l) Seneca (m) says the same thing; <p>"there is a boundary fixed for every man, which always remains where it is set, nor can any move it forward by any means whatsoever.'' <p>(i) "exacte praefiniti sunt", Tigurine version.

Job here returns to the consideration of the shortness of man's life. "His days are determined;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are a limited period, known to and fixed beforehand by God. They are not like God's days, which "endure throughout all generations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-24.htm">Psalm 102:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The number of his months are with thee</span>.

He does not know how to reconcile with the justice of God the fact that He again records against him sins, the forgiveness of which he implores soon after their commission, and decrees (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/149-9.htm">Psalm 149:9</a>, and as used elsewhere in the book of Job with reference to the recording of judgment) for him on account of them such bitter punishment (&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, amara, bitter calamities; comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>, "bitter" grapes). And the two could not indeed be harmonized, if it really were thus. So long as a man remains an object of the divine mercy, his sins that have been once forgiven are no more the object of divine judgment. But Job can understand his affliction only as an additional punishment. The conflict of temptation through which he is passing has made God's loving-kindness obscure to him. He appears to himself to be like a prisoner whose feet are forced into the holes of a &#1505;&#1491;, i.e., the block or log of wood in which the feet of a criminal are fastened, and which he must shuffle about with him when he moves; perhaps connected with Arab. sadda, occludere, opplere (foramen), elsewhere &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514; (from the forcible twisting or fastening), Chald. &#1505;&#1491;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1505;&#1491;&#1504;&#1488;, Syr. sado, by which <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>, &#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  equals  &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;, is rendered; Lat. cippus (which Ralbag compares), codex (in Plautus an instrument of punishment for slaves), or also nervus. The verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; which belongs to it, and is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm">Job 33:11</a> in the same connection, is of the jussive form, but is neither jussive nor optative in meaning, as also the future with shortened vowel (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-22.htm">Job 27:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>) or apocopated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-9.htm">Job 23:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>) is used elsewhere from the preference of poetry for a short pregnant form. He seems to himself like a criminal whose steps are closely watched (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-14.htm">Job 10:14</a>), in order that he may not have the undeserved enjoyment of freedom, and may not avoid the execution for which he is reserved by effecting an escape by flight. Instead of &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;, the reading adopted by Ben-Ascher, Ben-Naphtali writes &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;, with Cholem in the first syllable; both modes of punctuation change without any fixed law also in other respects in the inflexion of &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;, as of &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1492;, a caravan, the construct is both &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>, and &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;. It is scarcely necessary to remark that the verbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a> are addressed to God, and are not intended as the third pers. fem. in reference to the stocks (Ralbag). The roots of the feet are undoubtedly their undermost parts, therefore the soles. But what is the meaning of &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;? The Vulg., Syr., and Parchon explain: Thou fixest thine attention upon ... , but certainly according to mere conjecture; Ewald, by the help of the Arabic tahhakkaka ala: Thou securest thyself ... , but there is not the least necessity to depart from the ordinary use of the word, as those also do who explain: Thou makest a law or boundary (Aben-Ezra, Ges., Hahn, Schlottm.). The verb &#1495;&#1511;&#1492; is the usual word (certainly cognate and interchangeable with &#1495;&#1511;&#1511;) for carved-out work (intaglio), and perhaps with colour rubbed in, or filled up with metal (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-23.htm">Job 19:23</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a>); it signifies to hew into, to carve, to dig a trench. Stickel is in some measure true to this meaning when he explains: Thou scratchest, pressest (producing blood); by which rendering, however, the Hithpa. is not duly recognised. Raschi is better, tu t'affiches, according to which Mercerus: velut affixus vestigiis pedum meorum adhaeres, ne qu elabi possim aut effugere. But a closer connection with the ordinary use of the word is possible. Accordingly Rosenm., Umbreit, and others render: Thou markest a line round my feet (drawest a circle round); Hirz., however, in the strictest sense of the Hithpa.: Thou diggest thyself in (layest thyself as a circular line about my feet). But the Hithpa. does not necessarily mean se insculpere, but, as &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496; sibi exuere, &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1514;&#1495; sibi solvere, &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1504;&#1503; sibi propitium facere, it may also mean sibi insculpere, which does not give so strange a representation: Thou makest to thyself furrows (or also: lines) round the soles of my feet, so that they cannot move beyond the narrow boundaries marked out by thee. With &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>, a circumstantial clause begins: While he whom Thou thus fastenest in as a criminal, etc. Observe the fine rhythmical accentuation acha&#772;lo &#8219;asch. Since God whom he calls upon does not appear, Job's defiance is changed to timidity. The elegiac tone, into which his bold tone has passed, is continued in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14.htm">Job 14</a>. </body></html>
