He represents God as carrying matters to extremity against him. The Lord must prevail against all who contend with him. God may send disease and pain, we may lose all comfort in those near and dear to us, every hope of earthly happiness may be destroyed, but God will receive the believer into realms of eternal happiness. But what a change awaits the prosperous unbeliever! How will he answer when God shall call him to his tribunal? The Lord is yet upon a mercy-seat, ready to be gracious. Oh that sinners would be wise, that they would consider their latter end! While man's flesh is upon him, that is, the body he is so loth to lay down, it shall have pain; and while his soul is within him, that is, the spirit he is so loth to resign, it shall mourn. Dying work is hard work; dying pangs often are sore pangs. It is folly for men to defer repentance to a death-bed, and to have that to do which is the one thing needful, when unfit to do anything.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My transgression is sealed up - The verb rendered sealed up (&#1495;&#1514;&#1501;  cha&#770;tham) means to seal, to close, to shut up; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a>. It was common with the ancients to use a seal where we use a lock. Money was counted and put into a bag, and a seal was attached to it. Hence, a seal might be put to a bag, as a sort of certificate of the amount, and to save the necessity of counting it again.<p>In a bag -  - &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;  b&#305;&#770;tsero&#770;r. So Jerome, "in sacculo." So the Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;  en balantio&#772;. The word &#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;  tsero&#770;r means usually a "bundle" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-29.htm">1 Samuel 25:29</a>; Sol 1:13, or anything bound up (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-12.htm">Hosea 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-8.htm">Proverbs 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-35.htm">Genesis 42:35</a>; Sol 1:13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-20.htm">Proverbs 7:20</a>); but here it is not improperly rendered a bag. The idea is, that they were counted and numbered like money, and then sealed up and carefully put away. God had made an accurate estimate of their number, and he seemed carefully to guard and observe them - as a man does bags of gold - so that none might be lost. His sins seemed to have become a sort of valuable treasure to the Almighty, none of which he allowed now to escape his notice.<p>And thou sewest up mine iniquity - Noyes renders this, "and thou addest unto mine iniquity." Good, "thou tiest together mine iniquity." The word used here &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;  t&#803;a&#770;phal means properly to patch; to patch together; to sew to join together as carpenters do their work; and then to devise or forge - as a falsehood; - to join a malicious charge to a person. Thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-69.htm">Psalm 119:69</a>, "The proud have "forged a lie" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  t&#803;a&#770;phalo&#770; sheqer) against me," that is, they have joined a lie to me, or devised this story about me. So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>, "Ye are forgers of lies." The word does not occur elsewhere. The Greeks have a similar expression in the phrase &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;  raptein epe&#772; - from where the word &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  rapso&#772;dos. The word here, it seems to me, is used in the sense of sewing up money in a bag, as well as sealing it. This is done when there are large sums, to avoid the inconvenience of counting it. The sum is marked on the bag, and a seal affixed to it to authenticate it, and it is thus passed from one to another without the trouble of counting. If a seal is placed on the bag, it will circulate for its assigned value, without being opened for examination. It is usual now in the East for a bag to contain five hundred piastres, and hence, such a sum is called "a purse," and amounts are calculated by so many "purses;" see Harmer, ii. 285, Chardin, and Pict. Bible in loc. The sense here is, that God had carefully numbered his sins, and marked them, and meant that none of them should escape. He regarded them as very great. They could now be referred to in the gross, without the trouble of casting up the amount again. The sins of a man's past life are summed up and marked with reference to the future judgment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. sealed up&#8212;(Job 9:7).

Purses of money in the East are usually sealed.<p>sewest up&#8212;rather, "coverest"; akin to an Arabic word, "to color over," to forget wholly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Sealed up in a bag; </span> as writings or other choice things, that they may be safely kept, and all of them brought forth upon occasion, and not one of them forgotten or lost.

He dies, and then lies there completely broken down and melted away (&#1495;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;( yaw, in the neuter signification, confectum esse, rendered in the Targum by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; and &#1488;&#1514;&#1502;&#1511;&#1502;&#1511;). The fut. consec. continues the description of the cheerless results of death: He who has thus once fallen together is gone without leaving a trace of life. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-11.htm">Job 14:11</a>. this vanishing away without hope and beyond recovery is contemplated under the figure of running water, or of water that is dried up and never returns again to its channel. Instead of &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; Isaiah uses &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-5.htm">Job 19:5</a>) in the oracle on Egypt, a prophecy in which many passages borrowed from the book of Job are interwoven. The former means to flow away (related radically with &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;), the latter to dry up (transposed &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-14.htm">Jeremiah 18:14</a>). But he also uses &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, which signifies the drying in, and then &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, which is the complete drying up which follows upon the drying in (vid., Genesis, S. 264). What is thus figuratively expressed is introduced by waw (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>), similar to the waw adaequationis of the emblematic proverbs mentioned at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> : so there is for man no rising (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), no waking up (&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1509;), no &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;), and indeed not for ever; for what does not happen until the heavens are no more (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>, till the moon is no more), never happens; because God has called the heavens and the stars with their laws into existence, &#1500;&#1506;&#1491; &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-6.htm">Psalm 148:6</a>), they never cease (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>.), the days of heaven are eternal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a>). This is not opposed to declarations like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>, for the world's history, according to the teaching of Scripture, closes with a change in all these, but not their annihilation. What is affirmed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-10.htm">Job 14:10-12</a> of mankind in general, is, by the change to the plural in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>, affirmed of each individual of the race. Their sleep of death is &#1506;&#1494;&#1500;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-39.htm">Jeremiah 51:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-57.htm">Jeremiah 51:57</a>). What Sheo&#770;l summons away from the world, the world never sees again. Oh that it were otherwise! How would the brighter future have comforted him with respect to the sorrowful present and the dark night of the grave! </body></html>
