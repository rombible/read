The reader will observe, that all the great and sprightly images which thought can form of this noble animal are expressed in this paragraph with such force and vigour of style as (to use the words of an elegant writer) “would have given the great wits of antiquity new laws for the sublime, had they been acquainted with these writings.” It is true, in the third book of <span class="ital">Virgil’s Georgics, </span>we find a fine description of a horse, chiefly copied from Homer, of which Dryden has given us the following admirable translation: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">The fiery courser, when he hears from far <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sprightly trumpets and the shouts of war, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Pricks up his ears; and, trembling with delight, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Shifts place, and paws, and hopes the promised fight <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On his right shoulder his thick mane reclined <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ruffles at speed, and dances in the wind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His horny hoofs are jetty black and round;</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">His chine is double; starting with a bound <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Fire from his eyes, clouds from his nostrils flow; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He bears his rider headlong on the foe.</span></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, if the reader will compare with this the present passage, he will find that, “under all the disadvantages of having been written in a language little understood; of being expressed in phrases peculiar to a part of the world whose manner of thinking and speaking seems strange to us; and, above all, of appearing in a prose translation, it is so transcendently above the heathen description, that hereby we may perceive how faint and languid the images are which are formed by mortal authors, when compared with that which is figured, as it were, just as it appears in the eye of the Creator. He will observe in particular, that, whereas the classical poets chiefly endeavour to paint the outward figure, lineaments, and motions, the sacred poet makes all the beauties to flow from an inward principle in the creature he describes, and thereby gives great spirit and vivacity to his description.” <span class="ital">Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? — </span>A strong metaphor to denote force and terror. “Homer and Virgil mention nothing about the neck of the horse, but his <span class="ital">mane; </span>the sacred author, by the bold figure of <span class="ital">thunder, </span>not only expresses the shaking of that remarkable beauty in the horse, and the flakes of hair, which naturally suggest the idea of lightning; but likewise the violent agitation and force of the neck, which, in the oriental tongues, had been flatly expressed by a metaphor less bold than this.” <span class="ital">Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? — </span>Which is easily affrighted, and chased away by the least noise of a man. But, as the verb <span class="greekheb">רעשׁ</span>, <span class="ital">ragnash, </span>here used, signifies <span class="ital">to prance </span>or <span class="ital">move briskly, </span>as well as <span class="ital">to fear </span>and <span class="ital">tremble, </span>many prefer rendering the clause, <span class="ital">Hast thou made him to move like a grasshopper? </span>or, rather, <span class="ital">like a locust, </span>n as <span class="greekheb">ארבה</span>, <span class="ital">arbeh, </span>is generally translated. Thus S. Jarchi and Bochart, <span class="ital">An feciti ut moveretur sicut locusta? </span>Is it to be ascribed to thee that the horse hath such particular motions, leaping and prancing as the locusts do? Hence the saying, common among the Arabians, <span class="ital">The horse acts the locust. </span>The expression contains a two-fold beauty, as it not only marks the courage of this animal, by asking if he can be <span class="ital">affrighted, </span>but likewise raises a noble image of his swiftness, intimating that, if that were possible, he would bound away, with the nimbleness of the locust or grasshopper. <span class="ital">The glory of his nostrils is terrible — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">הוד נחרו אימה</span>, <span class="ital">hod nachro eimah, </span>literally, <span class="ital">The majesty, </span>or <span class="ital">magnificence, of his snorting is terror. </span>Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm" title="The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.">Jeremiah 8:16</a>, <span class="ital">The snorting of his horses was heard, the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones. </span>“This is more strong and concise than that of Virgil, which yet is the noblest line which was ever written without inspiration: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Collectumque premens, volvit sub naribus ignem.</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">And in his nostrils rolls collected fire.</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">He paweth in the valley — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">he diggeth; </span>through courage and wantonness, he cannot stand still, but is continually beating, and, as it were, digging up the earth with his feet. <span class="ital">And rejoiceth — </span>Glories, manifests great pride and complacency; <span class="ital">in his strength. He goeth on to meet the armed men </span>— He goes on with great readiness and undaunted courage to meet the weapons that oppose him. <span class="ital">He mocketh at fear — </span>At all instruments and objects of terror: he despises what other creatures dread; <span class="ital">neither turneth he back from the sword — </span>Or, <span class="ital">because of the sword, </span>or, <span class="ital">for fear of the sword, </span>as <span class="greekheb">מפני חרב</span>, <span class="ital">mippenee chereb, </span>often signifies. <span class="ital">The quiver rattleth against him — </span>The quiver is here put for the arrows contained in it, which, being shot against the horse and rider, make a rattling noise. <span class="ital">He swalloweth the ground with rage — </span>He is so full of rage and fury that he not only champs his bridle, but is ready to tear and devour the very ground on which he goes. Or rather, his eagerness to start, and his rage for the fight, are such that he, as it were, devoureth the intermediate space, and can scarcely wait for the signal for the battle, because of his impatience. <span class="ital">Neither believeth he, </span>&c. — He is so pleased with the approach of the battle, and the sound of the trumpet calling to engage in it, that he can scarcely believe, for gladness, that the trumpet hath sounded. Or, the words may be interpreted, <span class="ital">He cannot stand still when the trumpet soundeth: </span>his rider can hardly restrain or keep him still, through his eagerness to run to the fight. <span class="ital">He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha! </span>— An expression of joy and alacrity, declared by his proud neighings. <span class="ital">He smelleth the battle afar off — </span>He perceiveth, and has a kind of instinctive sense of the battle at some distance, either of place or time; <span class="ital">the thunder of the captains — </span>The loud and joyful clamour begun by the commanders, and continued by the soldiers, when they are ready to join battle, and when, with terrific shouts, they are marching to the attack. All these expressions, <span class="ital">“He rejoiceth in his strength — He mocketh at fear — Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet — He saith among the trumpets, Ha! ha! — </span>are signs of courage, flowing, as was said before, from an inward principle. His docility is elegantly painted in his being unmoved at the <span class="ital">rattling quiver, </span>the <span class="ital">glittering spear: </span>and the <span class="ital">shield. He swalloweth the ground, </span>is an expression of prodigious swiftness, in use among the Arabians, Job’s countrymen, at this day: it is the boldest and noblest of images for swiftness. The Latins have something like it; but it is not easy to find any thing that comes so near it as Pope’s lines in his <span class="ital">Windsor Forest: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">“Th’ impatient courser pants in every vein, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And, pawing, seems to beat the distant plain; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hills, vales, and floods, appear already cross’d, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And, ere he starts, a thousand steps are lost.”</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>See <span class="ital">Guardian, </span>No. 86, and Lowth’s <span class="ital">Prelectiones </span>34.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/39.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>39:1-30 God inquires of Job concerning several animals. - In these questions the Lord continued to humble Job. In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hast thou given the horse strength? - The incidental allusion to the horse in comparison with the ostrich in the previous verse, seems to have suggested this magnificent description of this noble animal - a description which has never been surpassed or equalled. The horse is an animal so well known, that a particular description of it is here unnecessary. The only thing which is required is an explanation of the phrases used here, and a confirmation of the particular qualities here attributed to the war-horse, for the description here is evidently that of the horse as he appears in war, or as about to plunge into the midst of a battle. The description which comes the nearest to this before us, is that furnished in the well known and exquisite passage of Virgil, Georg. iii.:84ff:<p> - Turn, si qua sonum procul arma dedere,<p>Stare loco nescitedmientauribns, et tremitartus,<p>Collectumq; premens volvit sub naribusignem.<p>Densa. iuba, et dextrojuctata recumbat in armo.<p>At duplex agitur, per lumbos spina; cavatque<p>Tellurem, et solidograviter sonat ungulacornu.<p>"But at the clash of arms, his ear afar<p>Drinks the deep sound, and vibrates to the war;<p>Flames from each nostril roll in gathered stream,<p>His quivering limbs with restless motion gleam;<p>O'er his right shoulder, floating full and fair,<p>Sweeps his thick mane, and spreads his pomp of hair;<p>Swift works his double spine; and earth around<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. The allusion to "the horse" (Job 39:18), suggests the description of him. Arab poets delight in praising the horse; yet it is not mentioned in the possessions of Job (Job 1:3; 42:12). It seems to have been at the time chiefly used for war, rather than "domestic purposes."<p>thunder&#8212;poetically for, "he with arched neck inspires fear as thunder does." Translate, "majesty" [Umbreit]. Rather "the trembling, quivering mane," answering to the "vibrating wing" of the ostrich (see on [556]Job 39:13) [Maurer]. "Mane" in Greek also is from a root meaning "fear." English Version is more sublime.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/39.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Strength; </span> either strength of body; or rather, courage and generous confidence, for which the horse is highly commended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With thunder, </span> i.e. with snorting and neighing; in the making of which nereid the neck, in regard of the throat, which is within it, and a part of it, is a principal instrument; which noise may not unfitly be called <span class="ital">thunder</span>, because of the great vehemency and rage wherewith it is attended, and the great terror which it causeth, especially in war and battle, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm" title="The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.">Jeremiah 8:16</a></span>; and compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-17.htm" title="Is it not wheat harvest to day?

Nor is this, as some allege, an improper speech, because this thunder or neighing is rather clothed with the neck, as being within it, <span class="ital">than the neck with it</span>; for nothing is more common in Scripture than to say that men are <span class="ital">clothed with righteousness</span>, <span class="ital">humility</span>, and other graces, which yet are in strictness of speech within the man, and not he within them. But because this word in this form is not elsewhere extant, some render it otherwise, <span class="ital">with a mane</span>, with a thick, and full and deep mane, as the phrase of being clothed with it implies; for this is mentioned by all writers of horses as a notable mark of a generous horse; which therefore they conceive would not be omitted here, where so many several properties and excellencies are described. And the verb <span class="ital">raam</span>, whence this comes, in the Syriac language signifies not only <span class="ital">to thunder</span>, but also to <span class="ital">be high</span> or <span class="ital">lofty</span>; which fitly agrees to the mane, which is in the highest part of the horse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/39.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hast thou given the horse strength?....

To the objection that the metaphor is "incongruous" (Professor Lee), it would appear to be enough to reply that one of our greatest prose-poets has seen in it peculiar fitness. <span class="accented">So true every way</span>" says Carlyle, on the passage: "true eyesight and vision for all things; material things, not less than spiritual; "the horse - Hast thou clothed his neck with <span class="accented">thunder?</span>" ('Lectures on Heroes,' p. 78). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/39.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13  The wing of the ostrich vibrates joyously,<p>Is she pious, wing and feather?<p>14  No, she leaveth her eggs in the earth<p>And broodeth over the dust,<p>15  Forgetting that a foot may crush them,<p>And the beast of the field trample them.<p>16  She treateth her young ones harshly as if they were not hers;<p>In vain is her labour, without her being distressed.<p>17  For Eloah hath caused her to forget wisdom,<p>And gave her no share of understanding.<p>18  At the time when she lasheth herself aloft,<p>She derideth the horse and horseman.<p>As the wild ass and the ox-like oryx cannot be tamed by man, and employed in his service like the domestic ass and ox, so the ostrich, although resembling the stork in its stilt-like structure, the colour of its feathers, and its gregarious life, still has characteristics totally different from those one ought to look for according to this similarity. &#1512;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, a wail, prop. a tremulous shrill sound (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-23.htm">Job 39:23</a>), is a name of the female ostrich, whose peculiar cry is called in Arabic zima&#770;r (&#1494;&#1502;&#1512;). &#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#1505; (from &#1506;&#1500;&#1505;, which in comparison with &#1506;&#1500;&#1509;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1494;, rarely occurs) signifies to make gestures of joy. &#1488;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-13.htm">Job 39:13</a>, is an interrogative an; &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, pia, is a play upon the name of the stork, which is so called: pia instar ciconiae (on this figure of speech, comp.
