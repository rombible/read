There is no Hebrew in the text for <span class="ital">gavest thou, </span>and Bochart, who says of this verse, <span class="ital">Vix ullus sit Scripturæ locus qui minus intelligatur, There is, perhaps, scarce any passage of Scripture which is less understood, </span>“seems to have proved beyond dispute,” says Dr. Dodd, “that the word rendered peacocks,” <span class="greekheb">רננים</span>, <span class="ital">renanim, </span>“signifies <span class="ital">ostriches, </span>and the following description entirely agrees with that opinion. Mr. Heath renders the verse, <span class="ital">The wing of the ostrich is triumphantly expanded, though the strong pinion be the portion of the stork and the falcon. </span>Dr. Shaw renders the verse, <span class="ital">The wing of the ostrich is quivering, </span>or <span class="ital">expanded, the very feathers and plumage of the stork; </span>and he observes, that the <span class="ital">warming </span>the eggs in the <span class="ital">dust, </span>or <span class="ital">sand, </span>is by incubation. In commenting on these verses it may be observed, says the doctor, that when the ostrich is full grown, the neck, particularly of the male, which before was almost naked, is now very beautifully covered with red feathers. The plumage likewise upon the shoulders, the back, and some parts of the wings, from being hitherto of a dark grayish colour, becomes as black as jet, while the rest of the feathers retain an exquisite whiteness. <span class="ital">They are, </span>as described <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-13.htm" title="Gave you the goodly wings to the peacocks? or wings and feathers to the ostrich?">Job 39:13</a>, <span class="ital">the very feathers and plumage of the stork; </span>that is, they consist of such black and white feathers as the stork, called from thence <span class="greekheb">πελαργος</span>, is known to have. But the belly, the thighs, and the breast, do not partake of this covering, being usually naked, and when touched are of the same warmth as the flesh of <span class="ital">quadrupeds. </span>Under the joint of the great pinion, and sometimes upon the lesser, there is a strong pointed excrescence, like a cock’s spur, with which it is said to prick and stimulate itself, and thereby acquire fresh strength and vigour whenever it is pursued.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/39.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>39:1-30 God inquires of Job concerning several animals. - In these questions the Lord continued to humble Job. In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The eagle and the hawk:<p>Is it by thy understanding that the hawk flieth,<p>And spreadeth his wings toward the south?<p>Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up,<p>And that he buildeth his nest on high?<p>He inhabiteth the rock and abideth there - <p>Upon the crag of the rock, and the high fortress.<p>From thence he spieth out his prey,<p>His eyes discern it from afar.<p>His young ones greedily gulp down blood;<p>And where the slain are, there is he.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. Rather, "the wing of the ostrich hen"&#8212;literally, "the crying bird"; as the Arab name for it means "song"; referring to its night cries (Job 30:29; Mic 1:8) vibrating joyously. "Is it not like the quill and feathers of the pious bird" (the stork)? [Umbreit]. The vibrating, quivering wing, serving for sail and oar at once, is characteristic of the ostrich in full course. Its white and black feathers in the wing and tail are like the stork's. But, unlike that bird, the symbol of parental love in the East, it with seeming want of natural (pious) affection deserts its young. Both birds are poetically called by descriptive, instead of their usual appellative, names.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/39.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Gavest thou:</span> the style of this book is very concise, and some verb is manifestly wanting to supply the sense; and this seems to be fitly understood out of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-19.htm" title="Have you given the horse strength? have you clothed his neck with thunder?">Job 39:19</a></span>, where it is expressed. <span class="ital">The goodly</span>; or, <span class="ital">triumphant</span>; that wherein it triumpheth or prideth itself. <span class="ital">Wings</span>, or <span class="ital">feathers</span>; Heb. <span class="ital">wing</span> or <span class="ital">feather</span>. The peacock’s beauty lies in its tail; which may well enough be comprehended under this name, as it is confessed that the Latin word <span class="ital">ala</span>, which properly signifies a <span class="ital">wing</span>, is used by Martial and Claudian to express the peacock’s tail. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The peacocks; </span> or, as some render it, <span class="ital">to the ostrich</span>, whose wings are much more great and goodly than those of the peacock. And for the other word in the next clause, which is rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ostrich, </span> they translate it another way; for that the Hebrew word <span class="ital">hasidah</span> doth not signify an <span class="ital">ostrich</span>, seems plain from the mention and description of that bird, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-17.htm" title="Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.">Psalm 104:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm" title="Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:7</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm" title="Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.">Lamentations 4:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-9.htm" title="Then lifted I up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.">Zechariah 5:9</a></span>, which doth not at all agree to the ostrich. And forasmuch as the following verses do evidently speak of the ostrich, and it is absurd to discourse of a bird which had not been so much as named, and consequently the name of it must be found in this verse, and there is no other word in this verse which bids so fair for it, it may seem probable that this word is not to be rendered the <span class="ital">peacock</span>, (though it be so taken by most,) but the <span class="ital">ostrich</span>. Nor is it likely that both the peacock and the ostrich should be crowded together into one verse, especially when all the following characters belong only to the latter of them. Add to this, that it is confessed, even by the Hebrew writers themselves, that there is a great uncertainty in the signification of the names of birds and beasts; and therefore it is not strange if many interpreters were mistaken in the signification of this word. Or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">wings and feathers unto the ostrich:</span> or, <span class="ital">or the wings or feathers of the stork</span> (or, <span class="ital">or</span>) <span class="ital">the ostrich</span>.

And this may be noted as a great and a remarkable work of God, that it should really have wings and feathers as other birds have, and particularly the stork, who comes nearest to it in bulk and colour, although otherwise, by its vast bulk, it might seem to be a beast rather than a bird, as it is also called by Aristotle, and Pliny, and others. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/39.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?.... Rather "ostriches", as the Vulgate Latin and Tigurine versions render it; some render it, "the wing of those that exult is joyful", so Montanus; that is, of the ostriches; who, in confidence of their wings, exult and glory over the horse and his rider, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18</a>; for peacocks are not remarkable for their wings, but for their tails; whereas the wings of the ostrich are as sails unto them, as several writers observe (k); and with which they rather run, or row, than fly: hence it is called by Plautus (l) "passer marinus", the sea sparrow: and the feathers of it are more goodly than those of the wings of the peacock; and besides, it is a question whether the peacock was where <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/54.htm">Job 54</a>ed, and in his times; since it is originally from the Indies, and from thence it was brought to Judea in the times of Solomon; and was not known in Greece and Rome (m) until later ages. Alexander the Great, when he first saw them in India, was surprised at them; and yet Solon (n) speaks of them in his time as seen by him, which was at least two hundred years before Alexander; though at Rome not common in the times of Horace (o), who calls a peacock "rara avis"; and speaks of them as sold for a great price; but ostriches were well known in Arabia, where <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/54.htm">Job 54</a>ed, as is testified by Xenophon (p), Strabo (q), and Diodorus Siculus (r). Moreover, what is said in the following verses is only true of the ostrich, and that only is spoken of here and there, as it follows; <p>or wings and feathers unto the ostrich; or whose wings and feathers are like the storks; and so Bochart renders the words, truly they have "the wing and feather of the stork"; the colours of which are black and white, from whence it has its name (s) in Greek; and so Leo Africanus (t) says of the ostriches, that they have in their wings large feathers of a black and white colour; and this was a creature well known in Arabia (u), in which <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/54.htm">Job 54</a>ed. <p>(k) Xenophon. de Expedit.

It is entirely distinct from the mah or baqar el-wahsh, wild ox, whose large soft eyes are so much celebrated by the poets of the steppe. This latter is horned and double-hoofed, and forms the transition from the stag to the ox distinct from the ri'm, &#1512;&#1488;&#1501;, therefore perhaps an antelope of the kind of the Indian nlgau, blue ox, Portax tragocamelus. I have not seen both kinds of animals alive, but I have often seen their skins in the tents of the Ruwal. Both kinds are remarkable for their very swift running, and it is especially affirmed of the fer that no rider can overtake it. The poets compare a troop of horsemen that come rushing up and vanish in the next moment to a herd of fer. In spite of its difficulty and hazardousness, the nomads are passionately given to hunting the wild ass, and the proverb cited by the Kms: kull es-se&#770;d bigo&#770;f el-fera&#770; (every hunt sticks in the belly of the fer, i.e., compared with that, every other hunt is nothing), is perfectly correct. When the approach of a herd, which always consists of several hundred, is betrayed by a cloud of dust which can be seen many miles off, so many horsemen rise up from all sides in pursuit that the animals are usually scattered, and single ones are obtained by the dogs and by shots. The herd is called gem&#305;&#770;le, and its leader is called &#8219;anu&#770;d (&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;),as with gazelles. - Wetzst.)<p>In Hebr. and Arab. it is &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; (fera&#770; or hima&#770;r el-wahsh, i.e., asinus ferus), and Aram. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1491;; the former describes it as a swift-footed animal, the latter as an animal shy and difficult to be tamed by the hand of man; "Kulan" is its Eastern Asiatic name. lxx correctly translates: &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is the acc. of the predicate (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-2.htm">Genesis 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>).
