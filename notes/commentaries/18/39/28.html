In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She dwelleth and abideth on the rock - "He rarely quits the mountains to descend into the plains. Each pair live in an insulated state, establishing their quarters on some high and precipitous cliff, at a respectful distance from others of the same species." "Edin. Ency." They seem to occupy the same cliff, or place of abode, during their lives; and hence, it is that they are represented as having a permanent abode on the lofty rock. In Damir it is said that the blind poet Besar, son of Jazidi, being asked, if God would give him the choice to be an animal, what he would be, said that he would wish to be nothing else than an "alokab," a species of the eagle, for they dwelt in places to which no wild animal could have access. Scheutzer, "Phys. Sac. in loc." The word rendered "abideth" means commonly "to pass the night," and here refers to the fact that the high rock was its constant abode or dwelling. By night as well as by day, the eagle had his home there.<p>Upon the crag of the rock - Hebrew, "Upon the tooth of the rock" - from the resemblance of the crag of a rock to a tooth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. abideth&#8212;securely (Ps 91:1); it occupies the same abode mostly for life.<p>crag&#8212;literally, "tooth" (1Sa 14:5, Margin).<p>strong place&#8212;citadel, fastness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/39.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which she doth partly for the security of herself and her young; and partly that she may thence have the better prospect to discern her prey, as it followeth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/39.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.

Arab. nach&#305;&#770;r, snoring, a rattling in the throat), Greek &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, Lat. fremitus (comp. Aeschylus, Septem c. Th. 374, according to the text of Hermann: &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;); &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;, however, might signify pomp (his pompous snorting), but perhaps has its radical signification, according to which it corresponds to the Arab. haw&#305;&#770;d, and signifies a loud strong sound, as the peal of thunder (haw&#305;&#770;d er-ra&#8219;d),' the howling of the stormy wind (haw&#305;&#770;d er-rija&#770;h), and the like.<p>(Note: A verse of a poem of Ibn-Dchi in honour of Dkn ibn-Gendel runs: Before the crowding (lekdata) of Taijr the horses fled repulsed, And thou mightest hear the sound of the bell-carriers (haw&#305;&#770;da mubershema&#770;t) of the warriors (el-mena&#770;ir, prop. one who thrusts with the lance). Here haw&#305;&#770;d signifies the sound of the bells which those who wish to announce themselves as warriors hang about their horses, to draw the attention of the enemy to them. Mubershema&#770;t are the mares that carry the bure&#770;shima&#770;n, i.e., the bells. The meaning therefore is: thou couldst hear this sound, which ought only to be heard in the fray, in flight, when the warriors consecrated to death fled as cowards. Taijr (Te&#770;ja&#770;r) is Slih the son of Cana'an (died about 1815), mentioned in p. 456, note 1, a great warrior of the wandering tribe of the 'Aneze. - Wetzst.)<p>The substantival clause is intended to affirm that its dull-toned snort causes or spreads terror. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21</a> the plur. alternates with the sing., since, as it appears, the representation of the many pawing hoofs is blended with that of the pawing horse, according to the well-known line,<p>Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum<p>(Virgil, Aen. viii. 596);<p>or, since this is said of the galloping horse, according to the likewise Virgilian line,<p>Cavatque<p>Tellurem, et solido graviter sonat ungula cornu<p>(Georg. iii. 87 f).<p>&#1495;&#1508;&#1512; is, as the Arab. ha&#770;fir, hoof, shows, the proper word for the horse's impatient pawing of the ground (whence it then, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-29.htm">Job 39:29</a>, signifies rimari, scrutari). &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; is the plain as the place of contest; for the description, as now becomes still more evident, refers to the war-horse. The verb &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;) has its radical signification exsultare (comp. Arab. s]ts, skirta'n, of the foetus) here; and since &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1495;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, is added to it, it is not to be translated: it rejoices in its strength, but: it prances or is joyous with strength, lxx &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b9;&#836;. The difference between the two renderings is, however, scarcely perceptible. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, armament, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21</a>, is meton. the armed host of the enemy; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, "the quiver," is, however, not used metonymically for the arrows of the enemy whizzing about the horse (Schult.), but <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-23.htm">Job 39:23</a> is the concluding description of the horse that rushes on fearlessly, proudly, and impetuously in pursuit, under the rattle and glare of the equipment of its rider (Schlottm. and others). &#1512;&#1504;&#1492; (cogn. of &#1512;&#1504;&#1503;), of the rattling of the quiver, as Arab. ranna, ranima, of the whirring of the bow when the arrow is despatched; to point it &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>), instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, would be to deprive the language of a word supported by the dialects (vid., Ges. Thes.). On <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-24.htm">Job 39:24</a> we may compare the Arab. iltahama-l-farasu-l-arda, the horse swallows up the ground, whence lahimm, lah&#305;&#770;m, a swallower  equals  swift-runner; so here: with boisterous fierceness and angry impatience (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1512;&#1490;&#1494;) it swallows up the ground, i.e., passes so swiftly over it that long pieces vanish so rapidly before it, as though it greedily sucked them up (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488; intensive of &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, whence &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, the water-sucking papyrus); a somewhat differently applied figure is nahab-el-arda, i.e., according to Silius' expression, rapuit campum. The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-24.htm">Job 39:24</a> is, as in Virgil, Georg. iii.:83f.:<p>Tum si qua sonum procul arma dedere,<p>Stare loco nescit;<p>and in Aeschylus, Septem, 375: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; (Hermann, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (impatiently awaiting the call of the trumpet). &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; signifies here to show stability (vid., Genesis, S. 367f.) in the first physical sense (Bochart, Rosenm., and others): it does not stand still, i.e., will not be held, when (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, quum) the sound of the war-trumpet, i.e., when it sounds. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; is the signal-trumpet when the army was called together, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>; to gather the army that is in pursuit of the enemy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-28.htm">2 Samuel 2:28</a>; when the people rebelled, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>; when the army was dismissed at the end of the war, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-22.htm">2 Samuel 20:22</a>; when forming for defence and for assault, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; and in general the signal of war, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>. As often as this is heard (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, in sufficiency, i.e., happening at any time  equals  quotiescunque), it makes known its lust of war by a joyous neigh, even from afar, before the collision has taken place; it scents (praesagit according to Pliny's expression) the approaching conflict, (scents even in anticipation) the thundering command of the chiefs that may soon be heard, and the cry of battle giving loose to the assault. "Although," says Layard (New Discoveries, p. 330), "docile as a lamb, and requiring no other guide than the halter, when the Arab mare hears the war-cry of the tribe, and sees the quivering spear of her rider, her eyes glitter with fire, her blood-red nostrils open wide, her neck is nobly arched, and her tail and mane are raised and spread out to the wind. The Bedouin proverb says, that a high-bred mare when at full speed should hide her rider between her neck and her tail." </body></html>
