But the soul is the life, the soul is the man, and this is the gift of God.

The fact that God had moulded the human form as the potter moulds the clay, is one that is often referred to in the Scriptures; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20-21</a>. The object of Job in this is, probably, to recall the fact that God, out of clay, had formed the noble structure, man, and to ask whether it was his intention to reduce that structure again to its former worthless condition - to destroy its beauty, and to efface the remembrance of his workmanship? Was it becoming God thus to blot out every memorial of his own power and skill in moulding the human frame? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. clay&#8212;Job 10:10 proves that the reference here is, not so much to the perishable nature of the materials, as to their wonderful fashioning by the divine potter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As the clay, </span> i.e. of the clay; the note of similitude here expressing the truth of things, as it doth <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a></span>, and elsewhere, as hath been before observed.

Not of the clay, though man was made originally of the dust of the earth, and the bodies of men are houses of clay, earthen vessels, and earthly tabernacles, but "as the clay"; either as the clay is wrought in the hand of the potter, and worked into what form, and made into what vessel he pleases, so are men in the hand of God, made by him in what form, and for what use and end he thinks fit; or rather this denotes not the likeness of the operation, but the likeness of the matter of the human body to clay: not for the impurity of it; for though man is in a state and condition comparable to the mire and clay, this he has brought himself into by sin, and not the Lord; he made man upright, but man has made himself sinful and polluted; but for the brittleness of it; as a vessel made of clay is brittle and easily broke to pieces, and cannot bear much weight, or any heavy stroke; so the body of man is weak and frail, and feeble; its strength is not the strength of stones, and its flesh brass, but clay: and this Job humbly entreats the Lord would "remember", and that "now" (h); immediately; and deal mildly and mercifully with him, since he was not able to bear the weight of his hand, which would soon, crush him and break him to pieces; not that God forgets this, for he remembers man's frame and composition, that he is but dust; that he is flesh, and a wind or vapour that passes away: but he may seem to do so, when he sorely afflicts, and his hand lies heavy, and he does not remove it, but continues it, and rather in creases the affliction; and therefore, as the Lord allows his people to put him in remembrance, Job here desires that he would show himself, in his providential dealings with him, that he was mindful of his natural frailty and infirmity; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a> <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3</a>, <p>and wilt thou bring me into dust again? to the dust of death; to the original of which he was made; and that so soon, and at once; or, "and unto dust will return me?" as Mr. Broughton and others (i), according to the original sentence, "dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return", <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; and which Job expected, and will be the case of all men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>; and therefore he thought that this might suffice, that it was enough that he should die in a little while through the course of nature, and therefore desires he might have some respite and ease while he did live; he could not see there was any occasion to press him so hard, and follow him so close with afflictions one after another, or be so rough with him and quick upon him; since in a short time his brittle clay would break of itself, and he should drop into the dust and lie decaying there, as it was of old decreed he should. <p>(h) "nunc", Drusius; so the Targum.

These attempts at explanation, however, are at once destroyed, because they proceed upon conceptions which are unworthy of God, and opposed to His nature. Firstly, Whether it gives Him pleasure (&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, agreeable, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-9.htm">Job 13:9</a>) when He oppresses, when He despises, i.e., keeps down forcibly or casts from Him as hateful (&#1502;&#1488;&#1505;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm">Psalm 89:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>) the work of His hand; while, on the contrary, He permits light to shine from above upon the design of the wicked, i.e., favours it? Man is called the &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506; of the divine hands, as though he were elaborated by them, because at his origin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), the continuation of which is the development in the womb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>), he came into existence in a remarkable manner by the directly personal, careful, and, so to speak, skilful working of God. That it is the morally innocent which is here described, may be seen not only from the contrast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>), but also from the fact that he only can be spoken of as oppressed and rejected. Moreover, "the work of Thy hands" involves a negative reply to the question. Such an unloving mood of self-satisfaction is contrary to the bounty and beneficence of that love to which man owes his existence. Secondly, Whether God has eyes of flesh, i.e., of sense, which regard only the outward appearance, without an insight into the inner nature, or whether He sees as mortals see, i.e., judges, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-15.htm">John 8:15</a>)? Mercier correctly: num ex facie judicas, ut affectibus ducaris more hominum. This question also supplies its own negative; it is based upon the thought that God lookest on the heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). Thirdly, Whether His life is like to the brevity of man's life, so that He is not able to wait until a man's sin manifests itself, but must institute such a painful course of investigation with him, in order to extort from him as quickly as possible a confession of it? Suffering appears here to be a means of inquisition, which is followed by the final judgment when the guilt is proved. What is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a> puts this supposition aside also as inconceivable. Such a mode of proceeding may be conceived of in a mortal ruler, who, on account of his short-sightedness, seeks to bring about by severe measures that which was at first only conjecture, and who, from the apprehension that he may not witness that vengeance in which he delights, hastens forward the criminal process as much as possible, in order that his victim may not escape him. God, however, to whom belongs absolute knowledge and absolute power, would act thus, although, etc. &#1506;&#1500;, although, notwithstanding (proceeding from the signification, besides, insuper), as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-6.htm">Job 34:6</a>. God knows even from the first that he (Job) will not appear as a guilty person (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-29.htm">Job 9:29</a>); and however that may be, He is at all events sure of him, for nothing escapes the hand of God.<p>That operation of the divine love which is first echoed in "the labour of Thy hands," is taken up in the following strophe, and, as Job contemplates it, his present lot seems to him quite incomprehensible. </body></html>
