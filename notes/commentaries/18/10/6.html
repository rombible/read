This is what Job utterly denies and disclaims, though he nowhere arrogates to himself perfect innocence or freedom from sin.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 Job, being weary of his life, resolves to complain, but he will not charge God with unrighteousness. Here is a prayer that he might be delivered from the sting of his afflictions, which is sin. When God afflicts us, he contends with us; when he contends with us, there is always a reason; and it is desirable to know the reason, that we may repent of and forsake the sin for which God has a controversy with us. But when, like Job, we speak in the bitterness of our souls, we increase guilt and vexation. Let us harbour no hard thoughts of God; we shall hereafter see there was no cause for them. Job is sure that God does not discover things, nor judge of them, as men do; therefore he thinks it strange that God continues him under affliction, as if he must take time to inquire into his sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That thou inquirest after mine iniquity - Art thou governed by hu man passions and prejudices, that thou dost thus seem to search out every little obliquity and error? Job here evidently refers to the conduct of man in strictly marking faults, and in being unwilling to forgive; and he asks whether it is possible that God could be governed by such feelings as these. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6.

Narrowly examined every action of his life, to find something amiss in them; and took notice of every weakness and infirmity, and aggravated it, to make it appear as sinful as it could be, and watched every halting and failing, that he might have something against him as a reason why he afflicted him; dealing with him as if there was no Messiah, no Mediator, Redeemer, and Saviour, provided, appointed, and promised; and as if there was no forgiveness of sin, through him, for him: sin pardoned for his sake is covered, that when it is sought for it shall not be found; so that when it is not pardoned, or not thought to be so, it lies open, and upon inquiry to be found, charged, and punished for; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>; this search and inquiry seems to have been made by afflictions; at least Job imagined that the design of God in them was to put him upon the rack, and bring him to a confession of sin, find in this way find an occasion against him: now such a method as this, Job thought, was unbecoming the greatness, majesty, and perfections of God; and was quite needless, since his eyes were not human nor shortsighted, that obliged him to pore and pry into things, but were omniscient, and could see at once whether there was any evil way in him or not; nor was he as men, short lived, which obliged him to make use of his time while he had it, to get an advantage of another; and besides, such a method of acting seemed to him very extraordinary, when he full well knew he was an innocent person, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin</span>. It seems to Job that God must have been "extreme to mark what he has done amiss" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>), must have searched into  every corner of Ms life, and hunted out all his sins and shortcomings, to have been able to bring together against him a total commensurate or even approximately commensurate, with the punishment wherewith he has visited him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>34  Let Him take away His rod from me,<p>And let His terrors not stupify me.<p>35  Then I would speak and not fear Him,<p>For not thus do I stand with myself.<p>The two Optatives, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>., as is frequently the case with the Imper., are followed by the Cohortative as the conclusion (&#1488;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, therefore will I speak; whereas &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; might be equivalent to, in order that I may speak) of a conditional antecedent clause. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; is here the rod with which God smites Job; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>. If God would only remove his pain from him for a brief space, so that he might recover himself for self-defence, and if He would not stifle his words as they come freely forth from his lips by confronting him with His overwhelming majesty, then he would fearlessly express himself; for "not thus am I in myself," i.e., I am not conscious of such a moral condition as compels me to remain dumb before Him. However, we must inquire whether, according to the context, this special reference and shade of meaning is to be given to &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;. There is a use of &#1499;&#1503;  equals  nothing, when accompanied by a gesture expressive of contemptuous rejection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a> (&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>, as nothing); <p>(Note: In both these passages (to which Bttcher adds <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>, "so  equals  without anything further"), &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; has been considered to be the sing. of &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, gnats; but this sing. is an error, as &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1509;, formerly considered to be the sing. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;.
