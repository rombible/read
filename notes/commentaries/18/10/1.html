Here is a prayer that he might be delivered from the sting of his afflictions, which is sin. When God afflicts us, he contends with us; when he contends with us, there is always a reason; and it is desirable to know the reason, that we may repent of and forsake the sin for which God has a controversy with us. But when, like Job, we speak in the bitterness of our souls, we increase guilt and vexation. Let us harbour no hard thoughts of God; we shall hereafter see there was no cause for them. Job is sure that God does not discover things, nor judge of them, as men do; therefore he thinks it strange that God continues him under affliction, as if he must take time to inquire into his sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My soul is weary of my life - compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-16.htm">Job 7:16</a>. The margin here is, Or," cut off while I live." The meaning in the margin is in accordance with the interpretation of Schultens. The Chaldee also renders it in a similar way: &#1488;&#1514;&#1490;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1497; - my soul is cut off. But the more correct interpretation is that in our common version; and the sense is, that his soul, that is, that he himself was disgusted with life. It was a weary burden, and he wished to die.<p>I will leave my complaint upon myself - Noyes, "I will give myself up to complaint." Dr. Good, "I will let loose from myself my dark thoughts." The literal sense is, "I will leave complaint upon myself;" that is, I will give way to it; I will not restrain it; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>.<p>I will speak in the bitterness of my soul - See the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 10<p>Job 10:1-22.

And yet nothing of a temporal blessing is more desirable than life; every man, generally speaking, is desirous of life, and of a long life too; soul and body are near and intimate companions, and are usually loath to part; but Job was weary of his life, willing to part with it, and longed to be rid of it; he "loathed" it, and so it may be here rendered (x), he would not live always, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>; his "soul" was uneasy to dwell any longer in the earthly tabernacle of his body, it being so full of pains and sores; for this weariness was not through the guilt of sin pressing him sore, or through the horror of conscience arising from it, so that he could not bear to live, as Cain and Judas; nor through indwelling sin being a burden to him, and a longing desire to be rid of it, and to be perfectly holy, to be with Christ in heaven, as the Apostle Paul, and other saints, at certain times; or through uneasiness at the sins of others, as Isaac and Rebekah, Lot, David, Isaiah, and others; nor on the account of the temptations of Satan, his fiery darts, his buffetings and siftings, which are very distressing; but on account of his outward afflictions, which were so very hard and pressing, and the apprehension he had of the anger and wrath of God, he treating him, as he thought, very severely, and as his enemy, together with the ill usage of his friends. The Targum renders it,"my soul is cut off in my life;''or I am dying while I live; I live a dying life, being in such pain of body, and distress of mind; and so other versions (y): <p>I will leave my complaint upon myself: not that he would leave complaining, or lay it aside, though some (z) render it to this sense; rather give a loose to it, and indulge it, than attempt to ease himself, and give vent to his grief and sorrow by it; but it should be "upon himself", a burden he would take upon himself, and not trouble others with it; he would not burden their ears with his complaints, but privately and secretly utter them to himself; for the word (a) used signifies "meditation", private discourse with himself, a secret and inward "bemoaning" of his case; but he did not continue long in this mind, as appears by the following clause: or since I can do no other but complain; if there is any blame in it, I will take it wholly upon myself; complain I must, let what will be the consequence of it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-13.htm">Job 13:13</a>; though the phrase may be rendered, as it is sometimes, "within myself", see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>; (b); and then the sense may be, shall I leave my inward moan within myself, and no longer contain? I will give myself vent; and though I have been blamed for saying so much as I have, I will say yet more: <p>I will speak in the bitterness of my soul: as one whose life is made bitter, against whom God had wrote and said bitter things, and had brought bitter afflictions upon him, which had occasioned bitter complaints in him, as well as he had been bitterly used by his friends; and amidst all this bitterness he is determined to speak out his mind freely and fully; or to speak "of the bitterness" (c) of his soul, and declare, by words, what he in his mind and body endured. <p>(x)   "fastidit anima mea vitam meam", Beza, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

There is not much that is novel in the long expostulation, which mainly goes over ground covered in ch. 3, 6, and 7; but some new grounds are alleged as pleas for mercy, if not for justice. These are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he is God's gesture, and in the past (at any rate) has been the object of his care (vers. 8, 8-12); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that God must be above judging as man judges (vers. 4, 5); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that God knows his innocence (ver. 7); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that he (Job) is entirely in God's power (ver. 7). In conclusion, Job begs for a little respite, a little time of comfort (ver. 20), before he descends into the darkness of the grave (vers. 21, 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My soul is weary of my life</span>. This is better than the marginal rendering, and well expresses the original. It strikes the key-note of the chapter. I will leave my complaint upon myself; rather, I <span class="accented">will give free course to my complaint over myself</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> I <span class="accented">will allow myself in the expression of it</span> (see the Revised Version). Job implies that hitherto he has put some restraint upon himself, but now he will give full and free expression to his feelings. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>29  If I am wicked, why do I exert myself in vain?<p>30  If I should wash myself with snow water,<p>And make my hands clean with lye,<p>31  Then thou wouldst plunge me into the pit,<p>And my clothes would abhor me.<p>32  For He is not a man as I, that I should answer Him,<p>That we should go together to judgment.<p>33  There is not an arbitrator between us<p>Who should lay his hand upon us both.<p>The clause with strongly accented "I" affirms that in relation to God is from the first, and unchangeably, a wicked, i.e., guilty, man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7</a>) (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to be a wicked man, means either to act as such <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>, or to appear as such, be accounted as such, as here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a>; Hiph., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20</a>, to condemn). Why, therefore, should he vainly (&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, acc. adv., like breath, useless) exert himself by crying for help, and basing his plaint on his innocence? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a> the Chethib is &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;, the Keri &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;, as the reverse in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>; mo itself appears in the signification water (Egyptian muau), in the proper names Moab and Moshe (according to Jablonsky, ex aqua servatus); in &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;, however, the mo may be understood according to Ges. 103, 2. This is the meaning - no cleansing, even though he should use snow and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (a vegetable alkali), i.e., not even the best-grounded self-justification can avail him, for God would still bring it to pass, that his clearly proved innocence should change to the most horrible impurity. Ewald, Rdiger, and others translate incorrectly: my clothes would make me disgusting. The idea is tame. The Piel &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489; signifies elsewhere in the book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>) to abhor, not to make abhorrent; and the causative meaning is indeed questionable, for &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>) signifies loathing, as &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a>) covering, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-25.htm">Ezekiel 16:25</a> certainly borders on the signification "to make detestable," but &#1514;&#1506;&#1489; may also be in the primary meaning, abominari, the strongest expression for that contempt of the beauty bestowed by God which manifests itself by prostitution. Translate: My clothes would abhor me; which does not mean: I should be disgusted with myself (Hirzel); Job is rather represented as naked; him, the naked one, God would - says he - so plunge into the pit that his clothes would conceive a horror of him, i.e., start back in terror at the idea of being put on and defiled by such a horrible creature (Schlottm., Oehler). For God is not his equal, standing on the same level with him: He, the Absolute Being, is accuser and judge in one person; there is between them no arbitrator who (or that he) should lay, etc. Mercier correctly explains: impositio manus est potestatis signum; the meaning therefore is: qui utrumque nostrum velut manu imposita coerceat. </body></html>
