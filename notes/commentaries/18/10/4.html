Here is a prayer that he might be delivered from the sting of his afflictions, which is sin. When God afflicts us, he contends with us; when he contends with us, there is always a reason; and it is desirable to know the reason, that we may repent of and forsake the sin for which God has a controversy with us. But when, like Job, we speak in the bitterness of our souls, we increase guilt and vexation. Let us harbour no hard thoughts of God; we shall hereafter see there was no cause for them. Job is sure that God does not discover things, nor judge of them, as men do; therefore he thinks it strange that God continues him under affliction, as if he must take time to inquire into his sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hast thou eyes of flesh? - Eyes like man. Dost thou look upon man with the same disposition to discern faults; the same uncharitableness and inclination to construe everything in the severest manner possible, which characterizes man? Possibly Job may have reference here to the harsh judgment of his friends, and means to ask whether it could be possible for God to evince the same feelings in judging of him which they had done. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6.

God has eyes, but not fleshly ones; he has eyes of love, grace, and mercy, which are always upon his people for good, and are never withdrawn from them; and he has eyes of displeasure and wrath on sinful men, to destroy them; these are not made of flesh, or like the eyes of flesh and blood, or of men; fleshy eyes cannot see at any great distance, and only in one place at a time, and only one object after another; they cannot see in the dark, and what they are, and only outward objects; and in these they are sometimes deceived, and at length fail: but the eyes of God see all things, at the greatest distance; he looks down from heaven, and beholds all the children of men on earth, and all their actions; his eyes are in every place, beholding the evil and the good; he can see in the dark as well as in the light, the darkness and the light are both alike to him; he beholds not only outward actions and visible objects, but the hearts of men, and all that is in them; nor is he ever deceived, nor will his sight ever fail: though Job, perhaps, may mean carnal eyes; that is, evil ones, as especially envious ones are: "is thine eye evil?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>; that is, envious; and it is as if Job should say, dost thou envy me my former prosperity and peace, that thou searchest so narrowly into my conduct to find iniquity in me, and take advantage against me? <p>or seest thou as man seeth? look with hatred and envy, as one man does upon another: so seemed the dispensations of God towards Job, as if he did, as he suggests. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hast thou eyes of <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</span><p>(g) Do you do this of ignorance.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

It is on this that Job now dwells. God, being so much above man, having eyes that are not of flesh, and seeing not as man sooth, ought not to judge as man judges, with partiality, or prejudice, or even with extreme severity (ver. 6). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>29  If I am wicked, why do I exert myself in vain?<p>30  If I should wash myself with snow water,<p>And make my hands clean with lye,<p>31  Then thou wouldst plunge me into the pit,<p>And my clothes would abhor me.<p>32  For He is not a man as I, that I should answer Him,<p>That we should go together to judgment.<p>33  There is not an arbitrator between us<p>Who should lay his hand upon us both.<p>The clause with strongly accented "I" affirms that in relation to God is from the first, and unchangeably, a wicked, i.e., guilty, man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7</a>) (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to be a wicked man, means either to act as such <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>, or to appear as such, be accounted as such, as here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a>; Hiph., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20</a>, to condemn). Why, therefore, should he vainly (&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, acc. adv., like breath, useless) exert himself by crying for help, and basing his plaint on his innocence? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a> the Chethib is &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;, the Keri &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;, as the reverse in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>; mo itself appears in the signification water (Egyptian muau), in the proper names Moab and Moshe (according to Jablonsky, ex aqua servatus); in &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;, however, the mo may be understood according to Ges. 103, 2. This is the meaning - no cleansing, even though he should use snow and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (a vegetable alkali), i.e., not even the best-grounded self-justification can avail him, for God would still bring it to pass, that his clearly proved innocence should change to the most horrible impurity. Ewald, Rdiger, and others translate incorrectly: my clothes would make me disgusting. The idea is tame. The Piel &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489; signifies elsewhere in the book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>) to abhor, not to make abhorrent; and the causative meaning is indeed questionable, for &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>) signifies loathing, as &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a>) covering, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-25.htm">Ezekiel 16:25</a> certainly borders on the signification "to make detestable," but &#1514;&#1506;&#1489; may also be in the primary meaning, abominari, the strongest expression for that contempt of the beauty bestowed by God which manifests itself by prostitution. Translate: My clothes would abhor me; which does not mean: I should be disgusted with myself (Hirzel); Job is rather represented as naked; him, the naked one, God would - says he - so plunge into the pit that his clothes would conceive a horror of him, i.e., start back in terror at the idea of being put on and defiled by such a horrible creature (Schlottm., Oehler). For God is not his equal, standing on the same level with him: He, the Absolute Being, is accuser and judge in one person; there is between them no arbitrator who (or that he) should lay, etc. Mercier correctly explains: impositio manus est potestatis signum; the meaning therefore is: qui utrumque nostrum velut manu imposita coerceat. </body></html>
