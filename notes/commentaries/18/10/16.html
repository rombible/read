His gloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribed to Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the sense of God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remaining depravity. Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earth renders the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition who are condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever?

But a somewhat different explanation is given to it by many interpreters. The word rendered "increaseth" (&#1490;&#1488;&#1492;  ga&#770;'a&#770;h) means properly, to lift up, to lift up oneself, to rise; and Gesenius supposes that it refers here to "the head," and that the meaning is, "if it lift up itself (sc. my head), thou huntest me as a lion." It cannot be denied that the notion of pride, elation, haughtiness, is usually connected with the use of the word, but it is not necessary here to depart from the common interpretation, meaning that the increase of his affliction greatly augmented his perplexity. Jerome, however, readers it, "and on account of pride, thou dost seize me as a lioness." The idea is, "my affliction, as it were, exalts itself, or, becomes more and more prominent." This is a better interpretation than to refer it to the raising up of his head.<p>Thou huntest me as a fierce lion - On the meaning of the word here rendered "fierce lion" &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1500;  shachal, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10</a>. The sense here is, that God hunted or followed him as a fierce lion pursued his prey.<p>And again thou showest thyself marvelous - Or rather, "thou turnest, and art wonderful toward me." The meaning is, that he did not at once spring upon his prey and then leave it, but he came back as if it had not been put to death when first seized, as if a lion should come back and torture his victim again. The meaning of the phrase "shewest thyself marvelous" is, that the dealings of God toward him were wonderful. They were wholly incomprehensible. He had no means of finding out the reasons of his doings. On the word used here, compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. increaseth&#8212;rather, "(if) I lift up (my head) Thou wouldest hunt me," &c.

That is, the affliction increaseth; which is a reason why pity should be shown him, seeing his troubles instead of abating were growing upon him; he had as much, or more, than he could well bear, and yet more was added to it; so that he was an object of compassion: or, "it lifteth itself up" (c); these proud waves of affliction rise, swell, and lift themselves on high, and threaten to overwhelm and utterly destroy; some render it as a "wish, oh, that it increased" (d); that it would come to its height, and quickly and at once put an end to this miserable life of mine: Job's affliction was a lingering one, it proceeded slowly; he wished it would make more haste, and become stronger, and soon dispatch him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <p>thou huntest me as a fierce lion; as the ramping shakal, as Mr. Broughton; the lion rampant, that is hungry, fierce, and ravenous, that pursues its prey with great eagerness, and never leaves till it comes up to it, when it seizes and devours it at once; or it, the affliction, hunteth me, pursues me closely, and will not leave, but threatens destruction to me; or rather, thou, that is God, who is often in Scripture compared to a lion, particularly when afflicting, or about to afflict the sons of men; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; some (e) interpret the words, as if Job was compared to a lion hunted by men, at which darts were cast, for which nets were prepared, and pits were dug: according to this sense Job was dealt with as if, in the time of his prosperity, he had been like a fierce and cruel lion, preying upon and oppressing others; now the Lord was taking methods with him, both to restrain him from hurting others, and to chastise him for what he had done to them: but it would be much better to consider this in a light more agreeable to Job's character as a good man, a righteous one, who is as bold as a lion, and fears nothing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>; and such an one was Job; and in his prosperity lifted up his head and walked boldly, and consequently not fearing the frowns of men, nor the malice of Satan; but now this lion was hunted by the Lord himself, and compassed with his net, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-6.htm">Job 19:6</a>; and to this sense is the version of Schultens, connecting the words with the preceding clause, "him therefore, who walked high as a lion, thou humblest"; he who before carried his head high, being afraid of none, is now hunted down, and lies low enough, prostrate and distressed: <p>and again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me; or, "thou returnest (f) and showest", &amp;c. after he had afflicted him in one way, he returned and afflicted him in another; and he not only repeated his afflictions, but devised new ways of afflicting him, uncommon ones, such as raised admiration in all beholders, as things rare and uncommon do: Job's afflictions were surprising ones; to be stripped at once of his substance, servants, children, and health; and it might be more wonderful to some, that God, so gracious and merciful as he is, should afflict in such a severe and rigorous manner; and especially that he should afflict so good a man, one so just and upright as Job was, in such a way: and it was even marvellous to Job himself, who was at a loss to account for it, not being conscious to himself of any gross enormity he had committed, or of a sinful course of life, or of anyone sin he had indulged to, wherefore God should come forth "against" (g) him as an enemy, in so terrible a manner: so some render the particle. <p>(c) "attollit sese", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; so Mercerus.

Thou huntest me</span>. This passage is very obscure, and has been taken in several quite different senses.

Thou huntest me;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou art continually pursuing me with thy plagues, thy "arrows" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>), thy" wounds" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>), thy poisoned shafts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>). Thou givest me no rest, therefore I am ever conscious of my afflictions. As a fierce lion. Schultens regards Job as the lion, and so Jarchi and others. But most commentators take the view that the lion is God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-10.htm">Lamentations 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7, 8</a>).

There are two poetical passages which treat explicitly of this mysterious existence: this strophe of the book of Job, and the Psalm by David, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a> (Psychol. S. 210). The assertion of Scheuchzer, Hoffmann, and Oetinger, that these passages of Scripture "include, and indeed go beyond, all recent systemata generationis," attributes to Scripture a design of imparting instruction, - a purpose which is foreign to it. Scripture nowhere attempts an analysis of the workings of nature, but only traces them back to their final cause. According to the view of Scripture, a creative act similar to the creation of Adam is repeated at the origin of each individual; and the continuation of development according to natural laws is not less the working of God than the creative planting of the very beginning. Thy hands, says Job, have formed (&#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, to cut, carve, fashion; cognate are &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1489;, without the accompanying notion of toil, which makes this word specially appropriate, as describing the fashioning of the complicated nature of man) and perfected me. We do not translate: made; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; stands in the same relation to &#1489;&#1512;&#1488; and &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; as perficere to creare and fingere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>). &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; refers to the members of the body collectively, and &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; to the whole form. The perfecting as clay implies three things: the earthiness of the substance, the origin of man without his knowledge and co-operation, and the moulding of the shapeless substance by divine power and wisdom. The primal origin of man, de limo terrae (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>), is repeated in the womb. The figures which follow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>) describe this origin, which being obscure is all the more mysterious, and glorifies the power of God the more. The sperma is likened to milk; the &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; (used elsewhere of smelting), which Seb. Schmid rightly explains rem colliquatam fundere et immittere in formam aliquam, refers to the nisus formativus which dwells in it. The embryo which is formed from the sperma is likened to &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, which means in all the Semitic dialects cheese (curd). "As whey" (Ewald, Hahn) is not suitable; whey does not curdle; in making cheese it is allowed to run off from the curdled milk. "As cream" (Schlottm.) is not less incorrect; cream is not lac coagulatum, which the word signifies. The embryo forming itself from the sperma is like milk which is curdled and beaten into shape.<p>The consecutio temporum, moreover, must be observed here. It is, for example, incorrect to translate, with Ewald: Dost Thou not let me flow away like milk, etc. Job looks back to the beginning of his life; the four clauses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a>, under the control of the first two verbs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>), which influence the whole strophe, are also retrospective in meaning. The futt. are consequently like synchronous imperff.; as, then, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a> returns to perff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a> describes the development of the embryo to the full-grown infant, on which Grotius remarks: Hic ordo est in genitura: primum pellicula fit, deinde in ea caro, duriora paulatim accedunt, and by <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a>, the manifestations of divine goodness, not only in the womb, but from the beginning of life and onwards, are intended. The expression "Life and favour (this combination does not occur elsewhere) hast Thou done to me" is zeugmatic: He has given him life, and sustained that life amidst constant proofs of favour; His care has guarded the spirit (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;), by which his frame becomes a living and self-conscious being. This grateful retrospect is interspersed with painful reflections, in which Job gives utterance to his feeling of the contrast between the manifestation of the divine goodness which he had hitherto experienced and his present condition. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>., &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, which Hirzel wrongly translates: and wilt now destroy me; it is rather: and hast now swallowed me up, i.e., drawn me down into destruction, as it were brought me to nought; or even, if in the fut. consec., as is frequently the case, the consecutive and not the aorist signification preponderates: and now swallowest me up; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a> (where, though not clear from the syntax, it is clear from the substance that &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is not to be understood as an imperfect, like the futt. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>.): wilt Thou cause me to become dust again? The same tone is continued in the following strophe. Thus graciously has he been brought into being, and his life sustained, in order that he may come to such a terrible end. </body></html>
