Job never gives up his faith in God, though, like Jacob, he wrestles with Him in the dark, and the issue shows that God is not displeased with such an unburdening of the soul that keeps close to the straight line of truth, which is, after all, one of the many manifestations of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/10-20.htm" title="Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,...">Job 10:20-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Are not my days few?

Those that are not duly thankful for constant ease should think how welcome one hour’s ease would be if they were in constant pain. <span class="ital">Before I go to the place whence I shall not return — </span>Shall not come back into this world and life. At death we must bid a final farewell to this world: the body must then be laid where it will lie long; and the soul appointed to that state where it must be for ever. That had need to be well done which is to be done but once, and done for eternity. <span class="ital">Even to the land of darkness, and the shadow of death — </span>That is, a dark and dismal shade. Holy souls at death remove to a land of light, where there is no death; but their bodies they leave to a land of darkness, and the shadow of death. <span class="ital">Of darkness, as darkness itself, </span>&c. — He heaps up expressions here to show that he has as dreadful apprehensions of death and the grave as other men naturally have, so that it was only the extreme misery he was in that made him wish for it. <span class="ital">Without any order — </span>No order is observed in bringing people to the grave, not the eldest are brought first, not the richest, not the poorest, and yet <span class="ital">every one in his own order, </span>the order appointed by the God of life. All lie there on the same level, and there is no distinction between the prince and the peasant; but <span class="ital">the servant is there free from his master: </span>and in the grave there is perpetual night, and no succession of day. <span class="ital">And where the light is as darkness — </span>Where there is no difference between light and darkness; where the day is as dark as the night; where there is nothing but perpetual and uninterrupted darkness. In the grave there is no knowledge, no comfort, no joy, no praising God, no working out our salvation, for <span class="ital">the night is come wherein no man can work. </span>Let us consider this, and therefore walk and work while we have the light with us. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:14-22 Job did not deny that as a sinner he deserved his sufferings; but he thought that justice was executed upon him with peculiar rigour. His gloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribed to Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the sense of God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remaining depravity. Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earth renders the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition who are condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever? Let every sinner seek deliverance from that dreadful state, and every believer be thankful to Jesus, who delivereth from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Are not my days few? - My life is short, and hastens to a close. Let not then my afflictions be continued to the last moment of life, but let thine hand be removed, that I may enjoy some rest before I go hence, to return no more. This is an address to God, and the meaning is, that as life was necessarily so short, he asked to be permitted to enjoy some comfort before he should go to the land of darkness and of death; compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>.

They are so, the days of every man are but few; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1</a>; the remainder of Job's days were but few; considering the course of nature, and especially the sore afflictions he had on him, it could not be thought his days on earth were many; in all likelihood, according to human probability, he had but a few days to live: or "are not my days a small little thing" (g)? it is as an hand's breadth, as nothing before God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>, <p>cease then; that is, from afflicting him; since he had so short a time to live, he requests there might be some intermission of his trouble; that he might have some intervals of comfort and refreshment, that not all his days, which were so few, should be spent in grief and sorrow: some connect this with the preceding clause, and which is most agreeable to the accents, "shall not the fewness of my days cease" (h)? I have but a few days, and these few days will soon cease; therefore give me some respite from my afflictions; and so the Targum,"are not my days swift and ceasing?" <p>and let me alone; do not follow me with afflictions, or disturb and distress me with them; but take off thine hand, that I may have some rest and ease; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-10.htm">Job 7:10</a>; or "put from me"; thine anger, as Kimchi, or thine army, as Junius and Tremellius; or thy camp, as Cocceius; that is, decamp from me, remove thy troops, the changes and war that are against me, by which I am besieged, surrounded, and straitened; let me be delivered from them: <p>that I may take comfort a little; that he might have some breathing time, some respite from his troubles, some refreshment to his spirit, some reviving to his fainting soul, some renewing of strength, before he departed this life; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>; so Aben Ezra and Gersom render it: "that I may be strengthened"; or that his heart might gather strength. <p>(g)   "nonne parum dies mei?"

Job here returns from vague longings and idle aspirations to actual realities - the facts of the case - and asks, "Is not the time that I now have to live short? Must not my disease make an end of me in a very brief space? If so, then may I not make a request? My petition is that God will 'cease' from me, grant me a respite, 'let me alone' for a short time, remove his heavy hand, and allow me to 'take comfort a little,' recover my strength, and obtain a breathing-space, before my actual end, before the time comes for my descent to Sheol," which is then (vers. 21, 22) described. The parallel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a> is striking. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13  And such Thou hast hidden in Thy heart,<p>I perceive that this was in Thy mind:<p>14  If I should sin, Thou wouldst take note of it,<p>And not acquit me of my iniquity.<p>15  If I should act wickedly, woe unto me!<p>And were I righteous, I should not lift up my head,<p>Being full of shame and conscious of my misery.<p>16  And were I to raise it, Thou wouldst hunt me as a lion,<p>And ever display on me Thy wondrous power,<p>17  Thou wouldst ever bring fresh witnesses against me,<p>And increase Thy wrath against me,<p>I should be compelled to withstand continuously advancing troops and a host.<p>This manifestation of divine goodness which Job has experienced from the earliest existence seems to him, as he compares his present lot of suffering with it, to have served as a veil to a hidden purpose of a totally opposite character. That purpose - to make this life, which has been so graciously called into existence and guarded thus far, the object of the severest and most condemning visitation - is now manifest. Both &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; refer to what is to follow: &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; used of the thought conceived, the purpose cherished, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-11.htm">Job 27:11</a>. All that follows receives a future colouring from this principal clause, "This is what Thou hadst designed to do," which rules the strophe. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-14.htm">Job 10:14</a> is to be rendered: If I had sinned, Thou wouldst have kept me in remembrance, properly custodies me, which is here equivalent to custoditurus eras me. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, with the acc. of the person, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a> (where it is followed by the acc. of the sin), is to be understood: to keep any one in remembrance, i.e., to mark him as sinful (Hirzel). This appears more appropriate than rigide observaturus eras me (Schlottm.). &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;, according to Ges. 121, 4, might be taken for &#1500;&#1497; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; (viz., &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;); but this is unnecessary, and we have merely translated it thus for the sake of clearness. His infirmities must not be passed by unpunished; and if he should act wickedly (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, of malignant sin, in distinction from &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;), woe unto him (comp. &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>). According to the construction referred to above, &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1514;&#1497; is praet. hypotheticum (Ges. 155, 4, a); and the conclusion follows without waw apodosis: If I had acted rightly, I should not have raised my head, being full of shame and conscious of my misery. The adjectives are not in apposition to &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (Bttcher), but describe the condition into which he would be brought, instead of being able (according to the ethical principle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>) to raise his head cheerfully. &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; constr. of &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, as &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; or &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;. It is needless, with Pisc., Hirz., Bttch., and Ewald, to alter it to &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, since &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is verbal adjective like &#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;. Moreover, &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; cannot be imperative (Rosenm., De Wette); for although imperatives, joined by waw to sentences of a different construction, do occur (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-2.htm">Psalm 77:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-3.htm">2 Samuel 21:3</a>), such an exclamation would destroy the connection and tone of the strophe in the present case.</body></html>
