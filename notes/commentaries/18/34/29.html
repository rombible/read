Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When he giveth quietness - That is, when God designs to give rest, comfort, ease, or prosperity in any way to a man. The Hebrew word used here may refer to any kind of ease, rest, or peace. The idea which Elihu intends to convey is, that God has all things under his control, and that he can bring prosperity or adversity upon an individual or a nation at his own pleasure.<p>Who then can make trouble? - literally, "Who can condemn, or hold guilty" - &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;  yara&#770;sha&#8219;. The sense is, that no one can overwhelm him with the consciousness of guilt, to whom God intends to give the peace resulting from his favor and friendship. Or, no one can bring calamities upon a man "as if" he were guilty, or so as to "show" that he is guilty, when God intends to treat him as if he were not. This is as true now as it was in the time of Elihu. When God designs to give peace to a man's soul, and to impart to him the evidence that his sins are forgiven, there is no one who can excite in his mind the conviction of guilt, or take away the comfort that God gives. When he designs to "treat" a man as if he were his friend, and to impart to him such evidences of his favor as shall convince the world that he is his friend, there is no one who can prevent it. No one can so calumniate him, or so prejudice the world against him, or so arrest the descending tokens of the divine favor, as to turn back the proof of the favor of God; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>.<p>And when he hideth his face - To "hide the face," is a common expression in the Scriptures to denote calamity, distress, and the lack of spiritual comfort, as the expression "to lift up the light of the countenance" is a common phrase to denote the opposite; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-24.htm">Job 13:24</a>.<p>Who then can behold him? - An expression denoting that no one can then have cheering and elevating views of God. No one can then have those clear conceptions of his character and government which will give peace to the soul. "This" is also as true now as it was in the time of Elihu. We are dependent on God himself for any just views of his own character, for any elevating and purifying conceptions of his government and plans, and for any consolation flowing in upon our souls from the evidence that he is our friend.<p>Whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only - The same truth pertains to nations and to individuals. The same laws respecting the sources of peace and happiness apply to both. Both are alike dependent on God, and neither can secure permanent peace and prosperity without him. Both are alike at his sovereign disposal; and neither can originate permanent sources of prosperity. This, too, is as true now as it was in the time of Elihu. Nations are more prone to forget it than individuals are, but still it is a great truth which should never be forgotten, that neither have power to originate or perpetuate the means of happiness, but that both are alike dependent on God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

For this <span class="ital">who</span> answers to the <span class="ital">who</span> in the former branch of the verse, and both of them speak of man and his act as opposed unto God and to his act. The case is the same in both: God can carry on his work, either of mercy or justice, as easily and as irresistibly upon a whole nation or people as upon one particular person. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?.... Quietness or peace is of God; external peace to bodies of men, to communities, civil and religious, and to particular persons; quietness and contentment in outward enjoyments, peace and safety at home, and from enemies abroad; inward spiritual peace, this is of God, is in Christ, and from him; is the fruit of his righteousness, spoke by his blood, comes through faith in Christ, and is enjoyed in his ordinances, and continues as long as it is the pleasure of God to give it, and cannot be disturbed by men or devils; a national peace, when God gives it, cannot be broke in upon; nor the peace of churches, though there are always some inclined to be troublers of the Israel of God; nor the peace of particular persons, not their outward peace and quietness, when God sets an hedge of providence about them; nor their inward peace, not by all the afflictions and persecutions they meet with in the world; nor by all the temptations of Satan, and the corruptions of their own hearts. The Targum is, "who shall condemn?" and so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions; when God acquits, absolves, and justifies men, who can condemn them? see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a>. When God pronounces the sentence of justification by the righteousness of Christ in the conscience of a sinner, it produces peace solid and substantial, and this being done, who shall condemn? or of what avail will their condemnation be? whether of the law, or of Satan, or of the world, or of themselves, of their own hearts; <p>and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only; whether God hides his face from a nation, as he sometimes did from the nation of Israel, because of their sins; when he would not hear their prayers, nor assist them against their enemies, nor arise for their help and deliverance out of their hands: or from his church and people, his spiritual Jacob and Israel, as when they complain, their way is hid from the Lord, and the Lord has forgotten and forsaken them; or from particular persons, as from David, Heman, and others; and who, of the Lord's people, but at one time or another are under the hidings of his face? and then there is no finding him, no looking to him with comfort and confidence; no looking into and beholding the works and ways of God, and the causes of his dealings with them; these are out of sight, his ways are in the deep, and his footsteps are not known. Some refer this to men; who will show favour to him whom God frowns upon? who will look at him in a pleasant manner, when God hides his face from him? <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. Here <span class="ital">he</span>, God, is emphatic. Elihu while upholding the rectitude Of God conjoins with it His sovereignty. To <span class="ital">give quietness</span> or rest seems to mean to give peace and security from oppression, when the oppressed cry unto Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm" title="So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.">Jdg 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-7.htm" title="The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.">Isaiah 14:7</a>). The antithesis to this is <span class="ital">He hides His face</span>, words which always mean, He withdraws His favour or help in anger, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-24.htm" title="Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?">Job 13:24</a>; and to <span class="ital">behold Him</span> has of course a sense the opposite of this, viz. to obtain His favour, to make Him gracious. God acts in both ways in His sovereign rule, and when He acts in the one way who shall condemn Him, and in the other who shall compel Him to alter His aspect? And thus He acts on the widest stage and in the most particular instance, with nations and men alike.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">29–33</span>. The connexion of the following verses is rather uncertain. The sense of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-30.htm" title="That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.">Job 34:30</a></span> might suggest the connexion of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-29.htm" title="When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:...">Job 34:29-30</a></span> with the preceding. In this case <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-31.htm" title="Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:">Job 34:31</a></span> would make a new start, and the connexion would be maintained to the end of the chapter. It is probable, however, that <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-34.htm" title="Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man listen to me....">Job 34:34-37</a></span> should be taken by themselves. In <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-29.htm" title="When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:">Job 34:29</a></span> the word he is emphatic; similarly in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-31.htm" title="Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:">Job 34:31</a></span> an emphasis falls on <span class="ital">God</span>. This common emphasis, in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-29.htm" title="When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:...">Job 34:29-30</a></span> on the absoluteness of God’s operation and in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-31.htm" title="Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:...">Job 34:31-33</a></span> on the presumption of any one who questions it, seems to bind these two groups of verses together.

None nan behold him when he hides himself; none can do more than deprecate his anger, and pray, "Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only</span>. The results are similar, whether God withdraws the light of his countenance from a nation or from an individual.
