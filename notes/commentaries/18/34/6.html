The plainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart is sanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures, can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion, better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spoken as if he meant wholly to justify himself. He that say, I have cleansed my hands in vain, does not only offend against God's children, Ps 73:13-15, but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Should I lie against my right? - These are also quoted as the words of Job, and as a part of the erroneous opinions on which Elihu proposes to comment. These words do not occur, however, as used by Job respecting himself, and Elihu must be understood to refer to what he regarded as the general strain of the argument maintained by him. In regard to the meaning of the words, there have been various opinions. Jerome renders them, "For in judging me there is falsehood - mendacium est; my violent arrow (the painful arrow in me) is without any sin." The Septuagint, "He the Lord hath been false in my accusation" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  epseusato de to&#772; krimati mou - "my arrow is heavy without transgression." Coverdale, "I must needs be a liar, though my cause be right." Umbreit renders it, "I must lie if I should acknowledge myself to be guilty."<p>Noyes, "Though I am innocent, I am made a liar." Prof. Lee, "Should I lie respecting my case? mine arrow is mortal without transgression." That is, Job said he could not lie about it; he could use no language that would deceive. He felt that a mortal arrow had reached him without transgression, or without any adequate cause. Rosenmuller renders it, "However just may be my cause, I appear to be a liar." That is, he was regarded as guilty, and treated accordingly, however conscious he might be of innocence, and however strenuously he might maintain that he was not guilty. The meaning probably is, "I am held to be a liar. I defend myself; go over my past life; state my course of conduct; meet the accusations of my friends, but in all this I am still held to be a liar. My friends so regard me - for they will not credit my statements, and they go on still to argue as if I was the most guilty of mortals. And God also in this holds me to be a liar, for he treats me constantly as if I were guilty. He hears not my vindication, and he inflicts pain and woe upon me as if all that I had said about my own integrity were false, and I were one of the most abandoned of mortals, so that on all hands I am regarded and treated as if I were basely false." The literal translation of the Hebrew is, "Concerning my judgment (or my cause) I am held to be a liar."<p>My wound is incurable - Margin, as in Hebrew "arrow." The idea is, that a deadly arrow had smitten him, which could not be extracted. So in Virgil:<p>Haeret lateri letalis arundo. Aeneid iv. 73.<p>The image is taken from an animal that had been pierced with a deadly arrow.<p>Without transgression - Without any sin that deserved such treatment. Job did not claim to be absolutely perfect; he maintained only that the sufferings which he endured were no proper proof of his character; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Were I to renounce my right (that is, confess myself guilty), I should die. Job virtually had said so (Job 27:4, 5; 6:28). Maurer, not so well, "Notwithstanding my right (innocence) I am treated as a liar," by God, by His afflicting me.<p>my wound&#8212;literally, "mine arrow," namely, by which I am pierced. So "my stroke" ("hand," Job 23:2, Margin).

No; I ought not: this though Job had not said in so many words, yet this seems to be his sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-4.htm">Job 27:4</a>; that should he own and say that he was a wicked man, a hypocrite, and destitute of the grace of God, he should not only speak against himself, but, contrary to his conscience, say an untruth, and not do justice to his character. Some read the words without an interrogation, as Mr. Broughton, <p>"for my right I must be a liar;'' <p>that is, for vindicating my right, seeking and endeavouring to do myself justice, and clear myself from false imputations, I am reckoned a liar. And to this purpose is the paraphrase of Aben Ezra, <p>"because I seek judgment, they say that I lie.'' <p>Others render them, "there is a lie in judging me", so the Vulgate Latin version; that is, <p>"I am falsely accused, I am judged wrongfully:'' <p>things I know not are laid to my charge, which has often been the case of good men: or, "I have lied in judgment"; that is, "failed", as the word is sometimes used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>; failed in his expectation of judgment or of justice being done him; he looked for it, but was disappointed; but the first sense seems best; <p>my wound is incurable without transgression; not that he thought himself without transgression, but that his wound or stroke inflicted on him, or the afflictions he was exercised with, were without cause; were not for any injustice in his hands, or wickedness that he had committed; and that he utterly despaired of being rid of them, or restored to his former health and prosperity; and to this sense he had expressed himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>. In the Hebrew text it is, "my arrow" (y), that is, the arrow that was in him, the arrows of the Lord that stuck fast in him; these were thrown at him and fastened in him without cause; and there was no hope of their being drawn out, or of the wounds made by them being healed; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>. Now what Elihu was offended at in these expressions was, that Job should so rigidly insist on his innocence, and not own himself faulty in any respect; nor allow there was any cause for his afflictions, nor entertain any hope of the removal of them: whereas it became him to acknowledge his sins, which no man is free from, and that he was dealt with less than his iniquities deserved; and that, instead of indulging despair, he should rather say, "I will return" to the Lord; he hath "torn" and he will "heal", he hath "smitten" and he will "bind up", <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>. <p>(y) "sagitta mea", Montanus, Schultens, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Should I lie against my <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> right? my wound <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> incurable without transgression.</span><p>(d) Should I say, I am wicked, being an innocent?<p>(e) I am more punished, than my sin deserves.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">should I lie against my right?</span>] This sense is possible, the meaning being, “shall I admit guilt when I am not guilty but wrongly afflicted”? Perhaps the sense is rather: <span class="ital">against</span> (or, notwithstanding) <span class="ital">my right I am made to lie</span>: when I affirm my rectitude God’s treatment of me belies my affirmations by making me guilty, and this against my right; comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-20.htm" title="If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.">Job 9:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-8.htm" title="And you have filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me bears witness to my face.">Job 16:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my wound</span>] lit. <span class="ital">my arrow</span>, the arrow of divine affliction infixed in me, comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm" title="For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinks up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.">Job 6:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm" title="His archers compass me round about, he splits my reins asunder, and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.">Job 16:13</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Should I lie against my right?</span> This was an essential portion of Job's argument (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-4.htm">Job 27:4</a>). Against the theory of his secret heinous wickedness put forward by his "comforters," he maintained consistently his freedom from conscious deliberate opposition to the will of God, and refused to make the confessions which they suggested or required, on the ground that they would have been untrue - in making them he would have "lied against his right." In this certainly Job "sinned not." But it was essential to the theory of Elihu, no less than to that of Eliphaz and his friends, that Job was suffering on account of past iniquity, whether he were being punished for it in anger or chastised for it in love (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-17.htm">Job 33:17, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My wound</span> (literally, <span class="accented">my arrow</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>) <span class="cmt_word">is incurable without transgression</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without my having committed any transgression to account for it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>29  Behold, God doeth all<p>Twice, thrice with man,<p>30  To bring back his soul from the pit,<p>That it may become light in the light of life.<p>31  Listen, O Job, hearken to me;<p>Be silent and let me speak on.<p>32  Yet if thou hast words, answer me;<p>Speak, for I desire thy justification.<p>33  If not, hearken thou to me;<p>Be silent and I will teach thee wisdom.<p>After having described two prominent modes of divine interposition for the moral restoration and welfare of man, he adds, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>, that God undertakes (observe the want of parallelism in the distich, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>) everything with a man twice or thrice (asyndeton, as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>, in the sense of bis terve) in order to bring back his soul from the pit (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, here for the fifth time in this speech, without being anywhere interchanged with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; or another synonym, which is remarkable), that it, having hitherto been encompassed by the darkness of death, may be, or become, light (&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, inf. Niph., syncopated from &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, Ew. 244, b) in the light of life (as it were bask in the new and restored light of life) - it does not always happen, for these are experiences of no ordinary kind, which interrupt the daily course of life; and it is not even repeated again and again constantly, for if it is without effect the first time, it is repeated a second or third time, but it has an end if the man trifles constantly with the disciplinary work of grace which designs his good. Finally, Elihu calls upon Job quietly to ponder this, that he may proceed; nevertheless, if he has words, i.e., if he thinks he is able to advance any appropriate objections, he is continually to answer him (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with acc. of the person, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>), for he (Elihu) would willingly justify him, i.e., he would gladly be in the position to be able to acknowledge Job to be right, and to have the accusation dispensed with. Hirz. and others render falsely: I wish thy justification, i.e., thou shouldst justify thyself; in this case &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; ought to be supplied, which is unnecessary: &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, without a change of subject, has the inf. constr. here without &#1500;, as it has the inf. absol. in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1511; signifies to vindicate (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>), or acknowledge to be in the right (as the Piel of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-12.htm">Job 33:12</a>), both of which are blended here.

He regards Elihu as the type of the false wisdom of the heathen, which fails to recognise and persecutes the servant of God: Sunt alii extra ecclesiam, qui Christo ejusque ecclesiae similiter adversantur, quorum imaginem praetulit Balaam ille ariolus, qui et Elieu sicut patrum traditio habet (Balaam and Elihu, one person - a worthless conceit repeated in the Talmud and Midrash), qui contra ipsum sanctum Iob multa improbe et injuriose locutus est, in tantum ut etiam displiceret in una ejus et indisciplinata loquacitas.<p>(Note: Bedae Opp. ed.
