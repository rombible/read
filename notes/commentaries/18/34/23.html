This is probably the meaning, as the Authorised Version; but some render, “He needeth not yet again to consider a man that he should go before God in judgment.” He hath no need to consider any man’s case twice or to rectify His first decision. He is infallible, and cannot do otherwise than right, whatever He does.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:16-30 Elihu appeals directly to Job himself. Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he will not lay upon man more than right - Very various translations have been given of this verse. According to our common version, it means that God will not deal with man in such a manner as to give him just reason for calling in question the rectitude of the divine dealings. He shall in no case receive more than his sins deserve, so as to give him cause for complaint. This is undoubtedly a correct sentiment; but it may be doubted whether it is the sense conveyed by the original. Umbreit renders it:<p>Denn er braucht auf einem Mann nicht lang zu achten<p>Um ihm vor Gott in das Gericht zn ziehen.<p>"For he needs not long to regard a man in order to bring him before God in judgment" - meaning that he has all power; that he can at once see all his character; and that he can bring him at once to his bar. This translation undoubtedly accords with the general scope of the argument. Noyes renders it:<p>He needeth not attend long to a man,<p>To bring him into judgment before God.<p>Wemyss renders it in a similar way:<p>He has no need of laborious inquiry,<p>In order to convict men at his tribunal.<p>Rosenmuller gives a similar sense to the passage. According to this, the meaning is, that there is no need that God should give long attention to a man, or go into a protracted investigation, in order that he may bring him to judgment. He knows him at a glance. He can at once convict him, and can decide the case in a moment without danger of error. Human tribunals are under a necessity of long and patient investigation, and then are often deceived; but no such necessity, and no such danger, pertains to God. This interpretation agrees with the scope of the passage (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-24.htm">Job 34:24</a>), and seems to me to be correct. The Hebrew literally is, "For not upon man will he place (scil. his mind or attention) long that he should go before God in judgment;" that is, there is no need of long and anxious investigation on his part, in order that he may prove that it is right for him to cut man off. He may do it at once, and no one has a right to complain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. (1Co 10:13; La 3:32; Isa 27:8). Better, as Umbreit, "He does not (needs not to) regard (as in Job 34:14; Isa 41:20) man long (so Hebrew, Ge 46:29) in order that he may go (be brought by God) into judgment." Literally, "lest his (attention) upon men" (Job 11:10, 11). So Job 34:24, "without number" ought to be translated, "without [needing any] searching out," such as has to be made in human judgments.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">More than right; </span> more or heavier punishments than they deserve, or than are proportionable to their sins, which he accurately observes, as was now said, and therefore can suit punishments to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That he should enter into judgment with God; </span> thereby to give him any pretence or occasion of entering into judgment with him, or condemning his proceedings; for which there might seem to be some colour, if God did lay upon man more than right.

Neither in a way of duty, his law being holy, just, and good, not any of his commandments grievous, but all his precepts concerning all things right, his yoke easy and his burden light; nor in a way of punishment, always punishing then less than their iniquities deserve; nor in a way of chastisement, suffering nothing to befall his people but what is common to men; and he is faithful to bear them up under it and through it, and to make a way to escape out of it: or the phrase, "than right", being a supplement, may be left out, and the words be connected with what follows, <p>that he should enter into judgment with God; and the sense is, either that God does not put it on man to go again into judgment with him; he does not suffer him to have a cause heard over again, to appeal from God or to him to have a second hearing; nor is anything to be got by it, he is in one mind, and none can turn him or reverse or get reversed any sentence of his; and therefore it was a piece of weakness in Job to insist so much as he did to have a hearing of his cause before him, since he could not expect there would be any alteration made in his favour: or, as Mr. Broughton reads it, "it is not for men to purpose to enter into judgment before the Omnipotent"; such a purpose is vain, he can never carry his cause against him; it is a piece of weakness to pretend to litigate a point with him: or the sense is, he puts no more on man than to come to him in judgment, so Schultens; he has appointed a person and time to judge the world in righteousness, and all must appear before his tribunal; and everything, thought, word and action, will then and there be brought into an account, and righteous judgment will pass; and therefore, since he has fixed such a method of proceeding, and requires no other, he can never be charged with injustice. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he will not lay upon man more <i>than right</i>; that he should <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> enter into judgment with God.</span><p>(q) God does not afflict man above measure so that he should have opportunity to contend with him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>.

He has no need to consider any man's case twice; he sees it at the first glance, and judges it infallibly. That he should enter into judgment with God, Were it not so, a man might perhaps claim to have a second trial, and, pleading in his own defence, might "enter into judgment with God," or (according to others) "go before God in judgment;" but God's absolute omniscience precludes this. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  And oh understand now, hear this;<p>Hearken to the sound of my words.<p>17  Would one who hateth right also be able to subdue?<p>Or wilt thou condemn the All-just?<p>18  Is it becoming to say to a king: Worthless One!?<p>Thou evil-doer! to princes?<p>19  To Him who accepteth not the person of rulers,<p>And regardeth not the noble before the poor:<p>For they are all the work of His hands.<p>20  In a moment they die, and at midnight<p>The people are overthrown and perish,<p>And they put aside the mighty - not by the hand of man.<p>This strophe contains several grammatical rarities. At first sight it appears that <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-16.htm">Job 34:16</a> ought to be translated: "and if there is understanding (viz., to thee  equals  if thou hast), then hear this." But &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is accented as Milel and with Mercha, and can therefore not be a substantive (Hirz., Hahn, and others); for the retreat of the accent would be absolutely incomprehensible, and instead of a conjunctive, a distinctive, viz., Dech, ought to be expected. Several of the old expositors, therefore, interpret with Nolde: quod quum ita sit, intellige; but this elliptical &#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, well as it might also be used for <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>, is unsupportable; the Makkeph between the two words is also against it, which rather arises from the assumption that &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is the imperat., and &#1488;&#1501; as an exception, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-13.htm">Genesis 23:13</a>, is an optative particle joined to the imper. 2 instead of to the fut.: "and if thou shouldst observe" ( equals  &#1493;&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;). To translate <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a> with Schultens: num iram osor judicii frenabit, is impracticable on account of the order of the words, and gives a thought that is inappropriate here. &#1488;&#1507; is a particle, and the fut. is potentialis: is it also possible that an enemy of right should govern? (&#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, imperio coercere, as &#1488;&#1510;&#1512;   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-17.htm">1 Samuel 9:17</a>, &#1488;&#1505;&#1512; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-22.htm">Psalm 105:22</a>); right and government are indeed mutually conditioned, without right everything would fall into anarchy and confusion. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a> this is applied to the Ruler of the world: or (&#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, an, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-9.htm">Job 40:9</a>) wilt thou condemn the mighty just One, i.e., the All-just?
