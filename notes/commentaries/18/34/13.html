Here he shows, that God did him no wrong by afflicting him. If the former did not satisfy him, this ought to silence him. God cannot do wickedness, nor the Almighty commit wrong. If services now go unrewarded, and sins now go unpunished, yet there is a day coming, when God will fully render to every man according to his works. Further, though the believer's final condemnation is done away through the Saviour's ransom, yet he has merited worse than any outward afflictions; so that no wrong is done to him, however he may be tried.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who hath given him a charge over the earth? - That is, he is the great original Proprietor and Ruler of all. He has derived his authority to govern from no one; he is under subjection to no one, and he has, therefore, an absolute right to do his own pleasure. Reigning then with absolute and original authority, no one has a right to call in question the equity of what he does. The argument of Elihu here, that God would do right, is derived solely from his independence. If he were a subordinate governor, he would feel less interest in the correct administration of affairs, and might be tempted to commit injuries to gratify the feelings of his superior. As he is, however, supreme and independent, he cannot be tempted to do wrong by any reference to a superior will; as the universe is that which he has made, and which belongs to him, every consideration would lead him to do right to all. He can have no partiality for one more than another; and there can be no one to whom he would desire to do injustice - for who wishes to injure that which belongs to himself? Prof. Lee, however, renders this, "Who hath set a land in order against him?" He supposes that the remark is designed to show the folly of rebelling against God. But the former interpretation seems better to accord with the scope of the argument.<p>Or who hath disposed the whole world? - Who has arranged the affairs of the universe? The word rendered "world," usually means the habitable earth, but it is employed here in the sense of the universe, and the idea is, that God has arranged and ordered all things, and that he is the supreme and absolute Sovereign. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. If the world were not God's property, as having been made by Him, but committed to His charge by some superior, it might be possible for Him to act unjustly, as He would not thereby be injuring Himself; but as it is, for God to act unjustly would undermine the whole order of the world, and so would injure God's own property (Job 36:23).<p>disposed&#8212;hath founded (Isa 44:7), established the circle of the globe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Over the earth, </span> i.e. over the inhabitants of the earth, to rule them according to his laws, and to give an account to him of it. Who or where is his superior that made the world, and then delivered the government of it to God? There is no such person. God himself is the sole Creator, the absolute and supreme Lord and Governor, of all the world, and therefore cannot do unjustly. The reason is, partly, because all unrighteousness is a transgression of some law, and God hath no law to bound him but his own nature and will; partly, because the Creator and Lord of the world must needs have all possible perfections in himself, and, amongst others, perfect justice, and must needs be free from all imperfections and obliquities, and therefore from injustice; and partly, because he is of himself all-sufficient, and independent upon all other persons, and able to do and procure whatsoever pleaseth him; and therefore as he hath no inclination, so he hath no temptation, to any unrighteous actions; this being generally the reason of all unrighteous actions in the world, because the persons who do them either are obliged to do it, to gratify some superior authority who commands them to do it, or else do want or desire something which they cannot justly obtain; for he is a monster, and not a man, who will take away any thing by injustice or violence which he may have by right. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who hath disposed, </span> or <span class="ital">committed</span>, to wit, to him, to be governed by him, in the name and for the use and service of his superior Lord, to whom he must give an account. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who hath given him a charge over the earth?.... Or who hath committed the earth unto him, and made it his care and charge? Is there any above him that has put him into this post and office? Under whose direction and command is he, and to whom is he accountable? None at all; he is no deputy or sub-governor: the kings of the earth are under him, and they have others subordinate to them; but he above all, higher than the highest: he is sole Governor of the world in his own right, by right of creation, and which he has from himself and not another; he has no rival, nor partner with him, none to whom he is accountable, or can control him; and since he is the Judge of all the earth, he will do right. Subordinate governors sometimes do unjust things in obedience to their superiors, or to please them, or through fear of them; but nothing of this kind is or can be the case with God; as he cannot do any injustice through inclination of nature, nor through ignorance, as men may; so neither through fear of any, there being none above him from whom he has received a charge, or that rules over him; and, as Jarchi expresses it, can say to him, what dost thou? as, I did not command thee so and so. And though he is sovereign and independent, and his power uncontrollable, it is contrary to his nature to make an ill use of it; and was justice perverted by him, the world would soon be in the utmost confusion: but it is a plain case there is a God that judgeth in the earth, and cannot commit iniquity. Or this may be said with respect to man; who has committed the earth to man, to be his charge, to be governed by him? if so, it would soon come to nothing; all creatures in it would be destroyed, as in the following verses; but this is not the case. Or who has given it to man to possess it, and to enjoy all things in it, and has put all things into his hands, and in subjection to him, to make use thereof, and for his good, delight, and pleasure, and visits him in it in a providential way, in great kindness and goodness? It is the Lord; and can it be thought that he that is so good and beneficent to men will do them any injustice? no, surely! Yea, should he take away all these good things he has given them, and even life itself, it could be no injustice, since he would only take away what he had given and had a right unto; <p>or who hath disposed the whole world? or created it, as Aben Ezra; that stored it with all the good things in it for the use of men? or put it in the beautiful order it is, so suitable and convenient for the good of his creatures? or made it the habitable earth it is for man and beast? so Mr. Broughton renders the whole, <p>"who before him looked to the earth, or who settled all the dwelt land?'' <p>Or who made it the fruitful earth it is, abounding with plenty of food for man and beast? or who disposes of all things in it by his wise providence, so that everything is beautiful in its season? None but the Lord has done all this; how then can it be thought that he who has filled the earth with his goodness should do wickedly or pervert judgment? <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13–15</span>. The first thought of Elihu is that the earth, the world, is not entrusted to God by another; He himself arranged it all as it is; there is therefore no motive to injustice. This is one side of his idea; the other (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm" title="If he set his heart on man, if he gather to himself his spirit and his breath;">Job 34:14</a></span>) is that the fact of the creation and sustaining of all things and creatures by God is proof of unselfish benevolence, for if God thought of Himself and ceased to send forth His spirit, all flesh would perish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Oriental thinker was not a pessimist; to his mind life was not an evil but the highest good, and its continuance proof of goodness in God who gave it and continued it. Neither would it occur to such a thinker, when he argued that there was no temptation to injustice in the Creator, that a temptation might be found in His own malevolent nature. A first cause that was evil could not be supposed by any one in the position of the speakers in this Book. Even when Job touches upon such an idea, as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm" title="What is man, that you should magnify him? and that you should set your heart on him?">Job 7:17</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm" title="Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and shine on the counsel of the wicked?">Job 10:3</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., it is for the purpose of shewing the inconsistency of malevolence with God’s necessary attributes.

Another utterance of Job closely connected with it has so roused Elihu's indignation, that he prefaces it with the exclamation of astonishment: Who is a man like Job, i.e., where in all the world (&#1502;&#1497; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-23.htm">2 Samuel 7:23</a>) has this Job his equal, who ... . The attributive clause refers to Job; "to drink scorn (here: blasphemy) like water," is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>, equivalent to to give one's self up to mockery with delight, and to find satisfaction in it. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; &#1500;&#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;, to go over to any one's side, looks like a poeticized prose expression. &#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; is a continuation of the &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;, according to Ew. 351, c, but not directly in the sense "and he goes," but, as in the similar examples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-17.htm">2 Chronicles 7:17</a>, and freq., in the sense of: "he is in the act of going;" comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-20.htm">Job 36:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a>. The utterance runs: a man does not profit, viz., himself (on the use of &#1505;&#1499;&#1503; of persons as well as of things, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>), by his having joyous and familiar intercourse (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1514;&#1493;, as little equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a>) with God. Job has nowhere expressly said this, but certainly the declaration in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>, in connection with the repeated complaints concerning the anomalous distribution of human destinies (vid., especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-1.htm">Job 24:1</a>), are the premises for such a conclusion. That Elihu, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>, is more harsh against Job than the friends ever were (comp. e.g., the well-measured reproach of Eliphaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-4.htm">Job 15:4</a>), and that he puts words into Job's moth which occur nowhere verbatim in his speeches, is worked up by the Latin fathers (Jer., Philippus Presbyter, Beda,<p>(Note: Philippus Presbyter was a disciple of Jerome. His Comm. in Iobum is extant in many forms, partly epitomized, partly interpolated (on this subject, vid., Hieronymi Opp. ed. Vallarsi, iii. 895ff.).
