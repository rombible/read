Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For his eyes are upon the ways of man - None can escape from his notice; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2-3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. God's omniscience and omnipotence enable Him to execute immediate justice. He needs not to be long on the "watch," as Job thought (Job 7:12; 2Ch 16:9; Jer 32:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is added as the reason of the judgments mentioned in the foregoing verse, God doth not afflict nor destroy either princes or people unjustly, no, nor out of his mere pleasure and absolute sovereignty, (to which Job seemed to impute his calamities,) but for their sins, which God sees exactly, although they use all possible arts and tricks to hide them from him. Therefore no man hath cause to complain of God, but of himself, for all that he may suffer in the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For his eyes are upon the ways of man,.... Which denotes the omniscience of God, which reaches to every man, to every individual, and to all men in general; and to their ways, to every step taken by them, to the whole of their lives and conversations, and every action of them; to all their internal and external ways and goings; perhaps the former may be meant in this, and the latter in the following clause. This may denote all their inward thoughts, the workings of their mind, the imaginations of their heart; all their secret purposes, designs, and schemes; and all the desires and affections of their soul; and all these, whether good or bad: <p>and he seeth all his goings; the whole of his walk and conversation, conduct and behaviour; all his external ways, works, and actions; and these whether of good or bad men, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21–24</span>.

The omniscience of God is a security against his acting  unjustly. He knows exactly each man's powers, capacities, temperament, temptations, circumstances He can exactly me, sure each man's due, and will assuredly mete it out to each without partiality or prejudice. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  Yea verily God acteth not wickedly,<p>And the Almighty perverteth not the right.<p>13  Who hath given the earth in charge to Him?<p>And who hath disposed the whole globe?<p>14  If He only set His heart upon Himself,<p>If He took back His breath and His inspiration to Himself:<p>15  All flesh would expire together,<p>And man would return to dust.<p>With &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501; (Yea verily, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-4.htm">Job 19:4</a>, "and really") the counter-assertion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-11.htm">Job 34:11</a> is repeated, but negatively expressed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>). &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; signifies sometimes to act as &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, and at others to be set forth and condemned as a &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;; here, as the connection requires, it is the former. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a> begins the proof. Ewald's interpretation: who searcheth, and Hahn's: who careth for the earth beside Him, are hazardous and unnecessary. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; with &#1506;&#1500; of the person and the acc. of the thing signifies: to enjoin anything as a duty on any one, to entrust anything to any one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-23.htm">Job 36:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-27.htm">Numbers 4:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>; therefore: who has made the earth, i.e., the care of it, a duty to Him? &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; (Milel) is not to be refined into the meaning "to the earth" (as here by Schultens and a few others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> by Luzzatto: he hath smitten down, better: dishonoured, to the earth with a light stroke), but is poetically equivalent to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, as &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; (comp. modern Greek &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;) is in prose equivalent to &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a> is by no means, with Ew. and Hahn, to be translated: who observes (considers) the whole globe, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-23.htm">Job 34:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> - the expression would be too contracted to affirm that no one but God bestowed providential attention upon the earth; and if we have understood <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a> correctly, the thought is also inappropriate. A more appropriate thought is gained, if &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is supplied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a>: who has enjoined upon Him the whole circle of the earth (Saad., Gecat., Hirz., Schlottm.); but this continued force of the &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; into the second independent question is improbable in connection with the repetition of &#1502;&#1497;. Therefore: who has appointed, i.e., established (&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-5.htm">Job 38:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7</a>), - a still somewhat more suitable thought, going logically further, since the one giving the charge ought to be the lord of him who receives the commission, and therefore the Creator of the world. This is just God alone, by whose &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; and &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492; the animal world as well as the world of men (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>) has its life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a> : if He should direct His heart, i.e., His attention (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>), to Himself (emphatic: Himself alone), draw in (&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; comp. for the matter <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>, Psychol. S. 406) to Himself His inspiration and breath (which emanated from Him or was effected by Him), all flesh would sink together, i.e., die off at once (this, as it appears, has reference to the taking back of the animal life, &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;), and man would return (this has reference to the taking back of the human spirit, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;) to dust (&#1506;&#1500; instead of &#1488;&#1500;, perhaps with reference to the usual use of the &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-11.htm">Job 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-26.htm">Job 21:26</a>).<p>Only a few modern expositors refer &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, as Targ. Jer. and Syr., to man instead of reflexively to God; the majority rightly decide in favour of the idea which even Grotius perceived: si sibi ipsi tantum bonus esse (sui unius curam habere) vellet. &#1488;&#1501; followed by the fut. signifies either si velit (lxx &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;), as here, or as more frequently, si vellet, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2-4</a>. It is worthy of remark that, according to Norzi's statement, the Babylonian texts presented &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>, as Chethb, &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; as Ker (like our Palestine text, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-18.htm">Daniel 11:18</a>), which a MS of De Rossi, with a Persian translation, confirms; the reading gives a fine idea: that God's heart is turned towards the world, and is unclosed; its ethical condition of life would then be like its physical ground of life, that God's spirit dwells in it; the drawing back of the heart, and the taking back to Himself of the spirit, would be equivalent to the exclusion of the world from God's love and life. However, &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; implies the same; for a reference of God's thinking and willing to Himself, with the exclusion of the world, would be just a removal of His love. Elihu's proof is this: God does not act wrongly, for the government of the world is not a duty imposed upon Him from without, but a relation entered into freely by Him: the world is not the property of another, but of His free creative appointment; and how unselfishly, how devoid of self-seeking He governs it, is clear from the fact, that by the impartation of His living creative breath He sustains every living thing, and does not, as He easily might, allow them to fall away into nothingness. There is therefore a divine love which has called the world into being and keeps it in being; and this love, as the perfect opposite of sovereign caprice, is a pledge for the absolute righteousness of the divine rule. </body></html>
