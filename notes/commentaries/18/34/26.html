Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He striketh them as wicked men - literally, "Under the wicked, or on account of the wicked, he smites them." That is, he deals with them "as if" they were wicked; he regards and treats them as such. He deals with them "under" the general character of wicked people, and punishes them accordingly.<p>In the open sight of others - Margin, as in Hebrew "in the place of beholders." The idea is, that it is done openly or publicly. Their sins had been committed in secret, but they are punished openly. The manifestation of the divine displeasure is in the presence of spectators, or is so open and public, that it cannot but be seen. It is very probable that in all this description Elihu had his eye upon the public calamities which had come upon Job, and that he meant to include him among the number of mighty men whom God thus suddenly overturned. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

Such is the strict justice of God, that he never strikes men, or inflicts punishment on them, or brings down his judgments upon them, but as wicked men, and because of their wickedness; the casting of man out of Eden was for his sin, as well as the casting down the angels from heaven that sinned; the drowning of the old world, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the ruin of Pharaoh and his host, the driving the Canaanites out of their land, the various captivities of the Israelites, with other instances of God's displeasure with men in this world, and the everlasting punishment of them in another, are only of them as wicked men, and for sin; and therefore he is not chargeable with any unrighteousness. Sephorno interprets it, "instead of wicked men", and illustrates it by the shaking out of Pharaoh and his host into the sea in the room and stead of the wicked Israelites, that came up from thence, <p>in the open sight of others: which the same interpreter refers to the Israelites seeing the Egyptians dead on the seashore; or "in the place of them that see" (f), that is, in a public manner, as generally malefactors are executed, to which the allusion may be; it denotes the publicness of God's righteous judgments on wicked men, for the greater declaration of his power and justice, and for the greater shame and disgrace of such wicked men, and for the joy and comfort of the righteous delivered from them. <p>(f)  "in loco videntium", V.

Thou evil-doer! to princes?" The reading &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is an unnecessary lightening of the difficulty. It were a crimen laesae, if one reproached a king with being unjust, and therefore thereby denied him the most essential requisite of a ruler; and now even Him (Merc. correctly supplies tanto minus ei) who does not give the preference to the person (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-8.htm">Job 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-21.htm">Job 32:21</a>) of princes, and does not (with preference) regard (on &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-29.htm">Job 21:29</a>, also here Piel, and according to the statement of the Masora, Milel, for an acknowledged reason which can be maintained even in remarkable instances, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a> in &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a> in &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;, whereas <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-7.htm">1 Samuel 23:7</a> is Milra) the rich before (&#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; in the sense of prae) the poor! therefore the King of kings, who makes no partial distinction, because the king and the beggar are the work of His hands: they stand equally near to Him as being His creatures, and He is exalted above both alike as their Creator, this order and partiality are excluded; - what a nota bene against the doctrine of the decretum absolutum, which makes the love of the Creator a partial love, and turns this love, which in its very nature is perfect love, into caprice! In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> Elihu appeals to human history in favour of this impartiality of the Ruler of the world. It may there appear as though God with partiality suffered rulers and peoples in authority in the world to do as they please; but suddenly they die away, and in fact in the middle of the night (here Mercha-mahpach), the individuals of a great people (thus must &#1506;&#1501; be understood in accordance with the prominently-placed plur. predicate, Ges. 146, 1) tremble and perish; and they remove (&#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; instead of the passive, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a> and frequently) the mighty - &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;. It is not the hand of man which does this, but an invisible higher power (which, if it is called yd, only bears this name per anthropomorphismum); comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>, &#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1505; &#1497;&#1491;; and also <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>, like the New Testament use of &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The subj. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> are the previously mentioned princes. The division according to the accents may be received with hesitation, since the symmetry of the sticks, which it restores, is not unfrequently wanting in the Elihu section. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> refers back to the possessors of power, and in the interval, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> describes the fate of those who belong to the people which has become subservient to their lust of conquest, for &#1506;&#1501; cannot signify "in crowds" (Ew., Hahn); it is therefore, and especially when mentioned as here between princes and rulers, the people, and in fact, in distinction from gwy, the people together forming a state. </body></html>
