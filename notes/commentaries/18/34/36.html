Job's friends would have had him own himself a wicked man. Let will only oblige him to own that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. Let us, in giving reproof, not make a matter worse than it is. Elihu directs Job to humble himself before God for his sins, and to accept the punishment. Also to pray to God to discover his sins to him. A good man is willing to know the worst of himself; particularly, under affliction, he desires to be told wherefore God contends with him. It is not enough to be sorry for our sins, but we must go and sin no more. And if we are affectionate children, we shall love to speak with our Father, and to tell him all our mind. Elihu reasons with Job concerning his discontent under affliction. We are ready to think every thing that concerns us should be just as we would have it; but it is not reasonable to expect this. Elihu asks whether there was not sin and folly in what Job said. God is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works, Ps 145:17. The believer saith, Let my Saviour, my wise and loving Lord, choose every thing for me. I am sure that will be wisest, and the best for his glory and my good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My desire is - Margin, "or, "my father, let Job be tried."" This variation between the text and the margin, arises from the different interpretations affixed to the Hebrew word &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;  'a&#770;biy. The Hebrew word commonly means "father," and some have supposed that that sense is to be retained here, and then it would be a solemn appeal to God as his Father - expressing the earnest prayer of Elihu that Job might be fully tried. But the difficulties in this interpretation are obvious:<p>(1) Such a mode of appeal to God occurs nowhere else in the book, and it is little in the spirit of the poem. No particular reason can be assigned why that solemn appeal should be made here, rather than in many other places.<p>(2) The name "Father," though often given to God in the Scriptures, is not elsewhere given to him in this book.<p>The probability is, therefore, that the word is from &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;  'a&#770;ba&#770;h - "to breathe after, to desire," and means that Elihu "desired" that Job should have a fair trial. No other similar form of the word, however, occurs The Vulgate renders it, "Pater mi, my father;" the Septuagint, "But learn, Job, no more to make reply like the foolish;" the Chaldee, &#1510;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; - "I desire."<p>May be tried - That his views may be fully canvassed and examined. He had expressed sentiments which Elihu thought should not be allowed to pass without the most careful examination into their truth and bearing. "Unto the end." In the most full and free manner; that the matter should be pursued as far as possible, so that it might be wholly understood. Literally, it means "forever" - &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;  &#8219;ad-netsach.<p>Because of his answers for wicked men - Because of the views which he has expressed, which seem to favor the wicked. Elihu refers to the opinions advanced by Job that God did not punish people in this life, or did not deal with them according to their characters, which "he" interpreted as giving countenance to wickedness, or as affirming the God was not the enemy of impiety. The Vulgate renders this, "My Father, let Job be tried to the end; do not cease from the man of iniquity;" but the true meaning doubtless is, that Job had uttered sentiments which Elihu understood to favor the wicked, and he was desirous that every trial should be applied to him which would tend to correct his erroneous views. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36.

This is my opinion, or what "I bring in" (o) adduce, and lay before you, men of understanding and wisdom, and leave it with you to consider of. Some render it, "O my Father, let Job be tried", &amp;c. as if it was an apostrophe to God, and a request to him; so Mr. Broughton, who adds, <p>"which art in heaven,'' <p>and the same is added by some Jewish interpreters (p), as there are others (q) of them which go this way, and also several Christian commentators (r); and of late (s) it has been urged, from this and other passages, that Elihu was Christ, who here addresses God as his father: but this is his New Testament title; and though God is the father of all men by creation, and of saints by adoption, yet this relation and title are not so frequently claimed under the former dispensation, or however not so early as the times of Job, but are more peculiar to the Gospel dispensation, under which saints receive "not the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of adoption, whereby they cry, Abba, Father", <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; wherefore admitting this version, rather some grave venerable person, as Eliphaz (t), senior to Elihu, who was a young man, is addressed under this title; or the whole circle of Job's friends now about him, all elder than Elihu, may be intended; "father" for "fathers", the singular for the plural, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>; and what he proposes is, that they should make it their joint request at the throne of grace, that Job's afflictions be still continued; that he might be thoroughly tried by them, and be purged from all his dross, he not appearing yet to be thoroughly sensible of his sinful speeches, and humbled for them; and therefore it was proper he should be still corrected and chastened to the end, or unto victory, as Mr. Broughton, or until victory was obtained, and he was obliged to yield, and cry "peccavi": but since afflictions are things not joyous but grievous, and it does not seem so agreeable to a good man, kind and humane, to desire the continuance of the afflictions of another, though palliated with a plausible for his good; it seems better to understand this as a motion made to the understanding part of the company by Elihu, that the words of Job, which he had spoken without knowledge and wisdom, might be taken under strict examination by them, and thoroughly scanned, that it might be better known what was proper to be said more to him for his conviction; <p>because of his answers for wicked men; or concerning or relative to such answers which he had made, which were like to those which wicked men make; who charge the ways of God with inequality and want of equity, ask where is the God of judgment? or which serve the cause of the wicked, and which furnish them with arguments, prepare them for them, and put them into their mouths, to argue against God and his providential dealings with men, and against all religion. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-8.htm">Job 34:8</a>. <p>(o) "pro" "adducam", so some in Codurcus: "haec autem in medio affero", Tigurine version; "adduco", Schultens. (p) P.

The sentiment is excessively harsh, and probably Elihu, though of course concurring in it, puts it forth indirectly as the judgment of others. The wish is expressed that Job might be <span class="ital">tried unto the end</span>, constantly—that his afflictions might be continued till he should give over answering in the manner of wicked men. His “answers” are his speeches in reply to the three friends, which are characterized as such as only ungodly men would utter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Would that Job were tested to the uttermost</span>! <span class="accented">-</span> "tested'" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as gold is tested, by the touchstone, and "to the uttermost," so that there should be no doubt as to the result.

The conjecture &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;<p>(Note: Vid., Grtz in Frankel's Monatsschrift, 1861, i.)<p>is not required either here or <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> (where &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; signifies to punish the guilty); &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is also not to be translated turbabit (Rosenm.), since &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (Arab. rs&#8219;, rsg) according to its primitive notion does not signify "to be restless, to rage," but "to be relaxed, hollow" (opposite of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, Arab. s&#803;dq, to be hard, firm, tight). Further: If God hides His countenance, i.e., is angry and punishes, who can then behold Him, i.e., make Him, the veiled One, visible and claim back the favour withdrawn? The Waw of &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;, if one marks off the periods of the paratactic expression, is in both cases the Waw of conclusion after hypothetical antecedents, and. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-29.htm">Job 34:29</a> refers to Job's impetuous challenging of God. Thus exalted above human controversy and defiance, God rules both over the mass and over individuals alike. &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; gives intensity of the equality thus correlatively (et-et) expressed (Targ., Syr.); to refer it to &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; as generalizing (lxx, Jer. et super omnes homines), is forbidden by the antithesis of peoples and individuals. To the thought, that God giveth rest (from oppressors) and hides His countenance (from the oppressors and in general those who act wrongly), two co-ordinate negative final clauses are attached: in order that godless men may not rule (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>, Keri), in order that they may no longer be (&#1502;( e  equals  &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, under the influence of the notion of putting aside contained in the preceding final clause, therefore like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a> &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a> &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;, and the like) snares of the people, i.e., those whose evil example and bad government become the ruin of the community.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-31.htm">Job 34:31</a> the view of those who by some jugglery concerning the laws of the vowel sounds explain &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as imper. Niph. ( equals  &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;), be it in the sense of &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, dicendum est (Rosenm., Schlottm., and others, after Raschi), or even in the unheard-of reflexive signification: express thyself (Stick., Hahn), is to be rejected. The syncopated form of the infin. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1490;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>, does not serve as a palliation of this adventurous imperative. It is, on the contrary, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; with &#1492; interrog., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-9.htm">Ezekiel 28:9</a> &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, and probably also &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-7.htm">Micah 2:7</a> (vid., Hitz.). A direct exhortation to Job to penitence would also not be in place here, although what Elihu says is levelled against Job. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is confirmatory. Thus God acts with that class of unscrupulous men who abuse their power for the destruction of their subjects: for he (one of them) says (or: has said, from the standpoint of the execution of punishment) to God, etc. Ew. differently: "for one says thus to God even: I expiate what I do not commit," by understanding the speech quoted of a defiance which reproachfully demands an explanation. It is, however, manifestly a compendious model confession. And since Elihu with &#1499;&#1497; establishes the execution of punishment from this, that it never entered the mind of the &#1506;&#1491;&#1501; &#1495;&#1504;&#1507; thus to humble himself before God, so &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; here cannot signify: I have repented (put up with and had to bear what I have deserved); on the contrary, the confession begins with the avowal: I have exalted myself (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, se efferre, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>), which is then followed by the vow: I will not (in the future) do evil (&#1495;&#1489;&#1500; synon. &#1506;&#1493;&#1492;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-7.htm">Nehemiah 1:7</a>, and probably also supra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>), and the entreaty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-32.htm">Job 34:32</a> : beside that which I behold (elliptical object-clause, Ew. 333, b), i.e., what lies beyond my vision ( equals  &#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>, unacknowledged sins), teach me; and the present vow has reference to acknowledged sins and sins that have still to be acknowledged: if I have done wrong, I will do it no more. Thus speaking - Elihu means - those high ones might have anticipated the punishment of the All-just God, for favour instead of wrath cannot be extorted, it is only reached by the way of lowly penitence. </body></html>
