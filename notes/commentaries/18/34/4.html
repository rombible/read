The plainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart is sanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures, can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion, better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spoken as if he meant wholly to justify himself. He that say, I have cleansed my hands in vain, does not only offend against God's children, Ps 73:13-15, but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let us choose to us judgment - That is, let us examine and explore what is true and right.

Niph., syncopated from &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, Ew. 244, b) in the light of life (as it were bask in the new and restored light of life) - it does not always happen, for these are experiences of no ordinary kind, which interrupt the daily course of life; and it is not even repeated again and again constantly, for if it is without effect the first time, it is repeated a second or third time, but it has an end if the man trifles constantly with the disciplinary work of grace which designs his good. Finally, Elihu calls upon Job quietly to ponder this, that he may proceed; nevertheless, if he has words, i.e., if he thinks he is able to advance any appropriate objections, he is continually to answer him (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with acc. of the person, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>), for he (Elihu) would willingly justify him, i.e., he would gladly be in the position to be able to acknowledge Job to be right, and to have the accusation dispensed with. Hirz. and others render falsely: I wish thy justification, i.e., thou shouldst justify thyself; in this case &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; ought to be supplied, which is unnecessary: &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, without a change of subject, has the inf. constr. here without &#1500;, as it has the inf. absol. in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1511; signifies to vindicate (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>), or acknowledge to be in the right (as the Piel of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-12.htm">Job 33:12</a>), both of which are blended here. The lxx, which translates &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;, has probably read &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-27.htm">Psalm 35:27</a>). If it is not so (&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>), viz., that he does not intend to defend himself with reference to his expostulation with God on account of the affliction decreed for him, he shall on his part (&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;) listen, shall be silent and be further taught wisdom.<p>Quasi hac ratione Heliu sanctum Iob convicerit! exclaims Beda, after a complete exposition of this speech. He regards Elihu as the type of the false wisdom of the heathen, which fails to recognise and persecutes the servant of God: Sunt alii extra ecclesiam, qui Christo ejusque ecclesiae similiter adversantur, quorum imaginem praetulit Balaam ille ariolus, qui et Elieu sicut patrum traditio habet (Balaam and Elihu, one person - a worthless conceit repeated in the Talmud and Midrash), qui contra ipsum sanctum Iob multa improbe et injuriose locutus est, in tantum ut etiam displiceret in una ejus et indisciplinata loquacitas.<p>(Note: Bedae Opp. ed. Basil. iii. col. 602f. 786. The commentary also bears the false name of Jerome Hieronymus, and as a writing attributed to him is contained in tom. v. Opp. ed. Vallarsi.)<p>Gregory the Great, in his Moralia, expresses himself no less unfavourably at the conclusion of this speech: <p>continued...</body></html>
