The plainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart is sanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures, can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion, better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spoken as if he meant wholly to justify himself. He that say, I have cleansed my hands in vain, does not only offend against God's children, Ps 73:13-15, but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear my words, O ye wise men - Addressing particularly the three friends of Job. The previous chapter had been addressed to Job himself. He had stated to him his views of the design of affliction, and he had nothing to reply. He now addresses himself to his friends, with a particular view of examining some of the sentiments which Job had advanced, and of showing where he was in error. He addresses them as "wise men," or sages, and as endowed with "knowledge," to conciliate their attention, and because he regarded them as qualified to understand the difficult subject which he proposed to explain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This is not an address to Job's three friends, as some think; for Elihu had expressed his displeasure at them, in condemning Job without convicting him, and returning solid answers to him; and therefore he should not take their method of dealing with him, but take another; and plainly suggests that wisdom was not with them, nor taught by them; and therefore, as he could not give flattering titles to men, it could not well be thought that he should address them as wise and understanding men, unless indeed in an ironic way, as some choose to interpret it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-3.htm">Job 32:3</a>. Rather therefore some bystanders are here spoken to, whom Elihu knew to be men of wisdom and knowledge, &amp;c. as it follows, <p>and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge; and as they were endued not only with natural and political wisdom and knowledge, but with that which is divine and spiritual, they were proper judges of the affair in controversy, and could best discern whether what Elihu delivered was right or wrong, and to the purpose or not. And besides, though they had a large share of wisdom and knowledge, yet it was but imperfect; and the most wise and knowing may become more so, and that sometimes by means of their inferiors and juniors: and therefore Elihu craves their attention to what he had said or should say, though he was but a young man, and they aged, and men of great geniuses and abilities; and the rather he might be pressing on them to be his hearers and judges, because, generally speaking, such, as they are the most judicious, so the most candid hearers. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hear my words, O ye <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> wise <i>men</i>; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</span><p>(a) Which are esteemed wise by the world.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">The wise</span> men are not the three friends, but the bystanders who hear Elihu; cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-34.htm" title="Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man listen to me.">Job 34:34</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2–4</span>. Elihu invites the wise among those who listen to him to attend to what he further says, and to unite with him in seeking to discover the right in this cause between Job and God.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>29  Behold, God doeth all<p>Twice, thrice with man,<p>30  To bring back his soul from the pit,<p>That it may become light in the light of life.<p>31  Listen, O Job, hearken to me;<p>Be silent and let me speak on.<p>32  Yet if thou hast words, answer me;<p>Speak, for I desire thy justification.<p>33  If not, hearken thou to me;<p>Be silent and I will teach thee wisdom.<p>After having described two prominent modes of divine interposition for the moral restoration and welfare of man, he adds, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>, that God undertakes (observe the want of parallelism in the distich, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>) everything with a man twice or thrice (asyndeton, as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>, in the sense of bis terve) in order to bring back his soul from the pit (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, here for the fifth time in this speech, without being anywhere interchanged with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; or another synonym, which is remarkable), that it, having hitherto been encompassed by the darkness of death, may be, or become, light (&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, inf. Niph., syncopated from &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, Ew. 244, b) in the light of life (as it were bask in the new and restored light of life) - it does not always happen, for these are experiences of no ordinary kind, which interrupt the daily course of life; and it is not even repeated again and again constantly, for if it is without effect the first time, it is repeated a second or third time, but it has an end if the man trifles constantly with the disciplinary work of grace which designs his good. Finally, Elihu calls upon Job quietly to ponder this, that he may proceed; nevertheless, if he has words, i.e., if he thinks he is able to advance any appropriate objections, he is continually to answer him (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with acc. of the person, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>), for he (Elihu) would willingly justify him, i.e., he would gladly be in the position to be able to acknowledge Job to be right, and to have the accusation dispensed with. Hirz. and others render falsely: I wish thy justification, i.e., thou shouldst justify thyself; in this case &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; ought to be supplied, which is unnecessary: &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, without a change of subject, has the inf. constr. here without &#1500;, as it has the inf. absol. in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1511; signifies to vindicate (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>), or acknowledge to be in the right (as the Piel of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-12.htm">Job 33:12</a>), both of which are blended here. The lxx, which translates &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;, has probably read &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-27.htm">Psalm 35:27</a>).

He regards Elihu as the type of the false wisdom of the heathen, which fails to recognise and persecutes the servant of God: Sunt alii extra ecclesiam, qui Christo ejusque ecclesiae similiter adversantur, quorum imaginem praetulit Balaam ille ariolus, qui et Elieu sicut patrum traditio habet (Balaam and Elihu, one person - a worthless conceit repeated in the Talmud and Midrash), qui contra ipsum sanctum Iob multa improbe et injuriose locutus est, in tantum ut etiam displiceret in una ejus et indisciplinata loquacitas.<p>(Note: Bedae Opp. ed. Basil. iii. col. 602f. 786. The commentary also bears the false name of Jerome Hieronymus, and as a writing attributed to him is contained in tom. v. Opp. ed. Vallarsi.)<p>Gregory the Great, in his Moralia, expresses himself no less unfavourably at the conclusion of this speech: <p>continued...</body></html>
