This is an incidental indication that we are scarcely intended to understand the long-continued argument as the record of an actual discussion. Elihu begins to take broader ground than the friends of Job, inasmuch as he concerns himself, not with the problems of God’s government, but with the impossibility of His acting unjustly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>), and the reason he gives is somewhat strange—it is the fact that God is irresponsible, He has not been put in charge over the earth; but His authority is ultimate and original, and being so, He can have no personal interests to secure at all risks; He can only have in view the ultimate good of all His creatures, for, on the other hand, if He really desired to slay them, their breath is in His hands, and He would only have to recall it. The earth and all that is in it belongs to God: it is His own, and not another’s entrusted to Him; His self-interest, therefore, cannot come into collision with the welfare of His creatures, because their welfare is the welfare of that which is His—of that, therefore, in which He Himself has the largest interest. The argument is a somewhat strange one to us, but it is sound at bottom, for it recognises God as the prime origin and final hope of all His creatures, and assumes that His will can only be good, and that it must be the best because it is His. (Comp. St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-12.htm" title="But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.">John 10:12-13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/34.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-10.htm" title="Therefore listen to me you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity....">Job 34:10-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Hearken to me, ye men of understanding — </span>Ye who are present, and understand these things, do you judge between Job and me. <span class="ital">Far be it from God that he should do wickedness — </span>This I must lay down as a principle, that the righteous and holy God neither does nor can deal unjustly with Job, or with any man, as Job insinuates that God hath dealt with him. <span class="ital">For the work of a man — </span>That is, the reward of his work; <span class="ital">shall he render unto him, </span>&c. — Job’s afflictions, though great and distressing, are not undeserved, but justly inflicted upon him, both for the original corruption of his nature, and for many actual transgressions, which are known to God, though Job, through partiality, may not see them. And Job’s piety shall be recompensed, it may be, in this life, but undoubtedly in the next; and therefore piety is not unprofitable, as Job signifies. <span class="ital">Neither will the Almighty pervert judgment </span>— As Job hath erroneously affirmed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:10-15 Elihu had showed Job, that God meant him no hurt by afflicting him, but intended his spiritual benefit. Here he shows, that God did him no wrong by afflicting him. If the former did not satisfy him, this ought to silence him. God cannot do wickedness, nor the Almighty commit wrong. If services now go unrewarded, and sins now go unpunished, yet there is a day coming, when God will fully render to every man according to his works. Further, though the believer's final condemnation is done away through the Saviour's ransom, yet he has merited worse than any outward afflictions; so that no wrong is done to him, however he may be tried.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore hearken unto me - Elihu proceeds now to reply to what he regarded as the erroneous sentiments of Job, and to show the impropriety of language which reflected so much on God and his government. Instead, however, of meeting the facts in the case, and showing how the actual course of events could be reconciled with justice, he resolves it all into a matter of sovereignty, and maintains that it is wrong to doubt the rectitude of the dealings of one so mighty as God. In this he pursues the same course substantially which the friends of Job had done, and does little more to solve the real difficulties in the case than they had. The facts to which Job had referred are scarcely adverted to; the perplexing questions are still unsolved, and the amount of all that Elihu says is, that God is a sovereign, and that there must be an improper spirit when people presume to pronounce on his dealings.<p>Ye men of understanding - Margin, as in Hebrew men of "heart." The word heart is used here as it was uniformly among the Hebrews; the Jewish view of physiology being that the heart was the seat of all the mental operations. They never speak of the head as the seat of the intellect, as we do. The meaning here is, that Elihu regarded them as sages, qualified to comprehend and appreciate the truth on the subject under discussion.<p>Far be it from God - Hebrew &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;  cha&#770;l&#305;&#770;yla&#770;h - "profane, unholy." It is an expression of abhorrence, as if the thing proposed were profane or unholy: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-2.htm">1 Samuel 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-16.htm">Joshua 24:16</a>. The meaning here is, that the very idea that God would do wrong, or could patronize iniquity, was a profane conception, and was not to be tolerated for a moment. This is true enough, and in this general sentiment, no doubt, Job would himself have concurred. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. The true answer to Job, which God follows up (Job 38:1-41). Man is to believe God's ways are right, because they are His, not because we fully see they are so (Ro 9:14; De 32:4; Ge 18:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye men of understanding; </span> you who are present, and understand these things, do you judge between Job and me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Far be it from God that he should do wickedness:</span> this I must lay down as a principle, that the righteous and holy God neither doth nor can deal unjustly with Job, or with any man, as Job insinuates that God had dealt with him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding,.... The same persons he addresses as wise men and men of knowledge, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-2.htm">Job 34:2</a>; and here as men of understanding, or "heart" (z); the heart being the seat of wisdom and knowledge; and such Elihu desired to be his hearers, to attend to what he was about to say; which was to refute the words of Job, or his sense expressed in the preceding verses; <p>far be it from God that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity; do any injustice or injury to any person, there being no unrighteousness in him, nor in any of his ways and works; which Job tacitly seemed to charge God with, at least as Elihu understood him. But sin is contrary to his pure and holy nature; he cannot look upon it with pleasure, much less commit it; it is forbidden by his holy righteous law, and therefore would never he done by him the lawgiver; nor can anyone single instance be given of wickedness and unrighteousness committed by him in any of his works of nature, or providence, or grace. He is the author of the evil of afflictions, whether as punishments or fatherly corrections; and in neither case does he commit or do any injustice; not in punishing wicked men less than they deserve, as he does in this life; nor in correcting his own people, which is always for their good: but not of the evil of sin; this may be concluded from the titles here given, of "Almighty and All-sufficient"; for being so he can be under no temptation of doing an unjust thing; and which is expressed with the like abhorrence and indignation by Elihu as the same sentiment is by the Apostle Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-14.htm">Romans 9:14</a>. <p>(z)  "viri cordis", Pagninus, Montanus, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10–12</span>. Elihu’s argument in these verses is the truest answer that can be given: injustice on the part of God is inconsistent with the idea of God. The three friends had urged the same plea. And Job would have accepted the argument had his friends or himself been able to take it up as a general principle and keep it clear from complications with the events of actual providence. When, however, they combined it with their other theory that good and evil befell men solely according to the principle of retribution, and that this latter principle was that according to which God’s actual providence was entirely administered, Job could not consent to their reasoning. And as he agreed with them that retributive righteousness was or ought to be the principle of God’s rule of the world, he was obliged, as he entirely failed to perceive such a principle adhered to, to charge God with injustice. It is not easy to see how Elihu differs from the friends in the position which he takes up here and in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-20.htm" title="In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand....">Job 34:20-33</a></span>. He is concerned in the meantime, however, with a theoretical defence of God’s justice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">10–19</span>. This charge of injustice Elihu rebuts, <span class="ital">first</span>, on the general ground of its impiety: God cannot be thought of as acting in the way Job asserted—He rewardeth every man according to his works (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-10.htm" title="Therefore listen to me you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity....">Job 34:10-12</a></span>); and <span class="ital">second</span>, he then resolves the general idea into two distinct thoughts, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-13.htm" title="Who has given him a charge over the earth? or who has disposed the whole world?...">Job 34:13-15</a></span>, and <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-16.htm" title="If now you have understanding, hear this: listen to the voice of my words....">Job 34:16-19</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding</span> (comp. ver. 2). Elihu repeats himself, wishing to call special attention to his justification of God (vers. 10-30). Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness. Elihu probably means that to do wickedness is contrary to the very nature and idea of God; but he does not express himself very clearly. And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. An evil God, a God who can do wrong, is a contradiction in terms - an impossible, inconceivable idea. Devil-worshippers, if there are or ever have been such persons, do not conceive of the object of their worship as really God, but as a powerful malignant spirit. Once rise to the height of the conception of a Power absolutely supreme, omniscient, omnipresent, the Author of all things, and it is impossible to imagine him as less than perfectly good. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then began Elihu and said:<p>  2  Hear, ye wise men, my words,<p>And ye experienced ones, give ear to me!<p>  3  For the ear trieth words,<p>As the palate tasteth by eating.<p>  4  Let us find out what is right,<p>Let us explore among ourselves what is good.<p>After his first speech Elihu has made a brief pause; now since Job is silent, he begins anew. &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, lxx correctly, here as in all other instances where the phrase occurs: &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, taking up the word he said. The wise and the knowing (Arab. &#8219;ulama&#770;), whose attention he bespeaks, are not Job and the three (Umbr., Hahn), who are indeed a party, and as such a subject for the arbitrative appearance of Elihu; also not every one capable of forming a judgment (Hirz.); but those in the circle of spectators and listeners which, as is assumed, has assembled round the disputants (Schlottm.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a> Elihu does not expressly mean his own ear, but that of the persons addressed: he establishes his summons to prove what he says by the general thought brought over from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>, and as there (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>), clothed in the form of the emblematic proverb, - that as there is a bodily, so there is also a mental organ of sense which tries its perceptions. &#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; is not intended as expressing a purpose (ad vescendum), but as a gerundive (vescendo). The phrase &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, occurring only here, signifies neither to institute a search for the purpose of decision (Schult. and others), since &#1489;&#1495;&#1512; does not signify to decide upon anything, nor to investigate a cause (Hahn), which would be &#1504;&#1489;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;, but to test and choose what is right, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>, after which the parallel runs: cognoscamus inter nos (i.e., in common) quid bonum. </body></html>
