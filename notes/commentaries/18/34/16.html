Elihu’s argument is the same with that of Abraham, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>, and that of St. Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)...">Romans 3:5-6</a>. If <span class="ital">God be unrighteous, how shall he judge, </span>or <span class="ital">govern the world? </span>And the argument is undeniable; if God were unjust, there would be nothing but injustice and confusion in the world; whereas we see there is a great deal of justice administered in the world, and all this must proceed from Him who is the fountain of all justice, and rule, and authority. And as the psalmist says, <span class="ital">He that formed the eye, shall he not see? </span>so we may say, He that makes men just, shall he be unjust? <span class="ital">Wilt thou condemn him that is most just? — </span>God, who hath given so many clear and unquestionable evidences of his justice, in giving just and holy laws, in encouraging and rewarding righteous persons in this life, and inflicting dreadful judgments upon tyrants and oppressors.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:16-30 Elihu appeals directly to Job himself. Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If now thou hast understanding hear this - This appears to be addressed to Job. The discourse before this had been directed to his three friends, but Elihu appears here to have turned to Job, and to have made a solemn appeal to him, whether this were not so. In the subsequent verses he remonstrates with him about his views, and shows him that what he had said implied severe reflections on the character and government of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Not as calling his understanding in question, as if he, had none; for Job was a very understanding man; he had not lost his natural understanding by his afflictions, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-13.htm">Job 6:13</a>; nor was he without an understanding of divine things, as his speeches and answers show; but rather it is taken for granted that he was a man of understanding: "if" or "seeing" thou hast understanding, art a man of knowledge and intelligence, therefore hearken and attend to what has been said or about to be said; though, as some Jewish interpreters (a) observe, the word is not a noun, but a verb, and is imperative, "understand thou now, hear this"; and then the sense is, "if" things are so as before related, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a>; then now understand this, take it into thy heart and mind, and well weigh and consider it: <p>hearken to the voice of my words; either the preceding or following ones. <p>(a) Jarchi, Bar Tzemach, in loc. so Cocceius, Schmidt, and Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16–19</span>. The second thought: without justice rule is impossible; and therefore injustice in the supreme Ruler is inconceivable. The thought is one that finds repeated expression in Scripture, as in the words of Abraham, “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>, and in those of St Paul, “Is God unrighteous …?

The clause which Elihu makes prominent in the following reply is the very axiom which the three defend, perfectly true in itself, but falsely applied by them: evil, wrong, are inconceivable on the part of God; instead of &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; it is only &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; in the second member of the verse, with the omission of the praep. - a frequent form of ellipsis, particularly in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-8.htm">Isaiah 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-14.htm">Isaiah 48:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>).
