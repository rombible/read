There is no distinction in the grave, but the meanest and most despised peasant is in a situation equal to that of his rich and powerful neighbour. The man of birth and fortune appears there to no advantage: he commands no place; he usurps no authority; neither does he lord it over the poorest or meanest of the human race. <span class="ital">And the servant is free from his master — </span>The most contemptible slave, who was entirely subject to the impositions and exactions of his owner, has got his discharge, and is now free from the power of him that tyrannized over him: a good reason this, why those who have power should use it moderately, and why those that are in subjection should take it patiently.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:11-19 Job complained of those present at his birth, for their tender attention to him. No creature comes into the world so helpless as man. God's power and providence upheld our frail lives, and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. Natural affection is put into parents' hearts by God. To desire to die that we may be with Christ, that we may be free from sin, is the effect and evidence of grace; but to desire to die, only that we may be delivered from the troubles of this life, savours of corruption. It is our wisdom and duty to make the best of that which is, be it living or dying; and so to live to the Lord, and die to the Lord, as in both to be his, Ro 14:8. Observe how Job describes the repose of the grave; There the wicked cease from troubling. When persecutors die, they can no longer persecute. There the weary are at rest: in the grave they rest from all their labours. And a rest from sin, temptation, conflict, sorrows, and labours, remains in the presence and enjoyment of God. There believers rest in Jesus, nay, as far as we trust in the Lord Jesus and obey him, we here find rest to our souls, though in the world we have tribulation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The small and the great are there - The old and the young, the high and the low. Death levels all. It shows no respect to age; it spares none because they are vigorous, young, or beautiful. This sentiment has probably been expressed in various forms in all languages, for all people are made deeply sensible of its truth. The Classic reader will recall the ancient proverb,<p>Mors sceptra ligonibus aequat,<p>And the language of Horace:<p>Aequae lege Necessitas<p>Sortitur insignes et imos.<p>Omne capax movet urna nomen.<p>Tristis unda scilicet omnibus,<p>Quicunque terrae munere vescimur,<p>Enaviganda, sive reges,<p>Sive inopes erimus coloni.<p>Divesne prisco natus ab lnacho<p>Nil interest, an pauper et infima<p>De gente sub dio moreris<p>Victima nil miserantis Orci.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. servant&#8212;The slave is there manumitted from slavery.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The small and great, </span> i.e. persons of all qualifies and conditions, whether higher or lower. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Are there, </span> in the same place and state, all those kinds of distinctions and differences being for ever abolished. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The small and great are there,.... Both as to age, and with respect to bulk and strength of body, and also to estate and dignity; children and men, or those of low and high stature, or in a mean or more exalted state of life, as to riches and honour, these all come to the grave without any difference, and lie there without any distinction (y) "little and great are there all one"; as Mr. Broughton renders the words, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, <p>and the servant is free from his master; death dissolves all relations among men, and takes away the power that one has legally over another, as the husband over the wife, who at death is loosed from the law and power of her husband, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2</a>; and so parents over their children, and masters over their servants; there the master and the servant are together, without any superiority of the one to the other: the consideration of all the above things made death and the state of the dead in the grave appear to Job much more preferable than life in his present circumstances; and therefore, since it had not seized on him sooner, and as soon as he before had wished it had, he desires it might not be long before it came upon him, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20</a>. <p>(y) "Grandia cum parvis Orcus metit".

Bttch. de inferis, 298 (who, however, prefers to read &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, wide streets), rightly directs attention to the difference between &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1504;&#1492; (to rebuild the ruins) and &#1500;&#1493; &#1489;&#1504;&#1492; &#1495; (to build ruins for one's self). With &#1488;&#1493; like things are then ranged after one another. Builders of the pyramids, millionaires, abortions (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>), and the still-born: all these are removed from the sufferings of this life in their quiet of the grave, be their grave a "ruin" gazed upon by their descendants, or a hole dug out in the earth, and again filled in as it was before. </body></html>
