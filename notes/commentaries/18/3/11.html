No creature comes into the world so helpless as man. God's power and providence upheld our frail lives, and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. Natural affection is put into parents' hearts by God. To desire to die that we may be with Christ, that we may be free from sin, is the effect and evidence of grace; but to desire to die, only that we may be delivered from the troubles of this life, savours of corruption. It is our wisdom and duty to make the best of that which is, be it living or dying; and so to live to the Lord, and die to the Lord, as in both to be his, Ro 14:8. Observe how Job describes the repose of the grave; There the wicked cease from troubling. When persecutors die, they can no longer persecute. There the weary are at rest: in the grave they rest from all their labours. And a rest from sin, temptation, conflict, sorrows, and labours, remains in the presence and enjoyment of God. There believers rest in Jesus, nay, as far as we trust in the Lord Jesus and obey him, we here find rest to our souls, though in the world we have tribulation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why died I not from the womb? - Why did I not die as soon as I was born? Why were any pains taken to keep me alive? The suggestion of this question leads Job in the following verses into the beautiful description, of what he would have been if he had then died. He complains, therefore, that any pains were taken by his friends to keep him alive, and that he was not suffered peacefully to expire.<p>Gave up the ghost - A phrase that is often used in the English version of the Bible to denote death; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-20.htm">Job 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-10.htm">Job 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-50.htm">Matthew 27:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-10.htm">Acts 5:10</a>. It conveys an idea, however, which is not necessarily in the original, though the idea in itself is not incorrect. The idea conveyed by the phrase is that of yielding up the "spirit" or "soul," while the sense of the original here and elsewhere is simply "to expire, to die." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. dawning of the day&#8212;literally, "eyelashes of morning."

Would God I had died from my birth<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If he must be born, Job asks, Why he did not die from the womb? his eye turning to the next possibility and chance of escaping sorrow. Had he died he would have been at peace; and the picture of the painless stillness of death fascinates him and he dwells long on it, counting over with a minute particularity all classes, kings and prisoners, slaves and masters, small and great, who there drink deep of a common peace, escaping the unquietness of life, for life upon the earth, however lived, is full of a painful restlessness. The thought of this stillness of death brings a certain calm to the sufferer’s mind, and the passionateness of his former words subsides.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why died I not from the womb?</span> "<span class="accented">From</span> the womb" must mean, "as soon as I came out of the womb," not "while I yet remained within it" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-17.htm">Jeremiah 20:17</a>, "Because he slew me not from <span class="accented">the womb"</span>). Many of the ancients thought that it was best not to be born; and next best, if one were born, to quit the earth as soon as possible. Herodotus says that with the Trauri, a tribe of Thracians, it was the custom, whenever a child was born, for all its kindred to sit round it in a circle, and weep for the woes that it would have to endure now that it was come into the world; while, on the other hand, whenever a person died, they buried him with laughter and rejoicings, since they said that he was now free from a host of sufferings, and enjoyed the completest happiness (Herod., 5:4). Sophocles expresses the feeling with great terseness and force: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (Ed. Col., 1225-1228): "Not to be born is best of all; once born, next best it is by far to go back there from whence one came as speedily as possible." Modern pessimism sums up all in the phrase that "life is not worth living." <span class="cmt_word">Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</span> As so often, the  second clause of the distich repeats the idea of the first, merely varying the phraseology. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  3  Perish the day wherein I was born.<p>And the night which said, A man-child is conceived!<p>  4  Let that day become darkness;<p>Let not Eloah ask after it from above,<p>And let not the light shine on it.<p>  5  May darkness and the shadow of death purchase it back;<p>Let a cloud lie upon it;<p>May that which obscures the day terrify it.<p>The curse is against the day of his birth and the night of his conception as recurring yearly, not against the actual first day (Schlottm.), to which the imprecations which follow are not pertinent. Job wishes his birth-day may become dies ater, swallowed up by darkness as into nothing. The elliptical relative clauses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a> (Ges. 123, 3; cf. 127, 4, c), become clear from the translation. Transl. the night (&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; with parag. He is masc.) which said, not: in which they said; the night alone was witness of this beginning of the development of a man-child, and made report of it to the High One, to whom it is subordinate. Day emerges from the darkness as Eloah from above (as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-2.htm">Job 31:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-28.htm">Job 31:28</a>), i.e., He who reigns over the changes here below, asks after it; interests Himself in His own (&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;). Job wishes his birth-day may not rejoice in this. The relations of this his birth-day are darkness and the shadow of death. These are to redeem it, as, according to the right of kinsmen, family property is redeemed when it has got into a stranger's hands. This is the meaning of &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), not  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, inquinent (Targ.). &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; is collective, as &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, mass of cloud. Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; (the Caph of which seems pointed as praepos), we must read with Ewald (157, a), Olshausen, (187, b), and others, &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, after the form &#1495;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, darkness, dark flashing (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>), &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;, tapestry, unless we are willing to accept a form of noun without example elsewhere. The word signifies an obscuring, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, to glow with heat, because the greater the glow the deeper the blackness it leaves behind. All that ever obscures a day is to overtake and render terrible that day.<p>(Note: We may compare here, and further, on, Constance's outburst of despair in King John (3:1 and 3:4). Shakespeare, like Goethe, enriches himself from the book of Job.) </body></html>
