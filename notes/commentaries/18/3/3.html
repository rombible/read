Here the metrical part of this book begins, which in the original Hebrew is broken into short verses, and is very beautiful, thus: <span class="greekheb">שׂאבד יום אולד בו</span>— <span class="ital">Jobad jom ivaled bo,</span> <span class="greekheb">והלילה אמר הרה גבר</span>— <span class="ital">Vehalailah amar horah geber.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, A man child is conceived.</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Let the day perish, </span>&c. — So far from desiring, according to the general and prevailing custom, that my birth-day should be celebrated; that any singular tokens of joy and gratulation should be expressed on it, in remembrance of my coming into the world, my earnest and passionate desire is, that it may not so much as be reckoned one of the days of the year, but that both it and the remembrance of it may be utterly lost. <span class="ital">And the night in which it was said — </span>With joy and triumph, as happy tidings, <span class="ital">There is a man-child conceived — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">brought forth, </span>as the word <span class="greekheb">הרה</span>, <span class="ital">harah, </span>signifies, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-17.htm" title="And the sons of Ezra were, Jether, and Mered, and Epher, and Jalon: and she bore Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa.">1 Chronicles 4:17</a>,) for the exact time of conception is commonly unknown to women themselves, and certainly is not wont to be reported among men, as this day is supposed to be. Indeed, this latter clause is only a repetition of the former, expressing that, whether it was day or night when he was born, he wished the time to be forgotten. Heath translates the words, <span class="ital">And the night which said, See, a man-child is born; </span>and he observes, from Schultens, “that the bearing of a son was considered a matter of great consequence among the Arabians; the form of their appreciation of happiness to a new-married woman being, ‘May you live happy, and bring forth male children.’“<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-10 For seven days Job's friends sat by him in silence, without offering consolidation: at the same time Satan assaulted his mind to shake his confidence, and to fill him with hard thoughts of God. The permission seems to have extended to this, as well as to torturing the body. Job was an especial type of Christ, whose inward sufferings, both in the garden and on the cross, were the most dreadful; and arose in a great degree from the assaults of Satan in that hour of darkness. These inward trials show the reason of the change that took place in Job's conduct, from entire submission to the will of God, to the impatience which appears here, and in other parts of the book. The believer, who knows that a few drops of this bitter cup are more dreadful than the sharpest outward afflictions, while he is favoured with a sweet sense of the love and presence of God, will not be surprised to find that Job proved a man of like passions with others; but will rejoice that Satan was disappointed, and could not prove him a hypocrite; for though he cursed the day of his birth, he did not curse his God. Job doubtless was afterwards ashamed of these wishes, and we may suppose what must be his judgment of them now he is in everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the day perish - "Perish the day! O that there had never been such a day! Let it be blotted from the memory of man! There is something singularly bold, sublime, and "wild" in this exclamation. It is a burst of feeling where there had been long restraint, and where now it breaks forth in the most vehement and impassioned manner. The word "perish" here &#1497;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;  yo'bad expresses the "optative," and indicates strong desire. So the Septuagint, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  Apoloito, "may it perish," or be destroyed; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-18.htm">Job 10:18</a>. "O that I had given up the ghost." Dr. Good says of this exclamation, "There is nothing that I know of, ia ancient or modern poetry, equal to the entire burst, whether in the wildness and horror of the imprecations. or the terrible sublimity of its imagery." The boldest and most animated of the Hebrew poets have imitated it, and have expressed themselves in almost the same language, in scenes of distress. A remarkably similar expression of feeling is made by Jeremiah.<p>Cursed be the day wherein I was born:<p>Let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed!<p>Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying,<p>"A man child is born unto thee,"<p>Making him very glad.<p>Be that man as the cities which yahweh overthrew and repented not!<p>Yea, let him hear the outcry in the morning,<p>And the lamentation at noon day!<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. the night in which&#8212;rather "the night which said." The words in italics are not in the Hebrew. Night is personified and poetically made to speak. So in Job 3:7, and in Ps 19:2.

Here begins Job's form of cursing his day, and which explains what is meant by it; and it may be understood either of the identical day of his birth, and then the sense is, that he wished that had never been, or, in other words, that he had never been born; and though these were impossible, and Job knew it, and therefore such wishes may seem to be in vain, yet Job had a design herein, which was to show the greatness of his afflictions, and the sense he had of them: or else of his birthday, as it returned year after year; and then his meaning is, let it not be kept and observed with any solemnity, with feasting and other expressions of joy, as the birthdays of great personages especially were, and his own very probably had been, since his children's were, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a>; but now he desires it might not be so for the future, but be entirely disregarded; he would have it perish out of his own memory, and out of the memory of others, and even be struck out of the calendar, and not be reckoned with the days of the month and year, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-6.htm">Job 3:6</a>; both may be intended, both the very day on which he was born, and the yearly return of it: <p>and the night in which it was said, there is a man child conceived; that is, let that night perish also; he wishes it had not been, or he had not been conceived, or for the future be never mentioned, but eternally forgotten: Job goes back to his conception, as being the spring of his sorrows; for this he knew as well as David, that he was shapen in iniquity, and conceived in sin, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>; but rather, since the particular night or time of conception is not ordinarily, easily, and exactly known by women themselves, and much less by men; and more especially it could not be told what sex it was, whether male or female that was conceived, and the tidings of it could not be brought by any; it seems better with Aben Ezra to render the word (w), "there is a man child brought forth", which used to be an occasion of joy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>; and so the word is used to bear or bring forth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-17.htm">1 Chronicles 4:17</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-15.htm">Jeremiah 20:15</a>; and, according to him, it was a doubt whether Job was born in the day or in the night; but be it which it will, if he was born in the day, he desires it might perish; and if in the night, he wishes the same to that; though the words may be rendered in a beautiful and elegant manner nearer the original, "and the night which said, a man child is conceived" (x); representing, by a prosopopoeia, the night as a person conscious of the conception, as an eyewitness of it, and exulting at it, as Schultens observes. <p>(w)  "in lucem editus est vir", Mercerus; "creatus, progenitus", Drusius, so the Targum; "conceptus et natus est vir, vel mas", Michaelis; so Ben Melech.
