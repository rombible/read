Let it be our great and constant care to get ready for another world: and then let us leave it to God to order the circumstances of our removal thither.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:20-26 Job was like a man who had lost his way, and had no prospect of escape, or hope of better times. But surely he was in an ill frame for death when so unwilling to live. Let it be our constant care to get ready for another world, and then leave it to God to order our removal thither as he thinks fit. Grace teaches us in the midst of life's greatest comforts, to be willing to die, and in the midst of its greatest crosses, to be willing to live. Job's way was hid; he knew not wherefore God contended with him. The afflicted and tempted Christian knows something of this heaviness; when he has been looking too much at the things that are seen, some chastisement of his heavenly Father will give him a taste of this disgust of life, and a glance at these dark regions of despair. Nor is there any help until God shall restore to him the joys of his salvation. Blessed be God, the earth is full of his goodness, though full of man's wickedness. This life may be made tolerable if we attend to our duty. We look for eternal mercy, if willing to receive Christ as our Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which rejoice exceedingly - Hebrew "Who rejoice upon joy or exultation" (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;  'el-g&#305;&#770;yl), that is, with exceedingly great joy.<p>When they can find the grave - What an expression! How strikingly does it express the intense desire to die, and the depth of a man's sorrow, when it becomes a matter of exultation for him to be permitted to lie down in the corruption and decay of the tomb! A somewhat similiar sentiment occurs in Euripides, as quoted by Cicero, Tusc. Quaest. Lib. 1, cap. 48:<p>Nam nos decebat, doman<p>Lugere, ubi esset aliquis in lucem editus,<p>Humanae vitae varia reputantes mala;<p>At qui labores morte finisset graves<p>Hunc omni amicos laude et Lactitia exsequi. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Job 3:20-26.

Or, "which joy till they do skip again", as Mr. Broughton renders it, and to the same purport others (d); are so elated as to skip and dance for joy: <p>and are glad when they can find the grave; which is to be understood either of those who dig in the earth for hid treasure, such as is laid there by men; when they strike and hit upon a grave where they expect to find a booty; it being usual in former times to put much riches into the sepulchres of great personages, as Sanctius on the place observes; so Hyrcanus, opening the sepulchre of David, found in it three thousand talents of silver, as Josephus (e) relates: or rather this is said of the miserable and bitter in soul, who long for death, and seek after it; who, when they perceive any symptoms of its near approach, are exceedingly pleased, and rejoice at it, as when they observe the decays of nature, or any disorder and disease upon them which threaten with death; for this cannot be meant of the dead carrying to the grave, who are insensible of it, and of their being put into it. <p>(d)   "qu laetantur ad choream usque", Schultens, "quasi ad tripudium", Michaelis.

Job speaks as if he knew of such cases; and, no doubt, the fact of suicide proves that among men there are some who prefer to die rather than live. But suicides are seldom altogether in possession of their senses. Of sane men it may be doubted whether one in a thousand, however miserable, really wishes to die, or is "glad when he can find the grave." In such thoughts as those to which Job here gives expression there is something morbid and unreal. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13  So should I now have lain and had quiet,<p>I should have slept, then it would have been well with me,<p>14  With kings and councillors of the earth,<p>Who built ruins for themselves,<p>15  Or with princes possessing gold,<p>Who filled their houses with silver:<p>16  Or like a hidden untimely birth I had not been,<p>And as children that have never seen the light.<p>The perf. and interchanging fut. have the signification of oriental imperfecta conjunctivi, according to Ges. 126, 5; &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is the usual expression after hypothetical clauses, and takes the perf. if the preceding clause specifies a condition which has not occurred in the past (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-10.htm">Genesis 43:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-29.htm">Numbers 22:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-33.htm">Numbers 22:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-30.htm">1 Samuel 14:30</a>), the fut. if a condition is not existing in the present (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-3.htm">Job 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-6.htm">Job 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-19.htm">Job 13:19</a>).

Ruins, &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, are uninhabited desolate buildings, elsewhere such as have become, here such as are from the first intended to remain, uninhabited and desolate, consequently sepulchres, mausoleums; probably, since the book has Egyptian allusions, in other passages also, a play upon the pyramids, in whose name (III-XPAM, according to Coptic glossaries) III is the Egyptian article (vid., Bunsen, Aeg. ii. 361); Arab. without the art. hira&#770;m or ahra&#770;m (vid., Abdollatf, ed. de Sacy, p. 293, s.).<p>(Note: We think that &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; sounds rather like &#1495;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the name of the pyramids, as the Arabic haram (instead of hharam), derived from XPAM, recalls harma&#770;n (e.g., beith harma&#770;n, a house in ruins), the synonym of hharda&#770;n (&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1488;&#1503;).)<p>Also Renan: Qui se btissent des mausoles. Bttch. de inferis, 298 (who, however, prefers to read &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, wide streets), rightly directs attention to the difference between &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1504;&#1492; (to rebuild the ruins) and &#1500;&#1493; &#1489;&#1504;&#1492; &#1495; (to build ruins for one's self).

Builders of the pyramids, millionaires, abortions (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>), and the still-born: all these are removed from the sufferings of this life in their quiet of the grave, be their grave a "ruin" gazed upon by their descendants, or a hole dug out in the earth, and again filled in as it was before. </body></html>
