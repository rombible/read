But surely he was in an ill frame for death when so unwilling to live. Let it be our constant care to get ready for another world, and then leave it to God to order our removal thither as he thinks fit. Grace teaches us in the midst of life's greatest comforts, to be willing to die, and in the midst of its greatest crosses, to be willing to live. Job's way was hid; he knew not wherefore God contended with him. The afflicted and tempted Christian knows something of this heaviness; when he has been looking too much at the things that are seen, some chastisement of his heavenly Father will give him a taste of this disgust of life, and a glance at these dark regions of despair. Nor is there any help until God shall restore to him the joys of his salvation. Blessed be God, the earth is full of his goodness, though full of man's wickedness. This life may be made tolerable if we attend to our duty. We look for eternal mercy, if willing to receive Christ as our Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why is light given "to a man uhose way is hid?" That is, who does not know what way to take, and who sees no escape from the misery that surrounds him.<p>Whom God hath hedged in - See Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>. The meaning here is, that God had surrounded him as with a high wall or hedge, so that he could not move freely. Job asks with impatience, why light, that is, life, should be given to such a man? Why should he not be permitted to die? This closes the complaint of Job, and the remaining verses of the chapter contain a statement of his sorrowful condition, and of the fact that he had now been called to suffer all that he had ever apprehended. - In regard to the questions here proposed by Job J<a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/3-20.htm">Obadiah 3:20-23</a>, we may remark, that; there was doubtless much impatience on his part, and not a little improper feeling. The language shows that Job was not absolutely sinless; but let us not harshly blame him. What he says, is a "statement" of feelings which often pass through the mind, though they are not often expressed. Who, in deep and protracted sorrows, has not found such questions rising up in his soul - questions which required all his energy and all his firmness of principle, and all the strength which he could gain by prayer, to suppress? To the questions themselves, it may be difficult to give an answer; and it is certain that none of the friends of Job furnished a solution of the difficulty. When it is asked, why man is kept in misery on earth, when he would be glad to be released by death, perhaps the following, among others, may be the reasons:<p>(1) Those sufferings may be the very means which are needful to develope the true state of the soul. Such was the case with Job.<p>(2) They may be the proper punishment of sin in the heart, of which the individual was not fully aware, but which may be distinctly seen by God. There may be pride, and the love of ease, and self-confidence, and ambition, and a desire of reputation. Such appear to have been some of the besetting sins of Job.<p>(3) They are needful to teach true submission, and to show whether a man is willing to resign himself to God.<p>(4) They may be the very things which are necessary to prepare the individual to die. At the same time that people often desire death, and feel that it would be a relief, it might be to them the greatest possible calamity. They may be wholly unprepared for it. For a sinner, the grave contains no rest; the eternal world furnishes no repose.<p>One design of God in such sorrows may be, to show to the wicked how "intolerable" will he future pain, and how important it is for them to be ready to die. If they cannot bear the pains and sorrows of a few hours in this short life. how can they endure eternal sufferings? If it is so desirable to be released from the sorrows of the body here, - if it is felt that the grave, with all that is repulsive in it, would be a place of repose, how important is it to find some way to be secured from everlasting pains! The true place of release from suffering for a sinner, is not the grave; it is in the pardoning mercy of God, and in that pure heaven to which he is invited through the blood of the cross. In that holy heaven is the only real repose from suffering and from sin; and heaven will be all the sweeter in proportion to the extremity of pain which is endured on earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. whose way is hid&#8212;The picture of Job is drawn from a wanderer who has lost his way, and who is hedged in, so as to have no exit of escape (Ho 2:6; La 3:7, 9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Why is light given?</span> these words are conveniently supplied out of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm" title="Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped,">Job 1:20</a></span>, where they are, all the following words hitherto being joined in construction and sense with them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whose way is hid, </span> to wit, from him who knows not his <span class="ital">way</span>, i.e. which way to turn himself, what course to take to comfort himself in his miseries, or to get out of them; what method to use to please and reconcile that God who is so angry with him, seeing his sincere and exact piety, to which God is witness, doth not satisfy him; or what the end of these calamities will be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whom God hath hedged in; </span> not with a hedge of defence, like that <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-10.htm" title="Have not you made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? you have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.">Job 1:10</a></span>, but of offence and restraint, i.e. whom God hath put as it were in prison or pound, or like cattle in grounds enclosed with a high and strong hedge, over or through which they cannot get; so that he can see no way nor possibility to escape, but all refuge fails him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,.... Some of the Jewish writers connect this with <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-22.htm">Job 3:22</a>, thus; "who rejoice and are glad when they find a grave for a man", &amp;c. but it should be observed that such are said to rejoice at finding a grave, not for others, but for themselves; the words stand in better connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20</a>, from whence the supplement is taken in our version and others; and so it is a continuation or repetition of the expostulation why light and life, or the light of the living, should be given to persons as before described, and here more largely; and Job himself is principally designed, as is generally thought, whose way, according to him, was hid from the Lord, neglected and not cared for by him but overlooked and slighted, and no regard had to the injuries done him, as the church also complains, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a>; or front whom the way of the Lord was hid; his way in the present afflictive dispensations of Providence, the causes and reasons of which he could not understand; not being conscious of any notorious sin committed, indulged, and continued in, that should bring these troubles on him: or the good and right way was hid from him in which he should walk; he was at a loss to know which was that way, since by his afflictions he was ready to conclude that the way he had been walking in was not the right, and all his religion was in vain; and according to this sense he laboured under the same temptation as Asaph did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a>; or his way of escape out of his present troubles was unknown to him; he saw no way open for him, but shut up on every side: or there was no way for others to come to him, at least they cared not for it; he who had used to have a large levee, some to have his counsel and advice, and to be instructed by him, others to ask relief of him, and many of the highest rank and figure to visit, caress, and compliment him; but now all had forsaken him, his brethren and acquaintance, and his kinsfolk and familiar friends kept at a distance from him, as if they knew not the way to him: <p>and whom God hath hedged in? not with the hedge of his power, providence, and protection, as before; but with thorns and afflictions, and in such manner as he could not get out, or extricate himself; all avenues and ways of escape being blocked up, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7</a>; though, after all, the words may be considered as a concession, and as descriptive of a man the reverse of himself, and be supplied thus; "indeed light may be given to a man", a mighty man, as the word (e) signifies, a man strong, hale, and robust; "whose way is hid", or "covered" (f); who is hid in the secret of God's presence, and in the pavilion of his power; who dwells in his secret place, and under the shadow of the Almighty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; who is under the shelter of his providence, preserved from diseases of body, and protected from the plunder and depredations of enemies, and enjoys great affluence and prosperity, as his three friends about him did, and whom he may point at: "and whom God hath hedged in"; as he had formerly set a hedge about him in his providence, though now he had plucked it up; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>. <p>(e) "emphatice ponitur saepe, ut notetur praepollentia", Coccei.

His way is hid or lost, the clear path of his former life has suddenly broken off, or as the second clause of the verse expresses it, has been shut in by a hedge, set by God across it. The reference is not merely to his physical calamities, but much more to the speculative and religious perplexities which his calamities wove about his mind, and from which he can find no outlet, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-8.htm" title="He has fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness in my paths.">Job 19:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - Why is light given <span class="cmt_word">to a man whose way is hid?</span> "Obscured," that is, "darkened," "placed under a cloud" (comp. ver. 20, where the sentiment is nearly the same). <span class="cmt_word">And whom God hath hedged in</span>. Not in the way of protection, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>, but of obstruction and confinement: (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-6.htm">Hosea 2:6</a>).
