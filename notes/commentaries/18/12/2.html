We are apt to call reproofs reproaches, and to think ourselves mocked when advised and admonished; this is our folly; yet here was colour for this charge. He suspected the true cause of their conduct to be, that they despised him who was fallen into poverty. It is the way of the world. Even the just, upright man, if he comes under a cloud, is looked upon with contempt.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No doubt but ye are the people - That is, the only wise people. You have engrossed all the wisdom of the world, and all else are to be regarded as fools. This is evidently the language of severe sarcasm; and it shows a spirit fretted and chafed by their reproaches. Job felt contempt for their reasoning. and meant to intimate that their maxims, on which they placed so much reliance, were common-place, and such as every one was familar with.<p>And wisdom shall die with you - This is ironical, but it is language such as is common perhaps every where. "The people of the East," says Roberts, "take great pleasure in irony, and some of their satirical sayings are very cutting. When a sage intimates that he has superior wisdom or when he is disposed to rally another for his meagrc attainments, he says, 'Yes, yes, you are the man! ' 'Your wisdom is like the sea.' 'When you die, whither will wisdom go?'" In a serious sense, language like this is used by the Classical writers to describe the death of eminently great or good men. They speak of wisdom, bravery, piety, or music, as dying with them. Thus, Moschus, Idyll. iii.12.<p>&#x39f;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;<p>&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x394;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;.<p>Hotti bio&#772;n tethne&#772;ken ho bo&#772;kolos, esti sun auto&#772;<p>Kai to melos tethnake, kai o&#772;leto Do&#772;ris aeidos.<p>"Bion the swain is dead, and with him song<p>Has died, and the Doric muse has perished."<p>Expressions like these are common.

Which is said not seriously, meaning that they were but of the common people, that are generally ignorant, and have but little knowledge, at least of things sublime, especially in matters of religion; wherefore, though they took upon them to be his teachers and dictators to him, and censors of him, they were not above the rank, but in the class of people of low and mean understandings; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-49.htm">John 7:49</a>; this sense indeed agrees with what is after said, "who knoweth not such things as these?" but since Job compares himself with them, and asserts he is not inferior to them, it supposes them to have a degree of knowledge and understanding of things somewhat above the common people; wherefore these words are to be taken ironically, exposing their vanity and self-conceit: "ye are the people"; the only, and all the people in the world of importance and consequence for good sense and wisdom; the only wise and knowing folk, the men of reason and understanding; all the rest are but fools and asses, or like the wild ass's colt, as Zophar had said, and which Job took as pointing to him; so the word in the Arabic language (c) signifies the more excellent and better sort of people; or, ye are the only people of God, his covenant people, his servants; that are made acquainted with the secrets of wisdom, as none else are: <p>and wisdom shall die with you; you have all the wisdom of the world, and when you die it will be all gone; there will be none left in the world: thus he represents them as monopolizers and engrossers of wisdom and knowledge, full of it in their conceit, allowing none to have any share with them: and by all this he not only upbraids them with their vanity and self-conceit, but puts them in mind, that, as wise as they were, they must die; and that, though their wisdom with respect to them, or any use they could make of it in the grave, where there is none, would die too; or that their wisdom was but the wisdom of the world, which comes to nought; yet there would be wisdom still in the world, and that which is true, which God makes known to men, even the wisdom of God in a mystery, the wisdom hid in himself; and who has the residue of the Spirit and his gifts to instruct men in it, and qualify them to be teachers of others; by which means, though men, even the best of men, die, yet the word of God, the means of true wisdom and knowledge, will always abide. <p>(c) Golii Lex.
