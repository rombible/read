Why is it that the counsel of the wisest sometimes faileth, as with Ahitophel—the bravery of the boldest sometimes forsaketh them? but because there is One working underneath it all for His own ends and to His own glory, as seemeth Him good. Zophar, with all his common sense, had scarcely risen to the perception of this truth, for while Job maintained that there was always a deeper depth, he was prepared, at all events, to imply that the dealings of God were intelligible, and approved themselves to the conceptions of human equity. Job, on the other hand, declared that they were inscrutable, and, consequently, from their very darkness, suggested the necessity for faith His teaching here may seem to savour of fatalism, but that is simply because he deals only with one side of the problem. Had he found occasion, he would have stated with equal force the correlative truth of the absolute responsibility of man, even though but as clay in the hands of the potter; for, in fact, were it not so, how then should God judge the world? Into the mazes of this problem Job enters not, being concerned with other questions and mysteries. Job s conception, therefore, of the righteous government of God as far transcended that of his friends as their estimate of his righteousness fell short of the truth. Justly, therefore, he exclaims, “I am not inferior unto you.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/12-23.htm" title="He increases the nations, and destroys them: he enlarges the nations, and straitens them again....">Job 12:23-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">He increaseth the nations, </span>&c. — What he had hitherto said of princes, he now applies to nations and people, whom God either increases or diminishes as he pleases. <span class="ital">He enlargeth the nations — </span>He multiplies them so that they are forced to send forth colonies into other lands; <span class="ital">and straiteneth them again — </span>Diminishes them by war, famine, or pestilence: or, as <span class="greekheb">ינחם</span>, <span class="ital">janchem, </span>more properly signifies, leadeth them in, or bringeth them back, namely, into their own land, and confineth them there. So that whole nations, as well as their princes, are perfectly under his power, and he enlarges their bounds, or reduces them into more narrow limits, as he pleaseth. <span class="ital">He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people</span> — Deprives them both of courage and judgment, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness; that is, fills them with confusion, uncertainty, and perplexity of mind, so that they know not which way to turn themselves. <span class="ital">They grope in the dark — </span>Like men that cannot see their way. <span class="ital">And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man — </span>Who reels hither and thither without any certainty.

It were well if wise and good men, who differ about lesser things, would see how it is for their honour and comfort, and the good of others, to dwell most upon the great things in which they agree. Here are no complaints, or reflections. He gives many instances of God's powerful management of the children of men, overruling all their counsels, and overcoming all their oppositions. Having all strength and wisdom, God knows how to make use, even of those who are foolish and bad; otherwise there is so little wisdom and so little honesty in the world, that all had been in confusion and ruin long ago. These important truths were suited to convince the disputants that they were out of their depth in attempting to assign the Lord's reasons for afflicting Job; his ways are unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out. Let us remark what beautiful illustrations there are in the word of God, confirming his sovereignty, and wisdom in that sovereignty: but the highest and infinitely the most important is, that the Lord Jesus was crucified by the malice of the Jews; and who but the Lord could have known that this one event was the salvation of the world?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them - He has entire control over them. The sources of prosperity are in his hand, and at his pleasure he can visit them with famine, pestilence, or war, and diminish their numbers and arrest their prosperity. Dr. Good renders this very improperly, "He letteth the nations grow licentious;" but the word &#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1488;  s&#769;a&#770;ga&#770;' never has this sense. It means, to make great; to multiply; to increase.<p>And straiteneth them again - Margin, "leadeth in." So the word &#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  na&#770;cha&#770;h means. The idea is, that he increases a nation so that it spreads abroad beyond its usual limits, and then at his pleasure leads them back again, or confines them within the limits from where they had emigrated. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

As he did before the flood, when the earth was tilled, and all over peopled with them, but at the flood he destroyed them at once. Sephorno interprets it of the seven nations in the land of Canaan, which were increased in it, and destroyed, to make way for the Israelites to inhabit it; and this has since been verified in other kingdoms, large and populous, and brought to destruction, particularly in the four monarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman, and will be in the antichristian states and nations of the world: <p>he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again; or "stretcheth" or "spreadeth out the nations" (c), as he did all over the earth before the deluge, and then most remarkably straitened them, when they were reduced to so small a number as to be contained in a single ark: "or leads them" (d); that is, "governs them", as Mr. Broughton renders the word, rules and overrules them, as large as they are; or leads them into captivity, as some Jewish writers (e), as the Israelites; though they have been enlarged, and became numerous, as it was promised they should, yet have been led into captivity, first the ten tribes by the Assyrians, and then the two tribes by the Chaldeans; the Targum is, "he spreadeth out a net for the nations, and leadeth them", that is, into it, so that they are taken in it, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>. <p>(c) "extendit", Tigurine version, Drusius, Mercerus; "expandit", Beza, Junius &amp; Tremellus, Piscator, Schmidt; "expandens", Schultens.

God's providence concerns itself, not only with the fate of individual men, bet also with that of nations. With Israel, his "peculiar people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>), he especially concerned himself, but not with Israel only. Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, Elam, Edom, Ammon, Moab, were likewise objects of his attention, of his guidance, of his chastening hand, of his avenging rod. Particular nations were consigned by God to the charge of particular angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 20</a>). At his pleasure he can "increase" nations by blessing them with extraordinary fecundity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7-12</a>), or "destroy" them by internal decay, by civil wars, or by the swords of their neighbours. <span class="cmt_word">He enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "enlarges their bounds, or diminishes them."

We find echoes of this utterance respecting God's paradoxical rule in the world in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>; and Isaiah's oracle on Egypt, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11-15</a>, furnishes an illustration in the reality.<p>It is but too natural to translate <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-18.htm">Job 12:18</a> : the bands of kings He looses (after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a>, &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497; &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;, Thou hast loosed my bands); but the relation of the two parts of the verse can then not be this: He unchains and chains kings (Hirz., Ew., Heiligst. Schlottm.), for the fut. consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1512; requires a contrast that is intimately connected with the context, and not of mere outward form: fetters in which kings have bound others (&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, gen. subjectivus) He looses, and binds them in fetters (Raschi), - an explanation which much commends itself, if &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; could only be justified as the construct of &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; by the remark that "the o sinks into u" (Ewald, 213, c). &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; does not once occur in the signification vinculum; but only the plur. &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, vincula, accord with the usage of the language, so that even the pointing &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512; proposed by Hirzel is a venture. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, however, as constr. of &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, correction, discipline, rule (i.e., as the domination of punishment, from &#1497;&#1505;&#1512;, castigare), is an equally suitable sense, and is probably connected by the poet with &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495; (a word very familiar to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-6.htm">Job 41:6</a>) on account of its relation both in sound and sense to &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-22.htm">Psalm 105:22</a>). The English translation is correct: He looseth the authority of kings. The antithesis is certainly lost, but the thoughts here moreover flow on in synonymous parallelism.</body></html>
