This Job opposes, and maintains that God herein acts as sovereign, and reserves that exact distribution of rewards and punishments for the other world. As if he had said, Thy opinion, O Zophar, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-14.htm" title="If iniquity be in your hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in your tabernacles.">Job 11:14</a>, &c.,) is confuted by daily experience; which shows that very wicked, injurious, and impudent oppressors, tyrants, and robbers, are so far from always meeting with those disappointments and miseries of which thou spakest as being their certain portion, that they frequently succeed in their iniquitous and daring enterprises, flourish in wealth and glory, and fill their houses with the goods of others, which they violently took away; of which the Chaldeans and Sabeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm" title="And the Sabeans fell on them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm" title="While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell on the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:17</a>) are a present and striking evidence. <span class="ital">And they that provoke God are secure — </span>They, whose common practice it is to despise and provoke God, are confident and safe, apparently living without danger or fear. <span class="ital">Into whose hands God bringeth abundantly — </span>So far is God from crushing such persons, that he seems to favour them with wonderful success; by his providence, puts into their hands the opportunities which they seek, of enriching themselves by injustice and oppression, and the persons and goods of other more righteous men, for which they lie in wait.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:6-11 Job appeals to facts. The most audacious robbers, oppressors, and impious wretches, often prosper. Yet this is not by fortune or chance; the Lord orders these things. Worldly prosperity is of small value in his sight: he has better things for his children. Job resolves all into the absolute proprietorship which God has in all the creatures. He demands from his friends liberty to judge of what they had said; he appeals to any fair judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tabernacles of robbers prosper - The tents or dwellings of robbers are safe and secure. This is Job's original proposition, to which he all along adheres. It is, that God does not deal with people in this life according to their character; and in support of this he now appeals to the fact that the tents or dwellings of robbers are safe. Arabia would furnish many illustrations of this, which could not be unknown to the friends of Job. The Arabs dwelt in tents, and they were then, as now, wandering, predatory tribes. They lived, to a great extent, by plunder, and doubtless Job could appeal to the observation of his friends for the proof of this. He affirms that so far from dealing with people according to their character, God often seemed to protect the public robber, and the blasphemer of his name.<p>Prosper - They are secure, tranquil, at rest - for so the Hebrew word means. They are not disturbed and broken in upon.<p>And they that provoke God - Or rather, "the tents are secure to those who provoke God." Dr. Good renders it, "and are fortresses to those who provoke God;" but the true idea is, that the tents of those who provoke God by their conduct are safe. God does not seem to notice them, or to come out in judgment against them.<p>Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly - Dr. Noyes renders this, "who carry their God in their hand;" but with much less accuracy, as it seems to me, than commonly characterizes his version. Eichhorn renders it in a sense somewhat similar:<p>Die ihre Faust fur ihre Gottheit achten - <p>"Who regard their fist as their God."<p>And so Stuhlman renders it:<p>Und wem die Faust fur Gottheit gilt - <p>"And to whom the fist avails for their God;"<p>That is, says he, Job means that this is the course of the world. Dr. Good renders it, "of him who hath created all these things with his hand" - still less accurately. In order to this, he is obliged to suppose an error in the text, but without the slightest authority. Jerome renders it as in our version. The Septuagint, "who provoke the Lord as if there would be no trial to them - &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  etasis auto&#772;n - here-after;" which certainly makes sense, but it was never obtained from the Hebrew. Rosenmuller renders it, "who have their own hand, that is, power for God;" a description, says he, of a wicked and violent man who thinks it right for him to do as he pleases. It seems to me, however, that the common interpretation, which is the most simple, is most in accordance with the Hebrew, and with the drift of the passage. According to this it means, that there is security to the man who lives to provoke that God who is constantly bringing to him in abundance the tokens of kindness. This is the fact on which Job is insisting - that God does not treat people in this world according to their real character, but that the wicked are prospered and the righteous are afflicted. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Job shows that the matter of fact opposes Zophar's theory (Job 11:14, 19, 20) that wickedness causes insecurity in men's "tabernacles." On the contrary, they who rob the "tabernacles" ("dwellings") of others "prosper securely" in their own.<p>into whose hand, &c.&#8212;rather, "who make a god of their own hand," that is, who regard their might as their only ruling principle [Umbreit].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The tabernacles of robbers prosper:</span> thy opinion, delivered <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-14.htm" title="If iniquity be in your hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in your tabernacles.">Job 11:14</a></span>, &c, is confuted by daily experience; which shows that the most wicked, and injurious, and impudent oppressors, tyrants, and robbers, are so far from meeting with those disappointments and miseries wherewith thou didst threaten them, that they commonly succeed in their cursed enterprises, and flourish in wealth and glory, and fill their houses with the goods of others which they violently took away; whereof the Chaldeans and Sabeans, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm" title="And the Sabeans fell on them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:15</a>,17</span>, are a present and pregnant evidence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They that provoke God are secure; </span> they whose common practice it is to despise and provoke God are confident and secure, live without danger or fear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly; </span> so far is God from crushing such persons, that he seems to favour them with wonderful success, and by his special and more than common providence <span class="ital">puts into their hands</span> the opportunities which they seek, and the persons and goods of other more righteous men, which they lie in wait for. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The tabernacles of robbers prosper,.... Such as the Chaldeans and Sabeans, who had robbed Job of his substance, and filled their houses with the spoils of others, and lived in the greatest fulness and prosperity, and whom he might have in his view; and the like is what has been since observed by good men, and has been a trial and temptation to them, not knowing well how to reconcile this to the justice and wisdom of God in providence, yet so it is, a fact that cannot be denied, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>; <p>and they that provoke God are secure; all sin is abominable to God, contrary to his nature, will, and law, and so provoking; yet there are some sins that are more provoking than others, as idolatry, blasphemy, murder, theft, robbery, rapine, and oppression, and the like, as well as attended with more aggravating circumstances; and yet many who are guilty of such enormous crimes, and God provoking iniquities, are "secure", live in the greatest tranquillity and safety, free from the incursions, invasions, and insults of others: "their houses", as Job elsewhere says, "are safe from fear", <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>; <p>into whose hand God bringeth abundantly; an abundance of the good things of this world, who have as much or more than heart can wish; whose belly is filled with hid treasure, whose grounds and fields bring forth plentifully, that they have no room to bestow their fruits; this, as it is an aggravation of their sin in provoking the God of their mercies, who is so liberal and bountiful to them, so it is the more full and express for the point in hand Job is confuting. Some, as Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom, understand this of idol makers and idol worshippers, and render the words, "who makes a god with his hand", or "carries a god in his hand" (l), and worships it; which others interpret of his doing what he will with God, having him, as it were, in his hand, or reckoning his hands his god, and thinks to do what he pleases (m). <p>(l)   "quique deum portant vel portat in manu sua", Tigurine version, Munster; so Bolducius, De Dieu, Schultens.
