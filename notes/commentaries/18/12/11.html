And he thereby demands from his friends the liberty of judging for himself of what they had said, and invites them to use the same liberty with respect to what he had advanced; wishing them to hear and judge of his words candidly and impartially, that they and he might agree in disavowing what should appear to be false or foolish, and in owning what was true and important.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:6-11 Job appeals to facts. The most audacious robbers, oppressors, and impious wretches, often prosper. Yet this is not by fortune or chance; the Lord orders these things. Worldly prosperity is of small value in his sight: he has better things for his children. Job resolves all into the absolute proprietorship which God has in all the creatures. He demands from his friends liberty to judge of what they had said; he appeals to any fair judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Doth not the ear try words? - The literal meaning of this, which is evidently a proverbial expression, is plain; but about its bearing here there is more difficulty. The literal sense is, that it is the office of the ear to mark the distinction of sounds, and to convey the sense to the soul. But in regard to the exact bearing of this proverb on the case in hand, commentators have not been agreed. Probably the sense is, that there ought to be a diligent attention to the signification of words, and to the meaning of a speaker, as one carefully tastes his food; and Job, perhaps, may be disposed to complain that his friends had not given that attention which they ought to have done to the true design and signification of his remarks. Or it may mean that man is endowed with the faculty of attending to the nature and qualities of objects, and that he ought to exercise that faculty in judging of the lessons which are taught respecting God or his works.<p>And the mouth - Margin, as in the Hebrew &#1495;&#1498;  che&#770;k - "palate." The word means not merely the palate, but the lower part of the mouth (Gesenius), and is especially used to designate the organ or the seat of taste; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-30.htm">Job 6:30</a>.<p>His meat - Its food - the word "meat" being used in Old English to denote all kinds of food. The sense is, man is endowed with the faculty of distinguishing what is wholesome from what is unwholesome, and he should, in like manner, exercise the faculty which God has given him of distinguishing the true from the false on moral subjects. He should not suppose that all that had been said, or that could be said, must necessarily be true. He should not suppose that merely to string together proverbs, and to utter common-place suggestions, was a mark of true wisdom. He should separate the valuable from the worthless, the true from the false, and the wholesome from the injurious. Job complains that his friends had not done this. They had shown no power of discrimination or selection. They had uttered common place apothegms, and they gathered adages of former times, without any discrimination, and had urged them in their arguments against him, whether pertinent or not. It was by this kind of irrelevant and miscellaneous remark that he felt that he had been mocked by his friends, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. As the mouth by tasting meats selects what pleases it, so the ear tries the words of others and retains what is convincing. Each chooses according to his taste. The connection with Job 12:12 is in reference to Bildad's appeal to the "ancients" (Job 8:8). You are right in appealing to them, since "with them was wisdom," &c. But you select such proverbs of theirs as suit your views; so I may borrow from the same such as suit mine.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As the mouth tasteth and thereby judgeth of meats, and as it liketh or disliketh, so it receiveth or rejecteth, what is put into it; so it is the office of the ear, or rather of the mind, which hears and receives the opinions and discourses of others by the ear, not rashly to approve or condemn every thing which it hears, but diligently and thoroughly to search and try whether it be true, and so to be embraced, or false, and to be rejected. Interpreters are much puzzled about the connexion and design of these words; but they seem to be either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. An apology for himself, why he did not comply with their opinion and all arguments, because they did not suit with his ear or mind; and though he had considered and tried them, he could not discern any weight in them. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. A reproof to his friends, that they did so hastily condemn his person and his doctrine without a strict and serious inquiry. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. A preface to his following discourse; whereby he invites them to hear and judge of his words and arguments more candidly and impartially; and not to scorn that he said because of his present poverty and misery, as men at ease used to do; nor to cast away the good for any mixture of bad with it; but calmly to weigh and debate things, both within and among themselves, and with him, that they and he too might all agree in disallowing whatsoever should appear to be false, and owning of every truth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Doth not the ear try words?.... Articulate sounds; and the mind by them judges whether what is expressed and designed by them is right or wrong, true or false, to be received or rejected; so such that have spiritual ears to hear, try the words of God and men, the wholesome words of Christ, and those of false teachers, which eat as a canker; and by their spiritual judgment can distinguish between the one and the other, discern those that differ, and approve those that are excellent, by bringing them to the standard of the word, the balance of the sanctuary, the Scriptures of truth: <p>and the mouth taste his meat? and judge of it, whether good or bad, or savoury or unsavoury, and so receive or reject it: thus such who have their taste changed, and relish spiritual things, can distinguish between the meat that perishes, and that which endures to everlasting life, even Christ, whose flesh is meat indeed; and those that have tasted that the Lord is gracious, and to whose taste the fruits of Christ and the doctrines of grace are sweet; these will desire the sincere milk of the word, and that strong meat in it, which belongs to discerning and experienced souls; and will feed by faith upon the pure word of the Gospel, and mix it with it, and reject all others. Job by this would signify, that the things his friends had been discoursing of, and which they thought were such deep and wonderful things, were as easy to be searched and found out, tried and judged of, as sounds by the ear, or food by the taste; and it may be also that hereby he suggests, that his doctrine, if it was impartially examined and tried by proper judges, it would appear as plain as anything tried by the ear, or tasted by the mouth. Some think that Job intends by this, that from the senses of hearing and tasting in men might be inferred the omniscience of God, his knowledge of all things, and his quick discernment of men, and their actions, since "he that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall not he see?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>.

"One who called on Eloah (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, for which &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468; is found in lxx at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-2.htm">Job 36:2</a>) and He heard him" is in apposition to the subject; likewise &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;, which is to be explained according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>, &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511; (from &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, Arab. s&#803;dq, to be hard, firm, stiff, straight), is one who in his conduct rules himself strictly according to the will of God; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, one whose thoughts are in all respects and without disguise what they should be-in one word: pure. Most old translators (Targ., Vulg., Luther) give &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; the signification, a torch. Thus e.g., Levi v. Gerson explains: "According to the view of the prosperous and carnally secure, he who is ready for falterings of the feet, i.e., likely to fall, is like a lighted torch which burns away and destroys whatever comes in contact with it, and therefore one keeps aloof from him; but it is also more than this: he is an object of contempt in their eyes." Job might not inappropriately say, that in the eyes of the prosperous he is like a despised, cast-away torch (comp. the similar figure, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>, like a branch that is rejected with contempt); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a> would be suitably connected with this if &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; could be derived from a substantive &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;, vacillatio, but neither the usage of the language nor the scriptio plena (after which Jerome translates tempus statutum, and consequently has in mind the &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, times of festal pilgrimages, which are also called &#1512;&#1512;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; in later times), nor the vowel pointing (instead of which &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; would be expected), is favourable to this. &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; signifies vacillantes pede, those whose prosperity is shaken, and who are in danger of destruction that is near at hand. We therefore, like Abenezra and modern expositors, who are here happily agreed, take &#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1491; as composed of &#1500; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, a word common to the books of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a>) and Proverbs (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22</a>), which is compared by the Jewish lexicographers, according both to form and meaning, to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>) and &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;, and perhaps signifies originally dissolution (comp. &#1508;&#1491;&#1492;), decease (Syr. f'jodo, escape; Arab. faid, dying), fall, then generally calamity, misfortune: contempt (befits) misfortune, according to the thoughts (or thinking), idea of the prosperous. The pointing wavers between &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; and the more authorized &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, with which Parchon compares the nouns &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; the &#1514;, like &#1491; in the latter word, has Dag. lene, since the punctuation is in this respect not quite consistent, or follows laws at present unknown (comp. Ges. 21, rem. 2). <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a> is now suitably connected: ready (with reference to &#1489;&#1493;&#1494;) for those who stumble, i.e., contempt certainly awaits such, it is ready and waiting for them, &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-2.htm">Exodus 34:2</a>.<p>While the unfortunate, in spite of his innocence, has thus only to expect contempt, the tents, i.e., dwellings and possessions, of the oppressor and the marauder remain in prosperity; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, an intensive form used not only in pause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>) and with greater distinctives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-6.htm">Psalm 122:6</a>), but also in passages where it receives no such accent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>).

The verbal clause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>) is followed by a substantival clause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; is an abstract plural from &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, perfectly secure; therefore: the most care-less security is the portion of those who provoke God (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;); <p>(Note: Luther takes &#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; as the adverb to &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;: und toben wider Gott thrstiglich (vid., Vilmar, Pastoraltheolog. Bltter, 1861, S. 110-112); according to the Vulg., et audacter provocant Deum.)<p>and this is continued in an individualizing form: him who causes Eloah to go into his hand. Seb. Schmid explains this passage in the main correctly: qui Deum in manu fert h.e. qui manum aut potentiam suam pro Deo habet et licitum sibi putat quodlibet; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> : "this his strength becomes God to him," i.e., he deifies his own power, and puts it in the place of God. But &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; signifies, in this connection with &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; (not &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;), neither to carry, nor to lead (Gesenius, who compares <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-5.htm">Psalm 74:5</a>, where, however, it signifies to cause to go into  equals  to strike into); it must be translated: he who causes Eloah to enter into his hand; from which translation it is clear that not the deification of the hand, but of that which is taken into the hand, is meant. This which is taken into the hand is not, however, an idol (Abenezra), but the sword; therefore: him who thinks after the manner of Lamech, <p>(Note: [Comp Pentateuch, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>, Clark's Foreign Theological Library. - Tr.])<p>as he takes the iron weapon of attack and defence into his hand, that he needs no other God. </body></html>
