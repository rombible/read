This is either the character Job claims for himself, or it is the supposed taunt of his friends—the righteous and the perfect a laughing-stock, or, the righteous and the perfect might be a laughing-stock. Ridicule is no test of truth or of merit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-4.htm" title="I am as one mocked of his neighbor, who calls on God, and he answers him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.">Job 12:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">I am as one mocked of his neighbour — </span><span class="greekheb">שׂחק לרעהו אהיה</span>, <span class="ital">sechok leregnehu ehjeh, </span>literally, <span class="ital">a jest to his friend, I am. </span>Thus Jeremiah complains, <span class="ital">I was a derision to all my people, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm" title="I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.">Lamentations 3:14</a>. <span class="ital">Who calleth upon God, and he answereth him — </span>This is applied by Sol. Jarchi, and the commentators in general, to Job’s neighbour or friend; intimating that such a one, addressing himself to God, received a favourable answer; when Job himself had no satisfactory return paid to his loud cries and importunate complaints. But the words are capable of a very different construction if we refer them to Job, and not to his friend, and as containing the mocking words thrown out against him: Thus, <span class="ital">He calleth </span>(say they) <span class="ital">upon God; but doth he answer him? — </span>He is loud and importunate in protesting his innocence; in clearing and vindicating himself; in appealing to the tribunal of Heaven. But to what purpose? Are his importunities and clamours received, his solemn protestations heard or admitted? His trust and confidence (he would have us to believe) are entirely on God; but is he eased of his troubles; is he delivered from his miseries? Thus the Jews mocked our Lord Jesus: “He trusted in God; (said they;) let him deliver him now, if he will have him.” “This man calleth for Elias; let us see whether Elias will come and save him.” <span class="ital">The just upright man is laughed to scorn — </span>The words have a peculiar beauty, being spoken with much religious concern and modesty; for Job does not say, <span class="ital">I, a just and upright man, am made a laughing-stock; </span>but he delivers himself in general terms; the just and upright man, &c. His meaning however is, that, notwithstanding all their hard censures and reproaches, he must still believe himself to be, through God’s grace, a just and upright man; and must say that, as such, he was derided by them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-5 Job upbraids his friends with the good opinion they had of their own wisdom compared with his. We are apt to call reproofs reproaches, and to think ourselves mocked when advised and admonished; this is our folly; yet here was colour for this charge. He suspected the true cause of their conduct to be, that they despised him who was fallen into poverty. It is the way of the world. Even the just, upright man, if he comes under a cloud, is looked upon with contempt.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am as one mocked of his neighbour - There has been considerable variety in the interpretation of this verse. The general sense is, that Job felt himself to be a mere laughing-stock for his neighbors. They treated him as if he were not worth regarding. They had no sympathy for him in his sorrows, and they showed no respect for his opinions. Dr. Good understands this and the following verses as a part of the controversy in which Job proposes to show his skill in debate, and to adduce proverbs after the manner of his friends. But it is more probably an allusion to himself, and is designed to state that he felt that he was not treated with the respect which was due to him. Much difficulty has been felt in understanding the connection. Reiske contends that <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a> has no connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>, and that <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11-12</a>, should be interposed between them. The connection seems to me to be this: Job complains that he was not treated with due deference. They had showed no respect for his understanding and rank. They had urged the most common-place topics; advanced stale and trite apothegms, as if he had never heard them; dwelt on maxims familiar even to the meanest persons; and had treated him in this manner as if he were a mere child in knowledge. Thus, to be approached with vague common-places, and with remarks such as would be used in addressing children, he regarded as insult and mockery.<p>Who calleth upon God, and he answereth him - This phrase has given occasion to great variety in the interpretation. Umbreit renders it, "I, who once called upon God, and he answered me;" that is, I, who once was a happy man, and blessed of God. Schultens renders it, "I, who call upon God," that is, for trial, "and am ready to answer him.' Rosenmuller supposes that Job has reference to the assurances of his friends, that if he would call upon God, he would answer him, and that in view of that suggestion he exclaims, "Shall a man who is a laughing-stock to his neighbor call upon God, and will he answer him!' The probable meaning is, that he had been a man who had had constant communion with God. He had been a favorite of the Almighty, for he had lent a listening ear to his supplications. It was now a thing of which he might reasonably complain, that a man who had enjoyed such manifest tokens of the divine favor, was treated with reproach and scorn. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. The unfounded accusations of Job's friends were a "mockery" of him. He alludes to Zophar's word, "mockest" (Job 11:3).<p>neighbour, who calleth, &c.&#8212;rather, "I who call upon God that he may answer me favorably" [Umbreit].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As one mocked of his neighbour, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">I am a derision</span> (the infinitive being put for a noun, as is usual both in the Hebrew and other languages) <span class="ital">to my neighbour</span>, i.e. to these three, who have pretended and would be thought to be my friends and neighbours; whom therefore such carriage doth very ill become. Instead of supporting and comforting me, they make a sport and scorn of me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who calleth upon God, and he answereth him.</span> This <span class="ital">who</span> belongs either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. To Job, who here declares his own practice in this case: When you mock me, I go to God with my complaints and prayers, and he hears me, though you will not. But this seems not to agree either with the context, or with other passages of Job; in which he constantly complains that God did not hear nor regard his prayers, nor pity and help him. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. To Job’s friends; and so this is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. An aggravation of their crime, that they should mock him who made a great profession of religion, who used duly to call upon God, and to receive answers from him, and therefore should have carried themselves more piously, and charitably, and compassionately towards their miserable brother. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. As the reason of their mockage of Job, because God, who neglected Job’s prayers, heard theirs, and gave them those mercies for which they prayed; and therefore being themselves well and at ease, they were hard-hearted towards their poor afflicted brother, as the manner of men is. This seems to suit well with the following verse. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. As all argument against their scorning or slighting of him: God hears you when you pray, therefore you should turn your mocks of me into prayers for me; and you should pity me, whom God doth not hear when I pray; and as God hears you, so you should hear and comfort me, when I pour out my complaints to you. But these words may be brought in mimetically, as being some of their scoffing words: They say of me, <span class="ital">Let him call upon God, and God will hear him</span>; for so they had suggested to Job, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-8.htm" title="I would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause:">Job 5:8</a> 8:5 11:13</span>. But this, saith Job, I take for a piece of mockery, and insulting over my miseries; for I know by sad experience, and they see the contrary, that though I call and cry again and again, yet God hath no regard to me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The just, upright man is laughed to scorn, </span> i.e. I, who, notwithstanding all their hard censures and reproaches, must and dare still own it, that through God’s grace I am a just and upright man, am derided by them.

That is, according to Sephorno, if I knew not, or denied those things you have been speaking of concerning God, his immensity, sovereignty, and wisdom, I should be derided by all my friends and acquaintance; but rather the sense is, Job instances in himself as a proof that good men are afflicted by God in this life; he was once in a very prosperous condition, when he was caressed by all, but now was fallen into such low and miserable circumstances as to be the scorn and contempt of his friends and neighbours; and even his being mocked was no small part of his afflictions; to endure cruel mockings has been the common lot of good men in all ages, and is reckoned one part of their distresses and sufferings for righteousness sake, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36</a>; and to be mocked by a neighbour, or a "friend" (g), as it may be rendered, greatly aggravates the affliction, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12</a>; which was Job's case; his friends that came to comfort him mocked at him, at least so he understood them, and interpreted what they said unto him, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-20.htm">Job 16:20</a>; and what made it still the heavier to bear, he was mocked by such a neighbour or friend, <p>who calleth upon God, and he answereth him; he was mocked at not by profane men only, but by a professor of religion, ong swept away with the flood, were cast into hell, where they have lain ever since, and will lie unto the judgment of the great day; between the place of the damned, and of the happy, in Abraham's bosom, is a great gulf, that there is no passing from one to the other, which is the immutable and unalterable decree of God, which has fixed the everlasting states of men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-26.htm">Luke 16:26</a>. <p>(r)  "super virum", Montanus, Mercerus, Bolducius;_super viro", Schmidt, Michaelis. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-15.htm">Job 12:15</a>. <p>Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up,.... Or "lays a restraint in" or "on the waters" (s); either in the ocean, as he did at the creation, when he gathered the waters that were upon the face of the earth into one place, and restrained them there, even in the decreed place he broke up for them, called the sea, and set bars and doors to keep them within bounds, whereby the places they left became dry and the dry land appeared called earth; and even such a man does not do good without sinning; only the man Christ Jesus is righteous in such sense; but then all that are made righteous, by the imputation of his righteousness to them, are perfectly justified from all things, and are become the spirits of just men made perfect and complete in him: the character here designs such who are really righteous, truly gracious, are upright in heart, sincere souls, who have the truth of grace in them, and walk uprightly; these become a prey, a laughing stock to wicked men, as Noah, Lot, and others, before the times of Job, had been, which he may have respect unto. <p>(g) "amico suo", Pagninus, Mercerus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; so Broughton.
