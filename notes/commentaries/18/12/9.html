No one of his friends makes use of the name; but Job uses it here, and shows thereby his knowledge of the covenant name.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-9.htm" title="Who knows not in all these that the hand of the LORD has worked this?">Job 12:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who knoweth not in all these — </span>Or, <span class="ital">by all these </span>brute creatures; <span class="ital">that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this — </span>That God, by his power and wisdom, hath created and ordered all that is in them, or that is done by and among them. Job meant in these verses to express his firm opinion that all animate and inanimate nature clearly bore testimony to the creating power and overruling providence of God: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-6.htm" title="You, even you, are LORD alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and you preserve them all; and the host of heaven worships you.">Nehemiah 9:6</a>. This is the only time that we meet with the name Jehovah in all the discourses between Job and his friends.

The most audacious robbers, oppressors, and impious wretches, often prosper. Yet this is not by fortune or chance; the Lord orders these things. Worldly prosperity is of small value in his sight: he has better things for his children. Job resolves all into the absolute proprietorship which God has in all the creatures. He demands from his friends liberty to judge of what they had said; he appeals to any fair judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who knoweth not in all these - Who cannot see in all these the proofs of the same divine and sovereign agency? Who cannot see the hand of the same God and the same great principles of administration? The meaning of Job is, that the position which he defends is so plain, that it may be learned from the very earth and the lowest orders of animals which God has made.<p>That the hand of the Lord hath wrought this - In this place the original word is &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h. On the meaning of the word see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>. The Chaldee also renders it here &#1497;&#1492;  ya&#770;hh. It is remarkable that this is the only place where the name yahweh occurs in poetical parts of the book of Job, in the printed editions. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>, yahweh is found in some manuscripts, though the word "Adonai" is in the printed copies. Eichhorn, Einleit. section 644, Note. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>, the word yahweh, though found in the printed editions, is missing in nine ancient manuscripts. Dr. John P. Wilson on the "Hope of Immortality," p. 57. The word yahweh constantly occurs in the historical parts of the book. On the argument derived from this, in regard to the antiquity of the Book of Job, see the introduction, Section 4. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. In all these cases, says Job, the agency must be referred to Jehovah, though they may seem to man to imply imperfection (Job 12:6; 9:24). This is the only undisputed passage of the poetical part in which the name "Jehovah" occurs; in the historical parts it occurs frequently.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In all these, </span> or, <span class="ital">by all these</span>, brute creatures, that God by his power and wisdom hath created and ordered all this which is in them, or is done by and among them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who knoweth not in all these,....

The writer probably regards the name as unfamiliar, if not unknown, to Job's neighbours, and therefore as avoided by him in his discussions with them. But here, for once, he forgets to be consistent with himself. Outside Scripture, the name is first found on the Moabite Stone (about  <span class="date">B.C. 890</span>), where it designates the God worshipped by the Israelites (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 11. p. 166, 1. 18). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  The Job began, and said:<p>  2  Truly then ye are the people,<p>And wisdom shall die with you!<p>  3  I also have a heart as well as you;<p>I do not stand behind you;<p>And to whom should not such things be known?<p>The admission, which is strengthened by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;, truly then (distinct from &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for truly, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-4.htm">Job 36:4</a>, similar to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, behold indeed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-4.htm">Psalm 128:4</a>), is intended as irony: ye are not merely single individuals, but the people  equals  race of men (&#1506;&#1501;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>), so that all human understanding is confined to you, and there is none other to be found; and when once you die, it will seem to have died out.
