There is need to be thoroughly convinced and humbled, to prepare us for remarkable deliverances. After God had shown Job, by his manifest ignorance of the works of nature, how unable he was to judge of the methods and designs of Providence, he puts a convincing question to him; Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? Now Job began to melt into godly sorrow: when his friends reasoned with him, he did not yield; but the voice of the Lord is powerful. When the Spirit of truth is come, he shall convince. Job yields himself to the grace of God. He owns himself an offender, and has nothing to say to justify himself. He is now sensible that he has sinned; and therefore he calls himself vile. Repentance changes men's opinion of themselves. Job is now convinced of his error. Those who are truly sensible of their own sinfulness and vileness, dare not justify themselves before God. He perceived that he was a poor, mean, foolish, and sinful creature, who ought not to have uttered one word against the Divine conduct. One glimpse of God's holy nature would appal the stoutest rebel. How, then will the wicked bear the sight of his glory at the day of judgment? But when we see this glory revealed in Jesus Christ, we shall be humbled without being terrified; self-abasement agrees with filial love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, I am vile: what shall I answer thee? - "Instead of being able to argue my cause, and to vindicate myself as I had expected, I now see that I am guilty, and I have nothing to say." He had argued boldly with his friends. He had, before them, maintained his innocence of the charges which they brought against him, and had supposed that he would be able to maintain the same argument before God. But when the opportunity was given, he felt that he was a poor, weak man; a guilty and miserable offender. It is a very different thing to maintain our cause before God, from what it is to maintain it before people; and though we may attempt to vindicate our own righteousness when we argue with our fellow-creatures, yet when we come to maintain it before God we shall be dumb. On earth, people vindicate themselves; what will they do when they come to stand before God in the judgment?<p>I will lay mine hand upon my mouth - An expression of silence. Catlin, in his account of the Mandan Indians, says that this is a common custom with them when anything wonderful occurs. Some of them laid their hands on their mouths and remained in this posture by the hour, as an expression of astonishment at the wonders produced by the brush in the art of painting; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-5.htm">Job 21:5</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29-9.htm">Job 29:9</a>, note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. I am (too) vile (to reply). It is a very different thing to vindicate ourselves before God, from what it is before men. Job could do the latter, not the former.<p>lay &#8230; hand &#8230; upon &#8230; mouth&#8212;I have no plea to offer (Job 21:5; Jud 18:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I am vile, </span> what am I, a mean and contemptible creature that should presume to contend with my Maker and Judge?

Or "light" (a); which may have respect either to his words and arguments, which he thought had force in them, but now he saw they had none; or to his works and actions, the integrity of his life, and the uprightness of his ways, which he imagined were weighty and of great importance, but now being weighed in the balances of justice were found wanting; or it may refer to his original meanness and distance from God, being dust and ashes, and nothing in comparison of him; and so the Septuagint version is, "I am nothing"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a>; or rather to the original vileness and sinfulness of his nature he had now a sight of, and saw how he had been breaking forth in unbecoming expressions concerning God and his providence: the nature of man is exceeding vile and sinful; his heart desperately wicked; his thoughts, and the imaginations of them, evil, and that continually; his mind and conscience are defiled; his affections inordinate, and his understanding and will sadly depraved; he is vile in soul and body; of all which an enlightened man is convinced, and will acknowledge; <p>what shall I answer thee? I am not able to answer thee, who am but dust and ashes; what more can I say than to acknowledge my levity, vanity, and vileness? he that talked so big, and in such a blustering manner of answering God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-22.htm">Job 13:22</a>; now has nothing to say for himself; <p>I will lay mine hand upon my mouth; impose silence upon himself, and as it were lay a restraint upon himself from speaking: it looks as if there were some workings in Job's heart; he thought he could say something, and make some reply, but durst not, for fear of offending yet more and more, and therefore curbed it in; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1</a>. <p>(a) "levis sum", Cocceius, Michaelis; "leviter locutus sum", V.

Arab. ns&#803;s&#803;, to rise, struggle forwards, and Arab. nd&#803;d&#803;, to raise the wings for flight). The Hiph. &#1497;&#1488;&#1489;&#1512;- (jussive form in the question, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>) might signify: to get feathers, plumescere (Targ., Jer.), but that gives a tame question; wherefore Gregory understands the plumescit of the Vulgate of moulting, for which purpose the hawk seeks the sunny side. But &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; alone, by itself, cannot signify "to get new feathers;" moreover, an annual moulting is common to all birds, and prominence is alone given to the new feathering of the eagle in the Old Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a> (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;).<p>(Note: Less unfavourable to this rendering is the following, that &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; signifies the long feathers, and &#1488;&#1489;&#1512; the wing that is composed of them (perhaps, since the Talm. &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; signifies wings and limbs, artus, from &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;  equals  &#1492;&#1489;&#1512;, Arab. hbr, to divide, furnish with joints), although &#1504;&#1493;&#1510;&#1492; (from &#1504;&#1510;&#1492;, to fly) is the more general designation of the feathers of birds.)<p>Thus, then, the point of the question will lie in &#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503;: the hawk is a bird of passage, God has endowed it with instinct to migrate to the south as the winter season is approaching.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a> the circle of the native figures taken from animal life, which began with the lion, the king of quadrupeds, is now closed with the eagle, the king of birds. It is called &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, Arab. nsr, vellere; as also vultur (by virtue of a strong power of assimilation  equals  vultor) is derived from vellere, - a common name of the golden eagle, the lamb's vulture, the carrion-kite (Cathartes percnopterus), and indeed also of other kinds of kites and falcons. There is nothing to prevent our understanding the eagle &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, viz., the golden eagle (Aquila chrysatos), in the present passage; for even to this, corpses, though not already putrified, are a welcome prey. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a> we must translate either: and is it at thy command that ... ? or: is it so that (as in &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;) at thy command ... ? The former is more natural here. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-28.htm">Job 39:28</a>, signifies prop. specula (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to spy); then, however, as Arab. masa&#770;d (referred by the original lexicons to masada), the high hill, and the mountain-top.
