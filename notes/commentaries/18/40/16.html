Behemoth signifies beasts. Most understand it of an animal well known in Egypt, called the river-horse, or hippopotamus. This vast animal is noticed as an argument to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created this vast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whatever strength this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. He that made the soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make the sword of justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it. Every godly man has spiritual weapons, the whole armour of God, to resist, yea, to overcome the tempter, that his never-dying soul may be safe, whatever becomes of his frail flesh and mortal body.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lo now, his strength is in his loins - The inspection of the figure of the hippopotamus will show the accuracy of this. The strength of the elephant is in the neck; of the lion in the paw; of the horse and ox in the shoulders; but the principal power of the river-horse is in the loins; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a>. This passage is one that proves that the elephant cannot be referred to.<p>And his force is in the navel of his belly - The word which is here rendered "navel" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;  sha&#770;r&#305;&#770;yr) means properly "firm, hard, tough," and in the plural form, which occurs here, means the "firm," or "tough" parts of the belly. It is not used to denote the "navel" in any place in the Bible, and should not have been so rendered here. The reference is to the muscles and tendons of this part of the body, and perhaps particularly to the fact that the hippopotamus, by crawling so much on his belly among the stones of the stream or on land, acquires a special hardness or strength in those parts of the body. This clearly proves that the elephant is not intended. In that animal, this is the most tender part of the body. Pliny and Solinus both remark that the elephant has a thick, hard skin on the back, but that the skin of the belly is soft and tender. Pliny says ("Hist. Nat." Lib. viii. c. 20), that the rhinoceros, when about to attack an elephant, "seeks his belly, as if he knew that that was the most tender part." So Aelian, "Hist." Lib. xvii. c. 44; see Bochart, as above. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. navel&#8212;rather, "muscles" of his belly; the weakest point of the elephant, therefore it is not meant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He hath strength answerable to his bulk, but this strength by God’s wise and merciful providence is not an offensive strength, consisting in or put forth by horns or claws, as it is in ravenous creatures; but only defensive, and seated in his loins, as it is in other creatures, whereby he is rendered more serviceable to men by the carrying of vast burdens. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His force is in the navel of his belly; </span> which though in the elephant it be weaker than his loins, whence the rhinoceros fighting with him aims at that part; yet hath a more than ordinary strength in it, as appears by the binding of the heaviest burdens under and about it. This also agrees to the hippopotamus in an eminent degree, whose whole skin is noted by ancient writers to be harder than any other creature’s, and almost impenetrable. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Lo now, his strength is in his loins,.... The strength of the elephant is well known, being able to carry a castle on its back, with a number of men therein; but what follows does not seem so well to agree with it; <p>and his force is in the navel of his belly; since the belly of the elephant is very tender; by means of which the rhinoceros, its enemy, in its fight with it, has the advantage of it, by getting under its belly, and ripping it up with its horn (s). In like manner Eleazar the Jew killed one of the elephants of Antiochus, by getting between its legs, and thrusting his sword into its navel (t); which fell and killed him with the weight of it. On the other hand, the "river horse" is covered with a skin all over, the hardest and strongest of all creatures (u), as not to be pierced with spears or arrows (w); and of it dried were made helmets, shields, spears, and polished darts (x). That which Monsieur Thevenot (y) saw had several shot fired at it before it fell, for the bullets hardly pierced through its skin. We made several shot at him, says another traveller (z), but to no purpose; for they would glance from him as from a wall. And indeed the elephant is said to have such a hard scaly skin as to resist the spear (a): and Pliny (b), though he speaks of the hide of the river horse being so thick that spears are made of it; yet of the hide of the elephant, as having targets made of that, which are impenetrable. <p>(s) Aelian. de Amimal. l. 17. c. 44.

The strength of the hippopotamus is its principal characteristic. Weighing often two thousand kilogrammes, and of a short thick make, when roused to anger it has a force which is irresistible. In the water it upsets large beats; on land it forces its way through dense thickets and fences of all kinds. The loins are especially strong, being deep, broad, and immensely muscular<span class="cmt_word">.

It is a plural form, and therefore cannot designate a single object, like the navel. The root seems to be the Syriac <span class="accented">serir</span> "firm," whence Schultens proposes to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> by <span class="accented">firmitates.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10  Deck thyself then with pomp and dignity,<p>And in glory and majesty clothe thyself!<p>11  Let the overflowings of thy wrath pour forth,<p>And behold all pride, and abase it!<p>12  Behold all pride, bring it low,<p>And cast down the evil-doers in their place;<p>13  Hide them in the dust together,<p>Bind their faces in secret:<p>14  Then I also will praise thee,<p>That thy right hand obtaineth thee help.<p>He is for once to put on the robes of the King of kings (&#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, comp. &#1506;&#1496;&#1495;, to wrap round, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>), and send forth his wrath over pride and evil-doing, for their complete removal. &#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509;, effundere, diffundere, as Arab. afa&#770;da, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11</a>. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, or rather, according to the reading of Ben-Ascher, &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; ,rehcsA, in its prop. signif. oversteppings, i.e., overflowings.
