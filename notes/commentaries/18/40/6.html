And those who are truly convinced of sin, yet need to be more thoroughly convinced and more humbled. No doubt God, and he only, has power to humble and bring down proud men; he has wisdom to know when and how to do it, and it is not for us to teach him how to govern the world. Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace, much less rescuing us from his justice; and therefore into his hand we must commit ourselves. The renewal of a believer proceeds in the same way of conviction, humbling, and watchfulness against remaining sin, as his first conversion. When convinced of many evils in our conduct, we still need convincing of many more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>.

Some think that the whirlwind ceased while the Lord spake the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>; which encouraged Job to make the answer he did; but others are of opinion that it continued, and now increased, and was more boisterous than before. The Targum calls it the whirlwind of tribulation: comfort does not always follow immediately on first convictions; Job, though humbled, was not yet humbled enough: God will have a fuller confession of sin from him: it was not sufficient to say he was vile, he must declare his sorrow for his sin, his abhorrence of it, and of himself for it, and his repentance of it; and that he had said things of God he ought not to have said, and which he understood not; and though he had said he would answer no more, God will make him say more, and therefore continued the whirlwind, and to speak out of it; for he had more to say to him, and give him further proof of his power to his full conviction; <p>and said; as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/40.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">the whirlwind</span>] As before, <span class="bld">the storm</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-6.htm" title="Then answered the LORD to Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 40:6</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-6.htm" title="Why I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.">Job 42:6</a>. The Lord’s Second Answer to Job out of the Storm<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Shall Man charge God with unrighteousness in His Rule of the World?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All that the first speech of the Lord touched upon was the presumption of a mortal man desiring to contend with the Almighty. The display from Creation of that which God is had the desired effect on Job’s mind: he is abased, and will no more contend with the Almighty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But Job had not only presumed to contend with God, he had charged Him with unrighteousness in His rule of the world and in His treatment of himself.

The argument falls under three heads - Can Job cope with God in his general providence (vers? 6-14)? can he even cope with two of God's creatures - with <span class="accented">behemoth</span> or the hippopotamus (vers. 15-24); with <span class="accented">leviathan</span>, or the crocodile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-34</a>)? <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>).

Arab. ns&#803;s&#803;, to rise, struggle forwards, and Arab. nd&#803;d&#803;, to raise the wings for flight). The Hiph. &#1497;&#1488;&#1489;&#1512;- (jussive form in the question, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>) might signify: to get feathers, plumescere (Targ., Jer.), but that gives a tame question; wherefore Gregory understands the plumescit of the Vulgate of moulting, for which purpose the hawk seeks the sunny side. But &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; alone, by itself, cannot signify "to get new feathers;" moreover, an annual moulting is common to all birds, and prominence is alone given to the new feathering of the eagle in the Old Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a> (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;).<p>(Note: Less unfavourable to this rendering is the following, that &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; signifies the long feathers, and &#1488;&#1489;&#1512; the wing that is composed of them (perhaps, since the Talm. &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; signifies wings and limbs, artus, from &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;  equals  &#1492;&#1489;&#1512;, Arab. hbr, to divide, furnish with joints), although &#1504;&#1493;&#1510;&#1492; (from &#1504;&#1510;&#1492;, to fly) is the more general designation of the feathers of birds.)<p>Thus, then, the point of the question will lie in &#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503;: the hawk is a bird of passage, God has endowed it with instinct to migrate to the south as the winter season is approaching.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a> the circle of the native figures taken from animal life, which began with the lion, the king of quadrupeds, is now closed with the eagle, the king of birds. It is called &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, Arab. nsr, vellere; as also vultur (by virtue of a strong power of assimilation  equals  vultor) is derived from vellere, - a common name of the golden eagle, the lamb's vulture, the carrion-kite (Cathartes percnopterus), and indeed also of other kinds of kites and falcons. There is nothing to prevent our understanding the eagle &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, viz., the golden eagle (Aquila chrysatos), in the present passage; for even to this, corpses, though not already putrified, are a welcome prey. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a> we must translate either: and is it at thy command that ... ? or: is it so that (as in &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;) at thy command ... ? The former is more natural here. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-28.htm">Job 39:28</a>, signifies prop. specula (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to spy); then, however, as Arab. masa&#770;d (referred by the original lexicons to masada), the high hill, and the mountain-top.
