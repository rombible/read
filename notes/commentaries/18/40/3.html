Vain, therefore, are the excuses which some interpreters make for Job, as if he were faultless in his foregoing speeches, when both God charges him with blame therein, and Job himself confesses that he was blameable.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/40.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>40:1-5 Communion with the Lord effectually convinces and humbles a saint, and makes him glad to part with his most beloved sins. There is need to be thoroughly convinced and humbled, to prepare us for remarkable deliverances. After God had shown Job, by his manifest ignorance of the works of nature, how unable he was to judge of the methods and designs of Providence, he puts a convincing question to him; Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? Now Job began to melt into godly sorrow: when his friends reasoned with him, he did not yield; but the voice of the Lord is powerful. When the Spirit of truth is come, he shall convince. Job yields himself to the grace of God. He owns himself an offender, and has nothing to say to justify himself. He is now sensible that he has sinned; and therefore he calls himself vile. Repentance changes men's opinion of themselves. Job is now convinced of his error. Those who are truly sensible of their own sinfulness and vileness, dare not justify themselves before God. He perceived that he was a poor, mean, foolish, and sinful creature, who ought not to have uttered one word against the Divine conduct. One glimpse of God's holy nature would appal the stoutest rebel. How, then will the wicked bear the sight of his glory at the day of judgment? But when we see this glory revealed in Jesus Christ, we shall be humbled without being terrified; self-abasement agrees with filial love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall he that contendeth with the A mighty instruct him? - Gesenius renders this, "Contending shall the reprover of God contend with the Almighty?" Prof. Lee, "Shall one by contending with the Almighty correct this?" On the grammatical construction, see Gesenius on the word &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;  yisso&#770;r, and Rosenmuller and Lee, in loc. The meaning seems to be this: "Will he who would enter into a controversy with the Almighty now presume to instruct him? He that was so desirous of arguing his cause with God, will he now answer?" All the language used here is taken from courts, and is such as I have had frequent occasion to explain in these notes. The reference is to the fact that Job had so often expressed a wish to carry his cause, as before a judicial tribunal, directly up to God. He had felt that if he could get it there, he could so argue it as to secure a verdict in his favor; that he could set arguments before the Almighty which would secure a reversal of the fearful sentence which had gone out against him, and which had caused him to be held as a guilty man. God now asks whether he who had been so anxious to have a legal argument, and to carry his cause himself before God - a man disposed to litigation before God (&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;  ru&#770;b) - was still of the same mind, and felt himself qualified to take upon himself the office of an instructor, a corrector, an admonisher (&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;  yisso&#770;r) of God? He had the opportunity now, and God here paused, after the sublime exhibition of his majesty and power in the previous chapters, to give him an opportunity, as he wished, to carry his cause directly before him. The result is stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-3.htm">Job 40:3-4</a>. Job had now nothing to say.<p>He that reproveth God - Or rather, "He that is disposed to carry his cause before God," as Job had often expressed a wish to do. The word used here (&#1497;&#1499;&#1495;  ya&#770;kach) is often employed, especially in the Hiphil, in a "forensic sense," and means "to argue, to show, to prove" anything; then "to argue down, to confute, to convict;" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-5.htm">Job 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-12.htm">Proverbs 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a>. It is evidently used in that sense here - a Hiphil participle &#1502;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;  mo&#770;kiyach - and refers, not to any man in general who reproves God, but to Job in particular, as having expressed a wish to carry his cause before him, and to argue it there.<p>Let him answer it - Or rather, "Let him answer him." That is, Is he now ready to answer? There is now an opportunity for him to carry his cause, as he wished, directly before God. Is he ready to embrace the opportunity, and to answer now what the Almighty has said? This does not mean, then, as the common version would seem to imply, that the man who reproves God must be held responsible for it, but that Job, who had expressed the wish to carry his cause before God, had now an opportunity to do so. That this is the meaning, is apparent from the next verses, where Job says that he was confounded, and had nothing to say. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Arab. ns&#803;s&#803;, to rise, struggle forwards, and Arab. nd&#803;d&#803;, to raise the wings for flight). The Hiph. &#1497;&#1488;&#1489;&#1512;- (jussive form in the question, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>) might signify: to get feathers, plumescere (Targ., Jer.), but that gives a tame question; wherefore Gregory understands the plumescit of the Vulgate of moulting, for which purpose the hawk seeks the sunny side. But &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; alone, by itself, cannot signify "to get new feathers;" moreover, an annual moulting is common to all birds, and prominence is alone given to the new feathering of the eagle in the Old Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a> (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;).<p>(Note: Less unfavourable to this rendering is the following, that &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; signifies the long feathers, and &#1488;&#1489;&#1512; the wing that is composed of them (perhaps, since the Talm. &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; signifies wings and limbs, artus, from &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;  equals  &#1492;&#1489;&#1512;, Arab. hbr, to divide, furnish with joints), although &#1504;&#1493;&#1510;&#1492; (from &#1504;&#1510;&#1492;, to fly) is the more general designation of the feathers of birds.)<p>Thus, then, the point of the question will lie in &#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503;: the hawk is a bird of passage, God has endowed it with instinct to migrate to the south as the winter season is approaching.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a> the circle of the native figures taken from animal life, which began with the lion, the king of quadrupeds, is now closed with the eagle, the king of birds. It is called &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, Arab. nsr, vellere; as also vultur (by virtue of a strong power of assimilation  equals  vultor) is derived from vellere, - a common name of the golden eagle, the lamb's vulture, the carrion-kite (Cathartes percnopterus), and indeed also of other kinds of kites and falcons. There is nothing to prevent our understanding the eagle &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, viz., the golden eagle (Aquila chrysatos), in the present passage; for even to this, corpses, though not already putrified, are a welcome prey. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a> we must translate either: and is it at thy command that ... ? or: is it so that (as in &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;) at thy command ... ? The former is more natural here. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-28.htm">Job 39:28</a>, signifies prop. specula (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to spy); then, however, as Arab. masa&#770;d (referred by the original lexicons to masada), the high hill, and the mountain-top.
