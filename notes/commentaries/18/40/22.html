Behemoth signifies beasts. Most understand it of an animal well known in Egypt, called the river-horse, or hippopotamus. This vast animal is noticed as an argument to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created this vast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whatever strength this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. He that made the soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make the sword of justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it. Every godly man has spiritual weapons, the whole armour of God, to resist, yea, to overcome the tempter, that his never-dying soul may be safe, whatever becomes of his frail flesh and mortal body.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The shady trees - Probably the "lote-trees;" see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-21.htm">Job 40:21</a>.

And this seems to be the chief argument by which the learned Bochart proves this to be meant of the hippopotamus, whose constant residence is in or near the river of Nilus, or the willows that grow by it. But it is well alleged by our learned and judicious Caryl, that this word <span class="ital">Naal</span> is never used to express Nilus when it is put by itself, as here it is, but only where the word Egypt is added to it, as it is in all the places which Bochart produceth.

It is, as Bochart has first of all shown, the so-called river or Nile horse, Hippopotamus amphibius (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1490;&#1489;, as emblem of Egypt, which extends its power, and still is active in the interest of others), found in the rivers of Africa, but no longer found in the Nile, which is not inappropriately called a horse; the Arab. water-hog is better, Italian bomarino, Eng. sea-cow ?, like the Egyptian p-ehe-mau. The change of p and b in the exchange of Egyptian and Semitic words occurs also elsewhere, e.g., pug' and &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, harpu and &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;), Apriu and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (according to Lauth). Nevertheless p-ehe-mau (not mau-t, for what should the post-positive fem. art. do here?) is first of all only the &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; translated back again into the Egyptian by Jablonsky; an instance in favour of this is still wanting. In Hieroglyph the Nile-horse is called apet; it was honoured as divine. Brugsch dwelt in Thebes in the temple of the Apet.<p>(Note: In the astronomical representations the hippopotamus is in the neighbourhood of the North Pole in the place of the dragon of the present day, and bears the name of hes-mut, in which mut  equals  t. mau, "the mother." Hes however is obscure; Birch explains it by: raging.)<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a> &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; signifies nothing but "with thee," so that thou hast it before thee. This water-ox eats &#1495;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, green grass, like an ox. That it prefers to plunder the produce of the fields - in Arab. chad&#305;&#770;r signifies, in particular, green barley - is accordingly self-evident. Nevertheless, it has gigantic strength, viz., in its plump loins and in the sinews (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, properly the firm constituent parts,<p>(Note: Staring from its primary signification (made firm, fast), Arab. sr&#305;&#770;r, &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; can signify e.g., also things put together from wood: a throne, a hand-barrow, bedstead and cradle, metaphor. the foundation. Wetzst. otherwise: "The &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1489;&#1496;&#1503; are not the sinews and muscles, still less 'the private parts' of others, but the four bearers of the animal body  equals  arka&#770;n el-batn, viz., the bones of the &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a>, together with the two shoulder-blades. The Arab. sar&#305;&#770;r is that on which a thing is supported or rests, on which it stands firmly, or moves about. Neshwn (i. 280) says: &#8219;sar&#305;&#770;r is the substratum on which a thing rests,' and the sar&#305;&#770;r er-ra's, says the same, is the place where the head rests upon the nape of the neck.

Arab. mud&#803;t&#803;aja&#8219;, "the support of a thing.")<p>therefore: ligaments and muscles) of its clumsy belly. The brush of a tail, short in comparison with the monster itself, is compared to a cedar (a branch of it), ratione glabritiei, rotunditatis, spissitudinis et firmitatis (Bochart); since the beast is in general almost without hair, it looks like a stiff, naked bone, and yet it can bend it like an elastic cedar branch; &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; is Hebraeo-Arab., h&#803;fd&#803;<p>continued...</body></html>
