And those who are truly convinced of sin, yet need to be more thoroughly convinced and more humbled. No doubt God, and he only, has power to humble and bring down proud men; he has wisdom to know when and how to do it, and it is not for us to teach him how to govern the world. Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace, much less rescuing us from his justice; and therefore into his hand we must commit ourselves. The renewal of a believer proceeds in the same way of conviction, humbling, and watchfulness against remaining sin, as his first conversion. When convinced of many evils in our conduct, we still need convincing of many more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hide them in the dust together; - compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-10.htm">Isaiah 2:10</a>. The meaning seems to be, that God had power to prostrate the wicked in the dust of the earth, and he calls upon Job to show his power by doing the same thing.<p>And bind their faces in secret - The word "faces" here is probably used (like the Greek &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;  priso&#772;pa to denote "persons." The phrase" to bind them," is expressive of having them under control or subjection; and the phrase "in secret" may refer to some secret or safe place - as a dungeon or prison. The meaning of the whole is, that God had power to restrain and control the haughty and the wicked, and he appeals to Job to do the same. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

Either in the dust of death, that they may be seen no more in this world, in the same place and circumstances where they showed their pride and haughtiness; or in the dust of the grave, and let them have an inglorious burial, like that of malefactors thrown into some common pit together; as, when multitudes are slain in battle, a large pit is dug, and the bodies are cast in together without any order or decency; or it may be rendered "alike" (b), let them be treated equally alike, no preference given to one above another; <p>and bind their faces in secret; alluding, as it is thought, to malefactors when condemned and about to be executed, whose faces are then covered, as Haman's was, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-8.htm">Esther 7:8</a>; or to the dead when buried, whose faces are bound with napkins, as Lazarus's was, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-44.htm">John 11:44</a>; the meaning of all these expressions is, that Job would abase and destroy, if he could, every proud man he met with, as God does, in the course of his providence, sooner or later. There had been instances of divine power in this way before, or in the times of Job, which might come to his knowledge; as the casting down of the proud angels out of heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>; and of casting proud Adam out of paradise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; the drowning the proud giants of the old world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-23.htm">Genesis 7:23</a>; and of dispersing the proud builders of Babel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-8.htm">Genesis 11:8</a>; and of destroying Sodom and Gomorrah by fire, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>, one of whose reigning sins was pride, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>; and of drowning proud Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>, which last seems to have been done much about the time <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/54.htm">Job 54</a>ed. <p>(b) "pariter", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hide them in the dust together; <i>and</i> bind <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> their faces in secret.</span><p>(c) Cause them to die if you can.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/40.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">bind their faces in secret</span>] lit. <span class="ital">bind up their faces in the hidden place</span>, that is, shut them up in the darkness of the prison-house of Death.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Gird up thy loins manfully:<p>I will question thee, and do thou answer me!<p>  8  Wilt thou altogether annul my right,<p>Condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?<p>  9  And hast thou then an arm like God,<p>And canst thou with the voice thunder like Him?<p>The question with &#1492;&#1488;&#1507; stands to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a> in the relation of a climax: Job contended not alone with God, which is in itself wrong, let it be whatsoever it may; he went so far as to lose sight of the divine justice in the government of the world, and in order not to be obliged to give up his own righteousness, so far as to doubt the divine. &#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-9.htm">Job 40:9</a>, is also interrogative, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-13.htm">Job 39:13</a>, not expressive of a wish, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-16.htm">Job 34:16</a>.
