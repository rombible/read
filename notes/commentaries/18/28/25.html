One day's events, and one man's affairs, have such reference to, and so hang one upon another, that He only, to whom all is open, and who sees the whole at one view, can rightly judge of every part. But the knowledge of God's revealed will is within our reach, and will do us good. Let man look upon this as his wisdom, To fear the Lord, and to depart from evil. Let him learn that, and he is learned enough. Where is this wisdom to be found? The treasures of it are hid in Christ, revealed by the word, received by faith, through the Holy Ghost. It will not feed pride or vanity, or amuse our vain curiosity. It teaches and encourages sinners to fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, in the exercise of repentance and faith, without desiring to solve all difficulties about the events of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To make the weight for the winds - That is, to weigh the winds and to measure the waters - things that it would seem most difficult to do. The idea here seems to be, that God had made all things by measure and by rule. Even the winds - so fleeting and imponderable - he had adjusted and balanced in the most exact manner, as if he had "weighed" them when he made them. The air has "weight," but it is not probable that this fact was known in the time of Job, or that he adverted to it here. It is rather the idea suggested above, that the God who had formed everything by exact rule. and who had power to govern the winds in the most exact manner, must be qualified to impart wisdom.<p>And he weigheth the waters - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>. The word rendered "weigheth" in this place (&#1514;&#1499;&#1503;  ta&#770;kan) means either to "weigh," or to "measure," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>. As the "measure" here is mentioned, it rather means probably to adjust, to apportion, than to weigh. The waters are dealt out by measure; the winds are weighed. The sense is, that though the waters of the ocean are so vast, yet God has adjusted them all with infinite skill, as if he had dealt them out by measure; and having done this, he is qualified to explain to man the reason of his doings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. God has adjusted the weight of the winds, so seemingly imponderable, lest, if too weighty, or too light, injury should be caused. He measureth out the waters, fixing their bounds, with wisdom as His counsellor (Pr 8:27-31; Isa 40:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To make the weight for the winds; </span> which of themselves are most light, and without any weight, and inconstant, and such as no creature can order or govern them: but God manageth them all by weight, appointing to every wind that blows its season, its proportion, its bounds and limits, when, and where, and how much, and how long each wind shall blow, and for what ends; whether for mercy, as to refresh men in hot seasons with its gentle gales, to cherish the fruits of the earth, to waft ships on the sea to their desired havens, &c.; or whether for judgment, as to corrupt the air, and thereby the bodies of men, and fruits of the earth, to blow down houses upon their inhabitants, as he was pleased to deal with my poor unhappy children. He only doth all these things, and he only knows why he doth them. He instanceth but in some few of God’s works, and those which seem to be most trivial, and casual, and uncertain, that thereby he might more strongly imply and prove that God doth the same in other things which are more considerable, and are managed by more constant causes and certain methods; that he doth all things in the most exact order, and weight, and measure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He weigheth:</span> but it seems a very improper speech, <span class="ital">to weigh</span> things by measure; and therefore this word may more fitly be otherwise rendered, <span class="ital">he examineth</span>, or <span class="ital">disposeth</span>, or <span class="ital">fitteth</span>, or <span class="ital">directeth</span>, for so this verb is elsewhere used, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm" title="Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.">1 Samuel 2:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm" title="The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it.

He indeed makes the wind itself, holds it in his fists, and brings it forth out of his treasures, and lets it go, or restrains it, at his pleasure; he gives it an inclination to this or that or the other point of the heavens, and a force to blow with, greater or lesser, as he pleases, either for the good and benefit of men, or for the punishment of them; he raises the stormy wind, which fulfils his word and his will; and he makes it subside and become a calm when he thinks fit; he can make it heavier or lighter, add to or take from its weight, so that it becomes more or less pressing on bodies it meets with; he can make a rough wind, and stay that in the day of his east wind; he can make the rain in some sense a weight to it; he can wet its wings with it, and bear it down and cause it to rest and be still; and he that knows from whence it comes, and whither it goes, though we do not, being wholly under his direction, must know the way and place of wisdom: <p>and he weigheth the waters by measure; or, "in a measure" (k); in the hollow of his hand, where he poises them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>; some, because there is a seeming impropriety in weighing by, or with a measure, render it "out of a measure" (l) Mr. Broughton translates the words, "and held the waters in a measure"; in his hand, as before, or in the sea; weight and measure being both applied to the waters, may denote the perfect and exact knowledge God has of them, and of his great and diligent concern in Providence about them, he ordering and disposing of them according to his will; and which is greatly the sense of the word used for weighing; and so the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"the waters he prepares (orders or disposes of) by measure.'' <p>These waters, as they seem to be distinguished from rain in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-26.htm">Job 28:26</a>, may design the waters of the sea and rivers; with these the earth at first was covered, which being ordered off of it, and a place provided for them, they were gathered into it, and measured and bounded in it by shores and sand, that they might not overflow the earth; which is a wonderful instance of the providence of God, in weighing and measuring the waters; of which also there was a singular instance at the general deluge, when the windows of heaven were opened, and the fountains of the great deep broke up, which overflowed the whole earth, and the highest mountains in it; and after a time went off at the command of God, and the earth was dry as before: the tides, the ebbing and flowing of the sea, and the flux and reflux of rivers, from and to the same place, are surprising things, and wholly owing to the power and providence of God; the causes and reasons of which are unknown to us, but are well known to him, who weighs and measures the waters, which flow in a regular course; and who therefore must know the way and place of wisdom and understanding. <p>(k) "in mensura", V.

The idea is of course that God weighed the winds themselves, i. e. defined their bulk exactly, not that, in modern language, he gave to each its weight or pressure, though the sense is little different.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he weigheth the waters by measure</span>] Or, <span class="bld">and he meted out the waters by measure</span>.

The “winds” and “waters” are examples, taken to represent all, of the agencies and forces of creation. These were and continue all weighed and measured, adjusted and directed by God. The second half of the verse explains the first. In the first half it is not God’s abstract omniscience that is referred to, but His universal oversight as Creator; and the sense of the whole verse, which supports the assertion that God has Wisdom (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-23.htm" title="God understands the way thereof, and he knows the place thereof.">Job 28:23</a></span>), is not that God <span class="ital">must be</span> in possession of Wisdom in order to be Creator, which without Wisdom He could not be, but rather that His being Creator enables us to understand how Wisdom is or comes to be in His possession.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Wisdom in this passage, as in other parts of Scripture where it is spoken of, is properly the <span class="ital">idea</span> or conception lying behind or under the fixed order of the universe, the world-plan. This fixed order itself with all its phenomena and occurrences is nothing but God fulfilling Himself in many ways, but these ways may be reduced to one conception, and this is Wisdom, which is thus conceived as a thing having an objective existence of its own. Naturally such an objective thing is apt to be personified and may be “seen,” “established,” “searched out” and the like. In the same way the question may be put, Where is Wisdom to be found? and the answer given that it can be found nowhere. This question and answer merely mean that man cannot attain to <span class="ital">intellectual</span> apprehension of the idea of the universe, nor understand the principle underlying the phenomena and events of the world and human life.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To make the weight for the winds.</span> God by his wisdom gives to winds their exactly fitting degree of force and violence, so that they perform the work in the world which they were intended to perform, and which would not be performed, were they either of a less or of a greater intensity. <span class="cmt_word">And he weigheth the waters by measure</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>, "Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with a span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?").

Symm. indeed translates crystal, and in fact the ancient languages have common names for glass and crystal; but the crystal is here called &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which signifies prop., like the Arab. 'gibs, ice; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; also signifies prop. ice, and this only in Homer, then crystal, exactly as the cognate &#1511;&#1512;&#1495; unites both significations in itself. The reason of this homonymy lies deeper than in the outward similarity, - the ancients really thought the crystal was a product of the cold; Pliny, xxxvii. 2, 9, says: non alibi certe reperitur quam ubi maxume hibernae nives rigent, glaciemque esse certum est, unde nomen Graeci dedere. The Targ. translates &#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; by &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, certainly in the sense of the Arabico-Persic bullu&#770;r (bulu&#770;r), which signifies crystal, or even glass, and moreover is the primary word for &#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, although the identical Sanskrit word, according to the laws of sound, vaidurja (Pali, velurija), is, according to the lexicons, a name of the lapis lazuli (Persic, lagurd). Of the two words &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the one appears to mean pearls and the other corals; the ancient appellations of these precious things which belong to the sea are also blended; the Persic merga&#770;n (Sanskr. mangara) unites the signification pearl and coral in itself. The root &#1508;&#1503;, Arab. fn, which has the primary notion of pushing, especially of vegetation (whence Arab. fann, a branch, shoot, prop. motion; French, jet), and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, where snow and milk, as figures of whiteness (purity), are placed in contrast with &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as a figure of redness, favour the signification corals for &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. The Coptic be no&#770;ni, which signifies gemma, favours (so far as it may be compared) corals rather than pearls. And the fact that &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>, appears as an Aramaean article of commerce in the market of Tyre, is more favourable to the signification pearls than corals; for the Babylonians sailed far into the Indian Ocean, and brought pearls from the fisheries of Bahrein, perhaps even from Ceylon, into the home markets (vid., Layard, New Discoveries, 536). The name is perhaps, from the Western Asiatic name of the pearl, <p>(Note: Vid., Zeitschr. fr d. Kunde des Morgenlandes, iv. 40f.

(1.) That &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; does not signify corals, he infers from <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, for the redness of corals cannot be a mark of bodily beauty; "but when I find that there are some pearls of a slightly reddish tinge, then I can understand and appreciate the comparison." (2.) That &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; signifies corals, is shown by the origin of the word, which properly signifies ree&#770;m-(wild oxen) horns, which is favoured by a mention of Pliny, h. n. xiii. 51: (Tradidere) juncos quoque lapideos perquam similes veris per litora, et in alto quasdam arbusculas colore bubuli cornus ramosas et cacuminibus rubentes. Although Pliny there speaks of marine petrified plants of the Indian Ocean (not, at least in his sense, of corals), this hint of a possible derivation of &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is certainly surprising. But as to <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, this passage is to be understood according to Sol 5:10 (my friend is &#1510;&#1495; &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;). The white and red are intended to be conceived of as mixed and overlapping one another, as our Germ. popular poetry speaks of cheeks which "shine with milk and purple;" and as in Homer, Il. iv. 141-146, the colour of the beautifully formed limbs of Menelaus is represented by the figure (which appears hideous to us): &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#837; (ebony stained with purple).)<p>The name of the &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; of Ethiopia appears to be derived from to'paz by transposition; Pliny says of the topaz, xxxvii. 8, 32, among other passages; Juba Topazum insulam in rubro mari a continenti stadiis CCC abesse dicit, nebulosam et ideo quaesitam saepius navigantibus; ex ea causa nomen accepisse: topazin enim Troglodytarum lingua significationem habere quaerendi. This topaz, however, which is said to be named after an island of the same name, the Isle of Serpents in Agatharchides and Diodorus, is, according to Pliny, yellowish green, and therefore distinct from the otherwise so-called topaz. To make a candid confession, we grope about everywhere in the dark here, and the ancient versions are not able to help us out of our difficulty.<p>(Note: The Targ. translates &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; by &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; &#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; by &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1494;&#1497;&#1494;&#1488; (Arab. sbz, vid., Pott in the Zeitschr.f.
