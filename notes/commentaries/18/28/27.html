They are: (1) seeing, or intuition; (2) declaring or numbering, ratiocination; (3) preparing or establishing, determination; (4) searching out, or investigation. Each of these actions implies the operation of mind, and is so far opposed to the fatality of an impersonal law or the fixed necessity of an inevitable nature.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-27.htm" title="Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yes, and searched it out.">Job 28:27</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then did he see it — </span>Namely, wisdom, which is the subject of the present discourse.

So it is spoken of God after the manner of men. Or, as <span class="greekheb">הכינה</span>, <span class="ital">hechinah, </span>may be properly rendered, <span class="ital">he established it, </span>namely, the order which he first fixed in the world, that it should continue in after ages. <span class="ital">And searched it out — </span>Not properly; for so searching implies ignorance, and requires time and industry, all which is repugnant to the divine perfections; but figuratively, he did, and doth, all things with that absolute and perfect wisdom, so exactly and perfectly, as if he had bestowed a long time in searching, to find them out.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:20-28 There is a two-fold wisdom; one hid in God, which is secret, and belongs not to us; the other made known by him, and revealed to man. One day's events, and one man's affairs, have such reference to, and so hang one upon another, that He only, to whom all is open, and who sees the whole at one view, can rightly judge of every part. But the knowledge of God's revealed will is within our reach, and will do us good. Let man look upon this as his wisdom, To fear the Lord, and to depart from evil. Let him learn that, and he is learned enough. Where is this wisdom to be found? The treasures of it are hid in Christ, revealed by the word, received by faith, through the Holy Ghost. It will not feed pride or vanity, or amuse our vain curiosity. It teaches and encourages sinners to fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, in the exercise of repentance and faith, without desiring to solve all difficulties about the events of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then did he see it - That is, then did he see wisdom. When in the work of creation he gave laws to the rain and the thunder storm; when he weighed out the winds and measured out the waters, then he saw and understood the principles of true wisdom. There is a remarkable similarity between the expression here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27-30</a>, "When he prepared the heavens, I((wisdom) was there; when he set a compass upon the face of the depth; when he established the clouds above; when he strengthened the foundations of the deep; when he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment; when he appointed the foundations of the earth; then I was by him as one brought up with him; I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him."<p>And declare it - Margin, "number." The word (&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;  sa&#770;phar) means, however, rather to "declare," or to "narrate;" and the idea is, that even then he made known to intelligent beings the true principles of wisdom, as consisting in the fear of the Lord, and in suitable veneration for the Most High. "In what way" this was made known, Job does not say; but there can be no doubt of the fact to which he adverts, that even in his time the great principles of all real wisdom were made known to created intelligences, as consisting in profound veneration of God, in a willingness to bow under his dispensations, and to confide in him.<p>He prepared it - Made it a matter of "thought" and "inquiry" to find out what was real wisdom, and communicated it in a proper way to his creatures. The idea is, that it was not the result of chance, nor did it spring up of its own accord, but it was a matter of "intelligent investigation" on the part of God to know what constituted true wisdom. Probably, also, Job here means to refer to the attempts of man to investigate it, and to say that its value was enhanced from the fact that it had even required "the search of God" to find it out. Beautiful eulogiums of Wisdom may be seen in the Apocryphal book Ecclesiasticus, of which the following is a specimen:<p>Wisdom shall praise herself,<p>And shall glory in the midst of her people.<p>In the congregation of the Most High shall she open her mouth,<p>And triumph before his power.<p>I came out of the mouth of the Most High,<p>And covered the earth as a cloud.<p>I dwell in high places,<p>And my throne is in a cloudy pillar.<p>I alone compassed the circuit of heaven,<p>And walked in the bottom of the deep.<p>In the waves of the sea, and in all the earth,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. declare&#8212;manifest her, namely, in His works (Ps 19:1, 2). So the approval bestowed by the Creator on His works (Ge 1:10, 31); compare the "rejoicing" of wisdom at the same (Pr 8:30; which Umbreit translates; "I was the skilful artificer by His side").<p>prepared&#8212;not created, for wisdom is from everlasting (Pr 8:22-31); but "established" her as Governor of the world.<p>searched &#8230; out&#8212;examined her works to see whether she was adequate to the task of governing the world [Maurer].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> either from eternity, when he decreed what he would do, or when he first created them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Did he see it, </span> i.e. wisdom, which is the subject matter of the present discourse. This God saw not abroad, but within himself; he looked or reflected upon it in his own mind, as the rule by which he would proceed in the creation and government of all things, managing them in such ways and methods as were most agreeable to his own most wise and unsearchable counsels, which no human or created wit can reach or pierce into. Or, <span class="ital">he saw it</span>, so as to declare it, as it follows; so as to make it visible and manifest in some measure to his creatures. Or, <span class="ital">he saw it</span>, i.e. he enjoyed it, <span class="ital">seeing</span> being oft put for enjoying, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm" title="I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.">Psalm 27:13</a> 34:12 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm" title="I said in my heart, Go to now, I will prove you with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 2:1</a> 3:13</span>.

Or, <span class="ital">he settled</span> or <span class="ital">established it</span>, i.e. he firmly purposed to do such and such things in such manner as he thought meet, and he established the order which he first made in the world, that it should continue in after-ages. Or, <span class="ital">he directed it</span>, and directed and ordered all things by it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Searched it out; </span> not properly; for so searching implies ignorance, and that a man is at a loss, and requires time and industry, all which is repugnant to the Divine reflections; but figuratively, as such expressions are oft used concerning God, i.e. he did and doth all things with that absolute and perfect wisdom, and he knoweth all his own counsels and actions, and the reasons of them, so exactly and perfectly, as if he had bestowed a long time in searching and judging to find them out. And this and the other acts mentioned in this verse are to be understood of God solely and exclusively, it being here, as it is oft elsewhere in this book, sufficiently implied, that this kind of Divine wisdom, which consists in the accurate knowledge of all God’s counsels and works, is far above, out of man’s reach. Man doth not see this wisdom but only so far as God is pleased to reveal it to him, and therefore he cannot <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">declare</span> it to others; man did not <span class="ital">prepare</span>, nor <span class="ital">order</span>, nor <span class="ital">contrive</span> it, and therefore no wonder if he cannot <span class="ital">search it out</span>. And so this is most fitly connected with the following verse; for as here he tells us what wisdom is denied to man, so there he informeth us what is granted to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then did he see it, and declare it,.... His own wisdom, when he made and executed his decrees concerning rain, lightning, and thunder; he saw it in himself, and as it appeared in the works of his hands, which he looked on and approved of, and saw that all was very good; and he declared it to others, by his works of nature and providence; for they declare the glory of God, and particularly the glory of his wisdom: <p>he prepared it, yea, and searched it out; he prepared it in his counsels, according to which he wrought all things in the creation, and still does in Providence; and his searching out denotes his perfect knowledge of it, and the way and course of it, or he takes with it, though it is unsearchable, and past finding out by us. Mr. Broughton understands this of a person, as do some others, even Christ, the Wisdom of God; rendering the words, "then he saw her, and showed her", &amp;c. and so the passages in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>, may be a comment on these words and the foregoing; for when the above decrees were formed in the divine mind, then he "saw" his Wisdom, his Logos, his eternal Son; for he was by him, and with him, and in him, lying in his bosom; he looked at him in creation, and made man after his image, the idea he had formed of his human nature, and made all things for his sake; and he viewed him with the utmost delight and pleasure, as being the express image of his person; he declared him to be his only begotten Son, saying, "this day I have begotten thee", <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; be made him known to the angels, as the Targum here expresses it, and what he designed to do by him, and with him; which occasioned the revolt of many of them from him; and he declared him to Adam as soon as there was an opportunity and occasion for it; he prepared him in his eternal purposes to be the Redeemer and Saviour of his people, to be the Head of the church, and the Judge of quick and dead; he searched him out in his infinite wisdom, and found him, singled him out, laid help on him with his holy oil anointed him, and appointed him to be the ransomer of his chosen ones, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-24.htm">Job 33:24</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">then did he see it</span>] <span class="ital">then</span>, i. e. when He made a decree for the rain—in the act or at the time of creation, when He gave material agencies their laws. Then He “saw” Wisdom, she presented herself to His view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and declare it</span>] The margin <span class="ital">number</span> or count (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-37.htm" title="Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,">Job 38:37</a>) gives a very good sense, the meaning being that God went over, enumerated or <span class="ital">surveyed</span> the parts and complex powers of Wisdom. The meaning will not be greatly different if the rendering “declare” be retained and taken in the sense of <span class="ital">uttered.</span> This might be done by pronouncing the name of Wisdom, as God presents before His own mind the meaning of any servant or agent of His by calling him by his name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm" title="But now thus said the LORD that created you, O Jacob, and he that formed you, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed you, I have called you by your name; you are mine.">Isaiah 43:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-3.htm" title="And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, the LORD, which call you by your name, am the God of Israel.">Isaiah 45:3</a>). Others take “declare” in the sense that God gave expression to Wisdom in the varied works of creation. This is a very unnatural sense in which to take “declare.” Besides, of the four expressions used, “saw,” “declared,” “established,” “searched out,” the first and last refer exclusively to acts of the Divine mind and it is improbable that the middle terms should refer to acts or operations of God’s creative hand. Nor is there allusion to any to whom the declaration was made, God alone being referred to in the verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he prepared it</span>] Or, <span class="bld">established it</span>. The sense appears to be the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.">Proverbs 8:22</a> “the Lord <span class="ital">formed</span> me,” i. e. gave me existence. The Writer conceives Wisdom, if not as a person, at least as something that has being or existence of its own. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-23.htm" title="I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.">Proverbs 8:23</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>. Wisdom received its existence prior to the creation of the world. In the present passage it is not quite easy to say whether the idea be that Wisdom received existence <span class="ital">in</span> creation or before it, at least it did so in connexion with creation (“then”). It is unnecessary, however, and contrary to the Poet’s vivid conception of Wisdom as a real thing or being, to suppose that it was “established” when embodied in the stable, permanent order of created things, as if, being merely an idea before, with wavering outlines, it then became fixed. Neither can the meaning be that God “set up” Wisdom before Him merely as an object of contemplation; much less that He set it up as a “model” after which to work in creating the world, or constituted it “the conductor of the whole general order of the world.” These are all additional ideas, hardly warranted by the expression employed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yea, and searched it out</span>] The word <span class="ital">yea</span> implies that this searching out of Wisdom was something higher than the preceding acts. God explored Wisdom, He saw through it, and brought before Himself the full idea of all that was in its nature and its powers. The word can hardly mean He <span class="ital">proved</span> it, e. g. to see whether it was suitable or able for its great function, the guidance of the course of things in the world. This again is an additional idea, which the word does not express.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then did he see it, and declare it</span>. From the creation of the world, and before it, God foresaw all that was necessary to maintain his universe in the perfect order and the perfect beauty that he designed for it. At the Creation he, in a certain sense, "declared it," or set it forth, before such intelligences as then existed. Subsequently, in part to Adam, in part to Noah, in part to Moses, he further declared, by revelation, at any rate a portion of the design of his creation, and of the laws by which it was regulated. <span class="cmt_word">He prepared it, yea, and searched it out</span>. This is an inversion of what seems to us the natural order, whereof there are many examples. God must first have investigated and searched out, in his own secret counsels, the entire scheme of creation, and afterwards have proceeded to the "preparation" or "establishment" of it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  It is veiled from the eyes of all living,<p>And concealed from the fowls of heaven.<p>22  Destruction and death say:<p>With our ears we heard a report of it. - <p>23  Elohim understandeth the way to it,<p>And He - He knoweth its place.<p>24  For He looketh to the ends of the earth,<p>Under the whole heaven He seeth.<p>No living created being (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a>) is able to answer the question; even the birds that fly aloft, that have keener and farther-seeing eyes than man, can give us no information concerning wisdom; and the world at least proclaims its existence in a rich variety of its operations, but in the realm of Abaddon and of death below (comp. the combination &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>) it is known only by an indistinct hearsay, and from confused impressions. Therefore: no creature, whether in the realm of the living or the dead, can help us to get wisdom. There is but One who possesses a perfect knowledge concerning wisdom, namely Elohim, whose gave extends to the ends of the earth, and who sees under the whole heaven, i.e., is everywhere present (&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, definition of place, not equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;; comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>), who therefore, after the removal of everything earthly (sub-celestial), alone remains. And why should He with His knowledge, which embraces everything, not also know the way and place of wisdom? Wisdom is indeed the ideal, according to which He has created the world. </body></html>
