To confirm this, he showed of what a great deal of knowledge and wealth men may make themselves masters. The caverns of the earth may be discovered, but not the counsels of Heaven. Go to the miners, thou sluggard in religion, consider their ways, and be wise. Let their courage and diligence in seeking the wealth that perishes, shame us out of slothfulness and faint-heartedness in labouring for the true riches. How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! How much easier, and safer! Yet gold is sought for, but grace neglected. Will the hopes of precious things out of the earth, so men call them, though really they are paltry and perishing, be such a spur to industry, and shall not the certain prospect of truly precious things in heaven be much more so?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He cutteth out rivers among the rocks - That is, in his operations of mining, he cuts channels for the water to flow off through the rocks.

By cleaving rocks asunder in order to find out things of value in the cliffs of them; or by cutting his way through them, the miner opens a course for rivers and floods of water, to drain off from his mines, and so can go on with his works more comfortably, and with success; though sometimes they sink through high rocks, till they go so far below their basis, that they can go no further for water, in some places forty or fifty fathom deep (i): <p>and his eye seeth every precious thing; in the cliffs of the rock, or at the bottom of the rivers and floods, as they go off, or in the mines he digs, even gold or silver, or precious stones: hence came the fable of Lynceus, and from him the phrase of Lyncean eyes (k), who was said to see all things under the earth, because he was the first that searched for metals, as brass, silver, &amp;c. and in search of them carried lamps, or links, under the earth (l). This verse is also by some ascribed to God, who is said to cleave the fountain and the flood, and to dry up mighty rivers; and also to open rivers in high places, in hills, mountains, and rocks, as well as sometimes in the middle of the valleys, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a>; and who, in a spiritual sense, has cut out and opened the river of his pure love and grace, which flows from the throne of God and the Lamb; and the fulness of grace in Christ, which is as rivers of water in a dry land; and the graces of the Spirit in his people, which flow out of them as rivers of living water; and his word and ordinances in his church, which are the rivers of pleasure he makes his saints to drink of in it: and his eye of omniscience, which sees all things in particular, sees all the precious things in nature; the precious things of heaven, and earth, and sea; the precious things brought forth by the sun and moon; and the precious tidings of the ancient mountains and everlasting hills, the gold, silver, and precious stones that lie hid in the bowels of them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>; and who also sees all precious persons, and things, in a spiritual sense; he beholds his precious Son, his precious blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, with delight and pleasure; and his eye of love, grace, and mercy, upon the precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, jewels, and precious stones; and sees all the precious graces of the Spirit in them, with acceptance and good will. <p>(i) Philos.

Such canals might be intended for drawing off the water accumulating in the mine. The second clause suggests, however, that the word rather means <span class="ital">passages</span> or galleries, cut in order to pursue the vein, for it is said, “his eye seeth every precious thing.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cutteth out rivers among the rocks</span>. Some understand this of man's general ability to cut canals and tunnels, and change the course of rivers. But the allusion is more probably to the works undertaken in mines for the carrying off of the water from them. Diodorus says that when subterranean springs were tapped in mines, which threatened to flood them, it was usual to construct ducts, or tunnels, by which the inconvenient liquid might be carried off to a lower level (Diod. Siculus, 5:37. &sect; 3). <span class="cmt_word">And his eye seeth every precious thing</span>. Nothing escapes his notice. Even as he constructs these duets he has his eye open to note any signs of mineral wealth, of metals or of precious stones, that occur along the line of his excavation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Job now describes the operation of mining more minutely; and it is worthy of observation that the last-mentioned metal, with which the description is closely connected, is copper. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, which signifies elsewhere a valley, the bed of a river, and the river itself, like the Arab. wa&#770;din (not from &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;  equals  &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;, to flow on, as Ges. Thes. and Frst, but from &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, root &#1495;&#1500; to hollow, whence &#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, a flute, as being a hollowed musical instrument), signifies here the excavation made in the earth, and in fact, as what follows shows, in a perpendicular direction, therefore the shaft. Nasse contends for the signification "valley," by which one might very well conceive of "the working of a surface vein:" "By this mode of working, a small shaft is made in the vein (consequently in a perpendicular direction), and the ore is worked from both sides at once. At a short distance from the first shaft a second is formed, and worked in the same way. Since thus the work progresses lengthwise, a cutting becomes formed in the mountain which may well be compared to a deep valley, if, as is generally the case where the stone is firm and the ways are almost perpendicular, the space that is hewn out remains open (that is, not broken in or filled in)." But if &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; everywhere else denotes a valley with its watercourse, it has not necessarily a like signification in mining technology. It signifies, perhaps not without reference to its usual signification, the shafts open above and surrounded by walls of rock (in distinction from the more or less horizontal galleries or pit-ways, as they were cut through the excavated rocks in the gold mines of Upper Egypt, often so crooked that, as Diodorus relates, the miners, provided with lights on their forehead, were always obliged to vary the posture of the body (according to the windings of the galleries); and &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, away from him who remains above, shows that one is to imagine these shafts as being of considerable depth,; but what follows even more clearly indicates this: there forgotten (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; with the demonstrative art. as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-5.htm">Job 26:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>, Ges. 109 ad init.) of (every) foot (that walks above), they hang (comp.

The &#1502;&#1504;&#1497; of &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;, taken strictly, does not correspond to the Greek &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, neither does it form an adverbial secondary definition standing by itself: far away from the foot; but it is to be understood as &#1502;&#1503; is also used elsewhere after &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-21.htm">Deuteronomy 31:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a> : forgotten out of the mouth, out of the heart; here: forgotten away from the foot, so that this advances without knowing that there is a man beneath; therefore: totally vanished from the remembrance of those who pass by above. &#1502;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is not to be connected with &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (Hahn, Schlottm.), but with &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, for Munach is the representative of Rebia mugrasch, according to Psalter, ii. 503, 2; and &#1491;&#1500;&#1493; is regularly Milel, whereas <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> is Milra without any evident reason. The accentuation here follows no fixed law with equally regulated exceptions (vid., Olsh. 233, c).<p>Moreover, the perception that <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-4.htm">Job 28:4</a> speaks of the shaft of the mine, and the descent of the miners by a rope, is due to modern exegesis; even Schultens, who here exclaims: Cimmeriae tenebrae, quas me exsuperaturum vix sperare ausim, perceived the right thing, but only imperfectly as yet. By &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; he understands the course or vein of the metal, where it is embedded; and, since he understands &#1490;&#1512; after the Arab. &#8219;garr, foot of the mountain, he translates: rumpit (homo) alveum de pede montis. Rosenm., on the other hand, correctly translates: canalem deorsum actum ex loco quo versatur homo. Schlottm. understands by gr the miner himself dwelling as a stranger in his loneliness; and if we imagine to ourselves the mining districts of the peninsula of Sinai, we might certainly at once conceive the miners' dwellings themselves which are found in the neighbourhood of the shaft in connection with &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1490;&#1512;. But in and for itself &#1490;&#1512; signifies only those settled (above), without the secondary idea of strangers. </body></html>
