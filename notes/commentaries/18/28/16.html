Its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be bought with money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so in ours.

The locality of Ophir has been much contested, but, on the whole, the weight of evidence would seem to be in favour of Arabia, on the south-east coast (see the article on "Ophir" in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' which exhausts all that can be said on the subject). The high estimation in which "gold of Ophir" was held appears not only in this passage, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>: and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>. It is to be accounted for by the imperfection of all the anciently known processes of refining, which left the best refined gold inferior to the natural product of the Ophir mines or washings. <span class="cmt_word">With the precious onyx, or the sapphire</span>. (On the latter of these two stones, see the comment upon ver. 6.) The "onyx" is probably the stone now known as the "sardonyx," which was highly prized by the ancients. It had a place in the breastplate of the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a>), and is mentioned among the treasures of the King of Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>). The sardonyx presents layers variously coloured, as blue, black, white, and vermilion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  9  He layeth his hand upon the pebbles;<p>He turneth up the mountains from the root.<p>10  He cutteth canals through the rocks;<p>And his eye seeth all kinds of precious things.<p>11  That they may not leak, he dammeth up rivers;<p>And that which is hidden he bringeth to light.<p>12  But wisdom, whence is it obtained?<p>And where is the place of understanding?<p>Beneath, whither no other being of the upper world penetrates, man puts his hand upon the quartz or rock. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (perhaps from &#1495;&#1500;&#1501;, to be strong, firm: Arabic, with the reduplication resolved, chalnubu&#770;s, like &#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. &#8219;ancabu&#770;th, vid., Jesurun, p. 229) signifies here the quartz, and in general the hard stone; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468; something like our "to take in hand" of an undertaking requiring strong determination and courage, which here consists in blasting and clearing away the rock that contains no ore, as Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. 4, 21, describes it: Occursant ... silices; hos igne et aceto rumpunt, saepius vero, quoniam id cuniculos vapore et fumo strangulat, caedunt fractariis CL libras ferri habentibus egeruntque umeris noctibus ac diebus per tenebras proxumis tradentes; lucem novissimi cernunt. Further: he (man, devoted to mining) overturns (subvertit according to the primary signification of &#1492;&#1508;&#1498;, Arab. 'fk, 'ft, to turn, twist) mountains from the roots. The accentuation &#1492;&#1508;&#1498; with Rebia mugrasch, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with Mercha, is false; it is, according to Codd. and old editions, to be accented &#1492;&#1508;&#1498; with Tarcha, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with Munach, and to be translated accordingly: subvertit a radice montes (for Munach is the transformation of a Rebia mugrasch), not a radice montium. Blasting in mining which lays bare the roots (the lowest parts) of the mountains is intended, the conclusion of which - the signal for the flight of the workmen, and the effective crash - is so graphically described by Pliny in the passage cited above: Peracto opere cervices fornicum ab ultumo cadunt; dat signum ruina eamque solus intellegit in cacumine ejus montis vigil. Hic voce, nutu evocari jubet operas pariterque ipse devolat. Mons fractus cadit ab sese longe fragore qui concipi humana mente non possit eque efflatu incredibili spectant victores ruinam naturae.<p>The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-10.htm">Job 28:10</a> depends upon the signification of the &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. It is certainly the most natural that it should signify canals. The word is Egyptian; aur in the language of the hieroglyphs signifies a river, and especially the Nile; wherefore at the close of the Laterculus of Eratosthenes the name of the king, &#x3a6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834; (&#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;), is explained by &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. If water-canals are intended, they may be either such as go in or come away. In the first case it may mean water let in like a cataract over the ruins of the blasted auriferous rock, the corrugi of Pliny: Alius par labor ac vel majoris impendi: flumina ad lavandam hanc ruinam jugis montium obiter duxere a centesimo plerumque lapide; corrugos vocant, a corrivatione credo; mille et hic labores. But &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506; is not a suitable word for such an extensive and powerful flooding with water for the purpose of washing the gold. It suits far better to understand the expression of galleries or ways cut horizontally in the rock to carry the water away. Thus von Veltheim explains it: "The miner makes ways through the hard rock into his section in which the perpendicular shaft terminates, guides the water which is found in abundance at that depth through it [i.e., the water as the bottom of the pit that hinders the progress of the work], and is able [thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-10.htm">Job 28:10</a> naturally is connected with what precedes] to judge of the ore and fragments that are at the bottom, and bring them to the light. This mode of mining by constantly forming one gallery under the other [so that a new gallery is made under the pit that is worked out by extending the shaft, and also freeing this from water by making another outlet below the previous one] is the oldest of all, of which anything certain is known in the history of mining, and the most natural in the days when they had no notion of hydraulics." This explanation is far more satisfactory than that of Herm. Sam. Reimarus, of the "Wolfenbtteler Fragmente" (in his edition of the Neue Erkl. des B. Hiob, by John Ad. Hoffmann, 1734, iv. S. 772): "He breaks open watercourses in the rocks. What the miners call coming upon water, is when they break into a fissure from which strong streams of water gush forth. The miner not only knows how to turn such water to good account, but it is also a sign that there are rich veins of ore near at hand, as there is the most water by these courses and fissures. Hence follows: and then his eye sees all kinds of precious things." But there is no ground for saying that water indicates rich veins of ore, and &#1489;&#1511;&#1506; is much more appropriate to describe the designed formation of courses to carry off the water than an accidental discovery of water in course of the work; moreover, &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is as appropriate to the former as it is inappropriate to the latter explanation, for it signifies elsewhere the arms of the Nile, into which the Nile is artificially divided; and therefore it may easily be transferred to the horizontal canals of the mine cut through the hard rock (or through the upper earth). Nevertheless, although the water plays an important part in mining operations, by giving rise to the greatest difficulties, as it frequently happens that a pit is deluged with water, and must be abandoned because no one can get down to it: it is improbable that <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-10.htm">Job 28:10</a> as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-11.htm">Job 28:11</a> refers to this; we therefore prefer to understand &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as meaning the (horizontal) courses (galleries or drifts) in which the ore is dug, - a rendering which is all the more possible, since, on the one hand, in Coptic jaro (Sahidic jero) signifies the Nile of Egypt (phiaro ente che&#770;mi); on the other, ior (eioor) signifies a ditch, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be; (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>, &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), vid., Ges. Thes. Thus also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-10.htm">Job 28:10</a> is consistently connected with what precedes, since by cutting these cuniculi the courses of the ore (veins), and any precious stones that may also be embedded there, are laid bare.</body></html>
