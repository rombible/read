One day's events, and one man's affairs, have such reference to, and so hang one upon another, that He only, to whom all is open, and who sees the whole at one view, can rightly judge of every part. But the knowledge of God's revealed will is within our reach, and will do us good. Let man look upon this as his wisdom, To fear the Lord, and to depart from evil. Let him learn that, and he is learned enough. Where is this wisdom to be found? The treasures of it are hid in Christ, revealed by the word, received by faith, through the Holy Ghost. It will not feed pride or vanity, or amuse our vain curiosity. It teaches and encourages sinners to fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, in the exercise of repentance and faith, without desiring to solve all difficulties about the events of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he looketh to the ends of the earth - That is, God sees and knows everything.

In this and some following verses, reasons and are given, which abundantly show that God must know the way and place of wisdom; since all the parts and places of the earth, even to the ends of it, are seen by him, and all creatures and things in it; nor is there anything in heaven, earth, and hell, that is hid from him; and therefore if there is a way to it, or a place for it, he must needs know it; where its direction is, or where it steers its course, and takes up its abode <p>and seeth under the whole heaven; the fowls of the air, the beasts of the field, the inhabitants of the world, and all that is done in it; everything falls under the eye of his omniscience, and under the notice of his providence, which extends to all creatures and things throughout the whole earth, and under the compass of the heavens; and since all places and persons are obvious to his view, and all subject to his all wise and disposing providence, and are ordered, directed, and governed, according to his sovereign will and pleasure; the path of wisdom, and the place of understanding, he must be acquainted with; and particularly his all seeing eye, and all powerful providence, are concerned in the following things, and in which there are wonderful proofs of his knowledge and wisdom. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>.

Man is conditioned. God is unconditioned. Man's knowledge has strict and narrow limits. God "looketh unto the <span class="accented">ends of the earth."</span> It is the universality of God's knowledge that makes each item of it perfect. Where knowledge is circumscribed, it is impossible to be sure that some truth outside the circle of the person's cognizance has not a bearing on that which is within his cognizance - a bearing, which, if he were aware of it, would give the truth a different aspect. With God alone there are no such limits, everything being within his cognizance. <span class="cmt_word">And seeth under the whole heaven</span>. As his knowledge of earthly things is unlimited, so is his knowledge of heavenly things also; and not only of heavenly things in a material sense, as of sun, moon, stars, comets, planets, nebulae, etc., but also of causes, principles, ends, laws, and the like, whereby both material and immaterial things are governed, ordered, and maintained in being. Of matters of this kind and character man can only say, "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; I cannot attain unto it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17  Gold and glass are not equal to it,<p>Nor is it exchanged for jewels of gold.<p>18  Pearls and crystal are not to be mentioned,<p>And the acquisition of wisdom is beyond corals.<p>19  The topaz of Ethiopia is not equal to it,<p>It is not outweighed by pure fine gold.<p>20  Whence, then, cometh wisdom,<p>And which is the place of understanding?<p>Among the separate &#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a>, which are here detailed, apart from &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, glass has the transparent name &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1514;, or, as it is pointed in Codd., in old editions, and by Kimchi, &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1514;, with Cholem (in the dialects with &#1490; instead of )&#1499;. Symm. indeed translates crystal, and in fact the ancient languages have common names for glass and crystal; but the crystal is here called &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which signifies prop., like the Arab. 'gibs, ice; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; also signifies prop. ice, and this only in Homer, then crystal, exactly as the cognate &#1511;&#1512;&#1495; unites both significations in itself. The reason of this homonymy lies deeper than in the outward similarity, - the ancients really thought the crystal was a product of the cold; Pliny, xxxvii. 2, 9, says: non alibi certe reperitur quam ubi maxume hibernae nives rigent, glaciemque esse certum est, unde nomen Graeci dedere. The Targ. translates &#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; by &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, certainly in the sense of the Arabico-Persic bullu&#770;r (bulu&#770;r), which signifies crystal, or even glass, and moreover is the primary word for &#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, although the identical Sanskrit word, according to the laws of sound, vaidurja (Pali, velurija), is, according to the lexicons, a name of the lapis lazuli (Persic, lagurd). Of the two words &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the one appears to mean pearls and the other corals; the ancient appellations of these precious things which belong to the sea are also blended; the Persic merga&#770;n (Sanskr. mangara) unites the signification pearl and coral in itself. The root &#1508;&#1503;, Arab. fn, which has the primary notion of pushing, especially of vegetation (whence Arab. fann, a branch, shoot, prop. motion; French, jet), and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, where snow and milk, as figures of whiteness (purity), are placed in contrast with &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as a figure of redness, favour the signification corals for &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. The Coptic be no&#770;ni, which signifies gemma, favours (so far as it may be compared) corals rather than pearls. And the fact that &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>, appears as an Aramaean article of commerce in the market of Tyre, is more favourable to the signification pearls than corals; for the Babylonians sailed far into the Indian Ocean, and brought pearls from the fisheries of Bahrein, perhaps even from Ceylon, into the home markets (vid., Layard, New Discoveries, 536). The name is perhaps, from the Western Asiatic name of the pearl, <p>(Note: Vid., Zeitschr. fr d. Kunde des Morgenlandes, iv. 40f.

(1.) That &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; does not signify corals, he infers from <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, for the redness of corals cannot be a mark of bodily beauty; "but when I find that there are some pearls of a slightly reddish tinge, then I can understand and appreciate the comparison." (2.) That &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; signifies corals, is shown by the origin of the word, which properly signifies ree&#770;m-(wild oxen) horns, which is favoured by a mention of Pliny, h. n. xiii. 51: (Tradidere) juncos quoque lapideos perquam similes veris per litora, et in alto quasdam arbusculas colore bubuli cornus ramosas et cacuminibus rubentes. Although Pliny there speaks of marine petrified plants of the Indian Ocean (not, at least in his sense, of corals), this hint of a possible derivation of &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is certainly surprising. But as to <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, this passage is to be understood according to Sol 5:10 (my friend is &#1510;&#1495; &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;). The white and red are intended to be conceived of as mixed and overlapping one another, as our Germ. popular poetry speaks of cheeks which "shine with milk and purple;" and as in Homer, Il. iv. 141-146, the colour of the beautifully formed limbs of Menelaus is represented by the figure (which appears hideous to us): &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#837; (ebony stained with purple).)<p>The name of the &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; of Ethiopia appears to be derived from to'paz by transposition; Pliny says of the topaz, xxxvii. 8, 32, among other passages; Juba Topazum insulam in rubro mari a continenti stadiis CCC abesse dicit, nebulosam et ideo quaesitam saepius navigantibus; ex ea causa nomen accepisse: topazin enim Troglodytarum lingua significationem habere quaerendi. This topaz, however, which is said to be named after an island of the same name, the Isle of Serpents in Agatharchides and Diodorus, is, according to Pliny, yellowish green, and therefore distinct from the otherwise so-called topaz. To make a candid confession, we grope about everywhere in the dark here, and the ancient versions are not able to help us out of our difficulty.<p>(Note: The Targ. translates &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; by &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; &#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; by &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1494;&#1497;&#1494;&#1488; (Arab. sbz, vid., Pott in the Zeitschr.f.
