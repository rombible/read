One day's events, and one man's affairs, have such reference to, and so hang one upon another, that He only, to whom all is open, and who sees the whole at one view, can rightly judge of every part. But the knowledge of God's revealed will is within our reach, and will do us good. Let man look upon this as his wisdom, To fear the Lord, and to depart from evil. Let him learn that, and he is learned enough. Where is this wisdom to be found? The treasures of it are hid in Christ, revealed by the word, received by faith, through the Holy Ghost. It will not feed pride or vanity, or amuse our vain curiosity. It teaches and encourages sinners to fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, in the exercise of repentance and faith, without desiring to solve all difficulties about the events of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When he made a decree for the rain - A statute or law (&#1495;&#1511;  cho&#770;q) by which the rain is regulated. It is not sent by chance or hap-hazard. It is under the operation of regular and settled laws. We cannot suppose that those laws were understood in the time of Job, but the fact might be understood that the rain was regulated by laws, and that fact would show that God was qualified to impart wisdom. His kingdom was a kingdom of settled law and not of chance or caprice, and if the rain was regulated by statute, it was fair to presume that he did not deal with his people by chance, and that afflictions were not sent without rule; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-6.htm">Job 5:6</a>.<p>And a way - A path through which the rapid lightning should pass - referring, perhaps, to the apparent "opening" in the clouds in which the lightning seems to move along.<p>The lightning of the thunder - The word "lightning" here (&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1494;  cha&#774;z&#305;&#770;yz) properly means "an arrow," from &#1492;&#1494;&#1494;  ha&#772;zaz, obsolete, to pierce through, to transfix, to performate; and hence, the lightning - from the rapidity with which it passes - like an arrow. The word "thunder" (&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;  qo&#770;lo&#770;t) means voices, and hence, "thunder," as being by way of eminence the voice of God; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-5</a>. The whole expression here means "the thunder-flash." Coverdale renders this, "when he gave the mighty floods a law;" but it undoubtedly refers to the thunderstorm, and the idea is, that he who controls the rapid lightning, regulating its laws and directing its path through the heavens, is qualified to communicate truth to people, and can explain the great principles on which his government is administered. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

Decreed within himself that he would give it; for rain is his gift alone, and which none of the vanities of the Gentiles can give, and a wonderful blessing to the earth it is; and which God bestows on all sorts of men, both good and bad, and causes it to fall sometimes on one place and sometimes on another, sometimes in greater, sometimes in lesser showers; and according to his sovereign pleasure he gives or withholds it; the effects of which are quickly seen. Mr. Broughton renders the clause, "he made a bound for the rain, and a way for the lightning of thunder", or "the lightning and the thunder", as Ben Gersom, who thinks the copulative  "and", is wanting. Thunder is from God, it is his voice, and the word here used is in the plural number, "voices" (m), signifying various claps of thunder; and lightning generally accompanies it, which, though first perceived, they are both at once the eye doing its office quicker than the ear; and a cloud also is usual; and so some render the word for lightning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>; it may signify the way of the lightning out of the thunder cloud, and attending claps of thunder; the thunder breaks the cloud and makes a path for the lightning: the Targum is, <p>"a path for the lightnings, which run with the voices or thunders;'' <p>but, though the course or path the lightning steers is very quick and very extensive from east to west, and cannot be traced by us. God that made it knows it, and he knows the path and place of wisdom. Sephorno interprets this of the thunder and lightnings at the giving of the law, which he understands by wisdom, as do other Jewish writers: Pliny (n) speaks of thunder and lightning as chance matters; but Seneca (o) more truly ascribes them to divine power and Providence, as here. <p>(m) "vocum", Piscator, Mercerus, Drusius.

God "made a decree for the rain" when be placed the fall of rain under fixed and unalterable laws. In some countries rainy seasons begin almost regularly on a fixed day in the calendar, while for several months in the year it is almost certain that rain will not fall. Even where there is no such exact regularity as this, the rainfall has its laws, since there are maxima and minima which are never exceeded. <span class="cmt_word">And a way for the lightning of the thunder</span>. God gave laws to the electric current, and prescribed the "way" that it should take in its passage from heaven to earth, or from cloud to cloud, or from earth to heaven.

Symm. indeed translates crystal, and in fact the ancient languages have common names for glass and crystal; but the crystal is here called &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which signifies prop., like the Arab. 'gibs, ice; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; also signifies prop. ice, and this only in Homer, then crystal, exactly as the cognate &#1511;&#1512;&#1495; unites both significations in itself. The reason of this homonymy lies deeper than in the outward similarity, - the ancients really thought the crystal was a product of the cold; Pliny, xxxvii. 2, 9, says: non alibi certe reperitur quam ubi maxume hibernae nives rigent, glaciemque esse certum est, unde nomen Graeci dedere. The Targ. translates &#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; by &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, certainly in the sense of the Arabico-Persic bullu&#770;r (bulu&#770;r), which signifies crystal, or even glass, and moreover is the primary word for &#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, although the identical Sanskrit word, according to the laws of sound, vaidurja (Pali, velurija), is, according to the lexicons, a name of the lapis lazuli (Persic, lagurd). Of the two words &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the one appears to mean pearls and the other corals; the ancient appellations of these precious things which belong to the sea are also blended; the Persic merga&#770;n (Sanskr. mangara) unites the signification pearl and coral in itself. The root &#1508;&#1503;, Arab. fn, which has the primary notion of pushing, especially of vegetation (whence Arab. fann, a branch, shoot, prop. motion; French, jet), and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, where snow and milk, as figures of whiteness (purity), are placed in contrast with &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as a figure of redness, favour the signification corals for &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. The Coptic be no&#770;ni, which signifies gemma, favours (so far as it may be compared) corals rather than pearls. And the fact that &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>, appears as an Aramaean article of commerce in the market of Tyre, is more favourable to the signification pearls than corals; for the Babylonians sailed far into the Indian Ocean, and brought pearls from the fisheries of Bahrein, perhaps even from Ceylon, into the home markets (vid., Layard, New Discoveries, 536). The name is perhaps, from the Western Asiatic name of the pearl, <p>(Note: Vid., Zeitschr. fr d. Kunde des Morgenlandes, iv. 40f.

(1.) That &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; does not signify corals, he infers from <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, for the redness of corals cannot be a mark of bodily beauty; "but when I find that there are some pearls of a slightly reddish tinge, then I can understand and appreciate the comparison." (2.) That &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; signifies corals, is shown by the origin of the word, which properly signifies ree&#770;m-(wild oxen) horns, which is favoured by a mention of Pliny, h. n. xiii. 51: (Tradidere) juncos quoque lapideos perquam similes veris per litora, et in alto quasdam arbusculas colore bubuli cornus ramosas et cacuminibus rubentes. Although Pliny there speaks of marine petrified plants of the Indian Ocean (not, at least in his sense, of corals), this hint of a possible derivation of &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is certainly surprising. But as to <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, this passage is to be understood according to Sol 5:10 (my friend is &#1510;&#1495; &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;). The white and red are intended to be conceived of as mixed and overlapping one another, as our Germ. popular poetry speaks of cheeks which "shine with milk and purple;" and as in Homer, Il. iv. 141-146, the colour of the beautifully formed limbs of Menelaus is represented by the figure (which appears hideous to us): &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#837; (ebony stained with purple).)<p>The name of the &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; of Ethiopia appears to be derived from to'paz by transposition; Pliny says of the topaz, xxxvii. 8, 32, among other passages; Juba Topazum insulam in rubro mari a continenti stadiis CCC abesse dicit, nebulosam et ideo quaesitam saepius navigantibus; ex ea causa nomen accepisse: topazin enim Troglodytarum lingua significationem habere quaerendi. This topaz, however, which is said to be named after an island of the same name, the Isle of Serpents in Agatharchides and Diodorus, is, according to Pliny, yellowish green, and therefore distinct from the otherwise so-called topaz. To make a candid confession, we grope about everywhere in the dark here, and the ancient versions are not able to help us out of our difficulty.<p>(Note: The Targ. translates &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; by &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; &#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; by &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1494;&#1497;&#1494;&#1488; (Arab. sbz, vid., Pott in the Zeitschr.f.
