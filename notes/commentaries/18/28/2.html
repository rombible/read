To confirm this, he showed of what a great deal of knowledge and wealth men may make themselves masters. The caverns of the earth may be discovered, but not the counsels of Heaven. Go to the miners, thou sluggard in religion, consider their ways, and be wise. Let their courage and diligence in seeking the wealth that perishes, shame us out of slothfulness and faint-heartedness in labouring for the true riches. How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! How much easier, and safer! Yet gold is sought for, but grace neglected.

The Mexicans were ignorant of the use of iron, though ornaments of gold and silver elegantly worked abounded among them. Iron is less easily discovered than copper, though more abundant, and is worked with more difficulty. Among the ancient nations, copper was in general use long before iron; and arms, vases, statues, and implements of every kind were made of this metal alloyed and hardened with tin, before iron came into general use. Tubal Cain is indeed mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a> as the "instructor of every artificer in brass and iron," but no direct mention is made of iron arms <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a> or tools <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5</a>, until after the departure from Egypt. According to the Arundelian Marbles, iron was known one hundred and eighty-eight years before the Trojan war, about 1370 years B.C.; but Hesiod, Plutarch, and others, limit its discovery to a much later period. Homer, however, distinctly mentions its use, Iliad xxiii. 262:<p>&#x397; &#x3b4;&#x3b5; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c5;&#836;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#894;, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;.<p>He&#772; de gunaikas euzo&#772;nas, polion te side&#772;ron.<p>That by the "sideros" of the poet is meant iron, is clear, from a simile which he uses in the Odyssey, derived from the quenching of iron in water, by which he illustrates the hissing produced in the eye of Polyphemus by piercing it with the burning stake:<p>"And as when armorers temper in the ford<p>The keen edged pole-axe or the shining sword,<p>The red-hot metal hisses in the lake,<p>Thus in the eye-ball hissed the plunging stake."<p>Odyssey ix. 391; Pope<p>Iron is mentioned in the time of Og king of Bashan, 1450 B.C. It was at first, however, regarded as of great value, and its use was very limited. It was presented in the temples of Greece as among the most valuable offerings, and rings of iron have been found in the tombs of Egypt that had been worn as ornaments, showing the value of the metal. One of the reasons why this metal comes so slowly into use, and why it was so rare in early times, was the difficulty of smelting the ore, and reducing it to a malleable state "Its gross and stubborn ore," says Dr. Robertson (America, B. iv.) "must feel twice the force of fire, and go through two laborious pocesses, before it becomes fit for use." It was this fact which made it to Job such a proof of the wisdom of man that he had invented the process of making iron, or of separating it from the earthy portions in which it is found.<p>Is taken out of the earth - Margin, "dust." The form in which iron is found is too well known to need description. It is seldom, if ever, found in its purity, and the ore generally has so much the appearance of mere earth, that it requires some skill to distinguish them.<p>And brass - &#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;  nechu&#770;sha&#770;h. Brass is early and frequently mentioned in the Bible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-11.htm">Exodus 26:11</a>, et al.), but there is little doubt that copper is meant in these places. Brass is a compound metal, made of copper and zinc - containing usually about one third of the weight in zinc - and it is hardly probable that the art of compounding this was early known; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>. Dr. Good renders this, "And the rock poureth forth copper." Coverdale, "The stones resolved to metal." Noyes, "The stone is melted into copper." Prof. Lee, "Also the stone (is taken from the earth) from which one fuseth copper." The Hebrew is, literally," And stone is poured out &#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1511; copper." The Septuagint renders it, "And brass is cut like stones;" that is, is cut from the quarry. The word "stone" here in the Hebrew (&#1488;&#1489;&#1503;  'eben) means, doubtless, "ore" in the form of stone; and the fact mentioned here, that such ore is fused into the &#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; eht   nechu&#770;sha&#770;h, is clear proof that copper is intended. Brass is never found in ore, and is never compounded in the earth. A similar idea is found in Pliny, who probably uses the word "aes" to denote copper, as it is commonly employed in the ancient writings. Aes fit ex lapide aeroso, quem vocant Cadmiam; et igne lapides in nes solvantur. Nat. Hist. xxxiv. i. 22. On the general subject of ancient metallurgy, see Wilkinsoh's Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, vol. iii. chapter ix. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. brass&#8212;that is, copper; for brass is a mixed metal of copper and zinc, of modern invention. Iron is less easily discovered, and wrought, than copper; therefore copper was in common use long before iron. Copper-stone is called "cadmium" by Pliny [Natural History, 34:1; 36:21]. Iron is fitly said to be taken out of the "earth" (dust), for ore looks like mere earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Iron is taken out of the earth; </span> being made of earth, concocted by the heat of the sun into that hardness, and by miners digged out of the earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Brass; </span> or, <span class="ital">copper</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is molten out of the stone, </span> wherewith it is mixed and incorporated in the earth, and by fire and the art of the metallist it is separated from it, and taken out of it, as Pliny observes, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-1.htm" title="Furthermore Elihu answered and said,">Job 34:1</a>,10 36:27</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Iron is taken out of the earth,....

Iron was found in the hills of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>), in the trans-Jordanic region (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud,' 4:8. &sect; 2), in the sandstone of the Lebanon ('Hist. of Phoenicia,' p. 47), and in Egypt ('Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 93), probably also in many other places. It is scarcely ever found except in the shape of iron ore, and so has to be "taken out of the earth." And brass is molten out of the stone. By "brass" we must understand copper, since the amalgam brass is never found in a natural state. Copper was yielded abundantly in very early times by the mines which the Egyptians worked in the Sinaitic peninsula ('Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 93, 94). It was also obtainable from Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>), Cyprus ('Hist. of Phoenicia,' p. 311), and Armenia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>). Sometimes it is found pure, but generally in the shape of copper ore, which has to be "molten" for the pure metal to run off. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>19  He lieth down rich, and doeth it not again,<p>He openeth his eyes and-is no more.<p>20  Terrors take hold of him as a flood;<p>By night a tempest stealeth him away.<p>21  The east wind lifteth him up, that he departeth,<p>And hurleth him forth from his place.<p>22  God casteth upon him without sparing,<p>Before His hand he fleeth utterly away.<p>23  They clap their hands at him,<p>And hiss him away from his place.<p>The pointing of the text &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; is explained by Schnurr., Umbr., and Stick.: He goes rich to bed and nothing is taken as yet, he opens his eyes and nothing more is there; but if this were the thought intended, it ought at least to have been &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1504;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, since &#1500;&#1488; signifies non, not nihil; and Stickel's translation, "while nothing is carried away," makes the fut. instead of the praet., which was to be expected, none the more tolerable; also &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; can indeed signify to gather hastily together, to take away (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-4.htm">Isaiah 33:4</a>), when the connection favours it, but not here, where the first impression is that &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is the subj. both to &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; and to &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;. Bttcher's translation, "He lieth down rich and cannot be displaced," gives the words a meaning that is ridiculed by the usage of the language. On the other hand, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; can signify: and he is not conveyed away (comp. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-5.htm">Ezekiel 29:5</a>; but not <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>, where it signifies to be swept away, and also not <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-26.htm">Numbers 20:26</a>, where it signifies to be gathered to the fathers), and is probably intended to be explained after the pointing that we have, as Rosenm. and even Ralbag explain it: "he is not conveyed away; one opens his eyes and he is not;" or even as Schlottm.: "he is not conveyed away; in one moment he still looks about him, in the next he is no more;" but the relation of the two parts of the verse in this interpretation is unsatisfactory, and the preceding strophe has already referred to his not being buried. Since, therefore, only an unsuitable, and what is more, a badly-expressed thought, is gained by this reading, it may be that the expression should be regarded with Hahn as interrogative: is he not swept away? This, however, is only a makeshift, and therefore we must see whether it may not perhaps be susceptible of another pointing. Jerome transl.: dives cum dormierit, nihil secum auferet; the thought is not bad, but &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is wanting, and &#1500;&#1488; alone does not signify nihil.

In Hebrew, even when the narrative has reference to Egyptian matters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-23.htm">Genesis 41:23</a>), the &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; which comes from the Arabian desert is the destructive, devastating, and parching wind &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;.<p>(Note: In Syria and Arabia the east wind is no longer called qad&#305;&#770;m, but exclusively sharq&#305;&#770;ja, i.e., the wind that blows from the rising of the sun (sharq). This wind rarely prevails in summer, occurring then only two or three days a month on an average; it is more frequent in the winter and early spring, when, if it continues long, the tender vegetation is parched up, and a year of famine follows, whence in the Lebanon it is called semu&#770;m (&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), which in the present day denotes the "poisonous wind" ( equals  nesme musimme), but originally, by alliance with the Hebr. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;, denoted the "devastating wind." The east wind is dry; it excites the blood, contracts the chest, causes restlessness and anxiety, and sleepless nights or evil dreams. Both man and beast feel weak and sickly while it prevails. Hence that which is unpleasant and revolting in life is compared to the east wind. Thus a maid in Hauran, at the sight of one of my Damascus travelling companions, whose excessive ugliness struck her, cried: billa&#770;h, naha&#770;r el-jo&#770;m aqshar (Arab. 'qs&#780;r), wagahetni (Arab. w-jht&#775;n&#305;&#770;) sharq&#305;&#770;ja, "by God, it is an unhealthy day to-day: an east wind blew upon me."
