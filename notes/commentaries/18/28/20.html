Who can show us where it lies, that we may go and search for it? By a diligent prosecution of this inquiry he brings us at length to this issue: That there is a two-fold wisdom; one <span class="ital">hid in God, </span>which is secret, and belongs not to us; the other made known by him, and revealed to man, which <span class="ital">belongs to us and to our children. It is hid from the eyes of all living — </span>Of all men that live upon the earth. <span class="ital">And kept close from the fowls of the air — </span>Though they fly high, and can see far and clearly, they cannot discern this: men of the most exalted and comprehensive minds, of the most enlarged and elevated understanding, cannot discover it: however acute their discernment may be, and however high their thoughts may soar, yet they cannot rise to this height, they cannot comprehend this. The line and plummet of human reason can never fathom the abyss of the divine counsels. Who can account for the maxims, measures, and methods of God’s government? Let us then be content, not to know the future events of Providence, till time discovers them; and not to know the secret reasons of Providence, till eternity brings them to light.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:20-28 There is a two-fold wisdom; one hid in God, which is secret, and belongs not to us; the other made known by him, and revealed to man. One day's events, and one man's affairs, have such reference to, and so hang one upon another, that He only, to whom all is open, and who sees the whole at one view, can rightly judge of every part. But the knowledge of God's revealed will is within our reach, and will do us good. Let man look upon this as his wisdom, To fear the Lord, and to depart from evil. Let him learn that, and he is learned enough. Where is this wisdom to be found? The treasures of it are hid in Christ, revealed by the word, received by faith, through the Holy Ghost. It will not feed pride or vanity, or amuse our vain curiosity. It teaches and encourages sinners to fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, in the exercise of repentance and faith, without desiring to solve all difficulties about the events of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whence then cometh wisdom? - This question is now repeated from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-12.htm">Job 28:12</a>, in order to give it greater emphasis.

The preceding verses indicated that Wisdom cannot be acquired by man though he should bid for it the most precious things that he possesses, in other words that it is unattainable; these verses state that idea again explicitly. The question <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-20.htm" title="From where then comes wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?">Job 28:20</a></span> implies a negative answer—nowhere by man.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whence then cometh wisdom?</span> and where is the place of understanding? This is a repetition of ver. 12, with a mere variant of the verb in the first line. Job's elaborate inquiry of vers. 14-19 having thresh no light on the subject, the original question recurs - Where does wisdom come from? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13  A mortal knoweth not its price,<p>And it is not found in the land of the living.<p>14  The abyss saith: It is not in me,<p>And the sea saith: It is not with me.<p>15  Pure gold cannot be given for it,<p>And silver cannot be weighed as its price;<p>16  And it is not outweighed with fine gold of Ophir,<p>With the precious onyx and the sapphire.<p>It is self-evident that wisdom is found nowhere directly present and within a limited space, as at the bottom of the sea, and cannot be obtained by a direct exchange by means of earthly treasures. It is, moreover, not this self-evident fact that is denied here; but the meaning is, that even if a man should search in every direction through the land of the living, i.e., (as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>) the world - if he should search through the &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;, i.e., the subterranean waters that feed the visible waters (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-25.htm">Genesis 39:25</a>) - if he should search through the sea, the largest bounded expanse of this water that wells up from beneath - yea, even if he would offer all riches and precious things to put himself in possession of the means and instruments for the acquirement of wisdom, - wisdom, i.e., the profoundest perception of the nature of things, would still be beyond him, and unattainable. &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-13.htm">Job 28:13</a>, an equivalent (from &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, to range beside, to place at the side of), interchanges with &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512; (from &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;, cogn. &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;, &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;, mercari). &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; is &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a> and freq., which hardly signifies gold shut up  equals  carefully preserved, rather: closed  equals  compressed, unmixed; Targ. &#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489; &#1505;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, aurum colatum (purgatum). Ewald compares Arab. sajara, to seethe, heat; therefore: heated, gained by smelting. On the other hand, &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; from &#1499;&#1514;&#1501;, Arab. ktm, occulere, seems originally to denote that which is precious, then precious gold in particular, lxx &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3a9;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;, Cod.

Sinaiticus, &#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1; (Egyptized by prefixing the Egyptian sa, part, district, side, whence e.g., sa-rees, the upper country, and sa-heet, the lower country, therefore  equals  sa-ofir, land of Ophir). &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; is translated here by the lxx &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be; (elsewhere &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be; or &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), of which Pliny, h. n. xxxvii. 6, 24, appealing to Sudeines, says, in gemma esse candorem unguis humanii similitudinem; wherefore Knobel, Rdiger, and others, compare the Arab. sa&#770;him, which, however, does not signify pale, but lean, and parched by the heat, with which, in hot countries at least, not pallor, but, on the contrary, a dark brown-black colour, is identified (Fl.). Arab. musahham, striped (Mich.), would be more appropriate, since the onyx is marked through by white veins; but this is a denom. from sahm, a dart, prop. darted, and is therefore wide of the mark.

Nevertheless both &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; are perhaps foreign names, as the name of the emerald (vid., ib. p. 108), which is Indian (Sanskr. marakata, or even marakta); and, on the other hand, it is called in hieroglyph (determined by the stone) uot, the green stone (in Coptic p. auanne&#772;se, the green colour) (Lauth).<p>The transcendent excellence of wisdom above the most precious earthly treasures, which the author of the introduction to the book of Proverbs briefly describes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-14.htm">Job 3:14</a>, is now drawn out in detail. </body></html>
