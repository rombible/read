Its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be bought with money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so in ours. Job asks after it as one that truly desired to find it, and despaired of finding it any where but in God; any way but by Divine revelation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But where shall wisdom be found? - That is, the full understanding of the plans of God - for this is the point of inquiry. The object of Job is to show that it is not to be found in the most profound science; by penetrating to the farthest extent of which man was capable in the earth, nor by any human investigations whatever. None of these things revealed the great plans of the Almighty in reference to his moral government, and particularly to the points which engrossed the attention of Job and his friends. Where true wisdom is to be found he proceeds to state in the subsequent verses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Can man discover the Divine Wisdom by which the world is governed, as he can the treasures hidden in the earth? Certainly not. Divine Wisdom is conceived as a person (Job 28:12-27) distinct from God (Job 28:23; also in Pr 8:23, 27). The Almighty Word, Jesus Christ, we know now, is that Wisdom. The order of the world was originated and is maintained by the breathing forth (Spirit) of Wisdom, unfathomable and unpurchasable by man. In Job 28:28, the only aspect of it, which relates to, and may be understood by, man, is stated.<p>understanding&#8212;insight into the plan of the divine government.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wisdom, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">that wisdom</span>; for here is an article which seems to be emphatical. The sense is, I confess that man hath one kind of wisdom in a great measure, to wit, to discover the works of nature, and to perform the operations of art; but as for that sublime and eminent wisdom, which consists in the exact knowledge of all God’s counsels and ways, and of the several manners and reasons of his governing the world, and dealing with good and bad men, this is far above man’s reach, and is the prerogative of God alone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Where is the place of understanding?</span> there is no vein for that upon the earth, as there is for gold or silver. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But where shall wisdom be found?.... Though there is a vein for silver, a track where that lies, and is to be come at, and a place where gold is found, and where it may be refined, and parts of the earth, out of which brass and iron, and bread corn, may be produced, and even from whence may be fetched brilliant gems and precious stones; which, though attended with many difficulties, in cutting through rocks, draining rivers, and restraining the waters, yet are got over through the art and skill, industry, diligence, and labour of men; so that their eyes behold every precious thing their minds desire, and they bring to light what have been laid up in darkness from the creation of the world: but, though these things may be found by search and labour, the question is, what vein is there for wisdom, or where is the place in which that may be found? by which may be meant the wisdom of God, as a perfection in him; which, though displayed in some measure in the works of creation and providence, yet not completely, and especially in his dealings with the children of men; in all which there is undoubtedly the wisdom of God; yet it is such a depth as is unfathomable by mortals: such are God's dealings with men in a way of distinguishing grace and mercy, as that he should take no notice of any of the whole body of apostate angels that sinned against him, but doomed them all to destruction; and yet there should be a philanthropy, a love of men in him, and such as to give his Son to die for them, and redeem them from ruin and destruction; also that he should make a difference among men, and ordain some to eternal life, while others are foreordained to condemnation and death, when all were in the same situation, condition, and circumstances; and such likewise were his dealings with the Israelites, and other nations of the world, part of which Job was not a stranger to; as his choosing them to be his peculiar people before all others, and bestowing peculiar favours upon them, not because they were more in quantity, or better in quality, but because this was his pleasure; when he suffered all other nations to walk in their own ways, for many hundreds of years, and winked at the times of their ignorance; and yet, after a long course of time, rejected the people of the Jews, and wrote a "loammi", or "not my people", <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a>, on them, and took out from the Gentiles a people for his name; so that they, who were not a people, were called the people of God, and the Jews were broken off, and the Gentiles grafted in; and when the fulness of them is brought in, there will be a turn again, and then all Israel shall be saved: upon all which the apostle breaks out in this exclamation, which may serve as a comment on this text, "oh the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>; particularly here may be meant the wisdom of God in his dealings with men, good and bad, in afflicting good men, and in suffering the wicked to prosper: this is a fact Job had fully proved, and it cannot be denied; and there is, no doubt, much of the wisdom of God herein; he does all things well and wisely; as he cannot do an unjust thing, so neither an unwise one; though his wisdom is unsearchable, his judgments are a great deep, and not to be fathomed by men, not only not by weak men and wicked men, but even by the wisest and best of men, as Asaph and Jeremiah: and this being the case, Job suggests to his friends, that the dealings of God with him, and the reasons of them, and his wisdom in them, were not to be searched out by them; and that they should forbear imputing his afflictions to hypocrisy, or to secret sins indulged by him; but to leave all, without making rash censures and wrong constructions, until the time should come when the judgments of God should be made manifest; such wisdom and knowledge, as to account for God's different dealings with men, being too wonderful, too high to attain unto, and quite out of their reach. The Jews, as particularly Jarchi, understand by wisdom the law, not to be found in the depth or in the sea; and illustrate the words by <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11</a>; but it is much better to interpret it of the Gospel, to which the apostle applies the above passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>; in which there is a glorious display of the wisdom of God, in all the truths and doctrines of it; that it is a mysterious wisdom, hidden wisdom, hid from the wise and prudent, and not to be attained unto by the light nature and carnal reason; it contains the deep things of God, which the Spirit of God alone searches and reveals; but why may not Christ, the Wisdom of God, be thought of? since many things are said in the following verses, as are of Wisdom, as a divine Person, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>; in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid, and on whom the spirit of wisdom and counsel rests, as Mediator; and who, as a divine Person, is the only wise God, and our Saviour: and to this question in Job's time, "where shall wisdom be found?" the only answer to be given is, that he, the Logos, or Wisdom, was with God, as one brought up with him, rejoicing always before him and that he lay in his bosom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-30.htm">Proverbs 8:30</a>; and to the same question in our time it must be returned, that he is in heaven at the right hand of God; but that there is no coming at the true knowledge of him by the light of nature, or by the law of Moses, but by means of the Gospel, and through the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. The first of these senses, respecting the wisdom of God in his different dealings with men, good and bad, is most generally given into by interpreters, and seems to suit well with the preceding dispute between Job and his friends: but if we look forward in the chapter, we shall find this question repeated, and an answer given to it as in the negative, so in the affirmative, that God knows the place of it; that he has searched it out, seen it, and declared it; and it is this, "the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding", <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-20.htm">Job 28:20</a>; by which it should seem, that this wisdom is supernatural wisdom, or understanding in men; which lies in the fear of God, and the effects of it; in a spiritual knowledge of God and Christ, or of God in Christ; and in that godliness which is profitable in all things; and in that wisdom which comes from above, and is opposed to that which is earthly, sensual, and devilish, and is not to be found in carnal hearts, nor its worth known by carnal men, nor to be obtained by any thing in nature ever so valuable, but is the gift of God, the wisdom he makes men to know, in the hidden part, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>; <p>and where is the place of understanding? to attain to the understanding of the mysteries of Providence, or of Christ, or of the Gospel; or to have a spiritual understanding of divine things, and experience of them, which only is the gift of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>; for, by wisdom and understanding are meant one and the same, as they often are, whether understood as a thing or person; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But where shall wisdom be found? <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> and where <i>is</i> the place of understanding?</span><p>(h) Though God's power and wisdom may be understood in earthly things, yet his heavenly wisdom cannot be attained to.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12–14</span>. The precious ores and costly stones though hidden have a place where they may be found, and man knows how to reach it and bring that which is hid to light, but where can Wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? It has no place and is unattainable by man; it is not to be found in the land of the living, in the deep nor in the sea.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-28.</span> - Here we come on an abrupt change. From human ingenuity and contrivance Job turns to the consideration of "wisdom"  -  that wisdom which has been defined as "the reason which deals with principles "(Canon Cook). "Where," he asks, "is this to be found?" It is a wholly different thing from cleverness and ingenuity. It inquires into causes and origins, into the ends and purposes of things; it seeks to solve the riddle of the universe. Perfect wisdom can, of course, only dwell with God (ver. 23). Man must be content with something much below this. With him "the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding" (ver. 28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But where shall wisdom be found?</span> "Wisdom is the principal thing," says Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>); and again, "It is better to get wisdom than gold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>). But where is it to be found? Job's three friends thought that it dwelt with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>); but this was a mistake, since God reproaches them with their "folly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>). Job does not claim to possess it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>); he only desires it. It is his deep conviction that it is only possessed, in the true sense of the word, by God. <span class="cmt_word">And where is the place of understanding?</span> It is not quite clear whether Job intends to make any distinction between "wisdom" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5db;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span>) and "understanding" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>). Canon Cook suggests that "wisdom" is "the reason which deals with principles," and "understanding" "the faculty which discerns and appreciates their application." But refined distinctions of this kind are scarcely suitable to the age of Job. Dean Plumptre, in his comment on Proverbs ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 529), accepts the distinction implied in the Septuagint translation of that book, which renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5db;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>' and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. This is a much simpler and more easily understood distinction, being that which separates between scientific know. ledge and the practical intelligence which directs conduct. But it may be doubted  whether Job does not use the two words as synonyms. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  5  The earth-from it cometh forth bread,<p>And beneath it is turned up like fire.<p>  6  The place of the sapphire are its stones,<p>And it containeth gold ore.<p>  7  The way, that no bird of prey knoweth,<p>And the eye of the hawk hath not gazed at,<p>  8  Which the proud beast of prey hath not trodden,<p>Over which the lion hath not walked.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-5.htm">Job 28:5</a> is not to be construed as Rosenm.: ad terram quod attinet, ex qua egreditur panis, quod subtus est subvertitur quasi igne; nor with Schlottm.: (they swing) in the earth, out of which comes bread, which beneath one turns about with fire; for <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-5.htm">Job 28:5</a> is not formed so that the Waw of &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; could be Waw apod., and &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; cannot signify "in the interior of the earth" as locativus; on the contrary, it stands in opposition to &#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, that which is beneath the earth, as denoting the surface of the earth (the proper name of which is &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;, from the root &#1491;&#1501;, with the primary notion of a flat covering). They are two grammatically independent predicates, the first of which is only the foil of the other: the earth, out of it cometh forth bread (&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>), and beneath it (the surface of the earth)  equals  that which lies beneath it (&#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; only virtually a subj. in the sense of &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; occurs only as a preposition), is turned about (comp. the construction of the sing. of the verb with the plur. subj. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>) as (by) fire Instar ignis, scil. subvertentis); i.e., the earth above furnishes nourishment to man, but that not satisfying him, he also digs out its inward parts (comp. Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. proaem.: in sede Manium opes quaerimus, tanquam parum benigna fertilique quaqua calcatur), since this is turned or tossed about (comp. &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, the special word for the overthrow of Sodom by fire) by mining work, as when fire breaks out in a house, or even as when a volcanic fire rumbles within a mountain (Castalio: agunt per magna spatia cuniculos et terram subeunt non secus ac ignis facet ut in Aetna et Vesuvio). The reading &#1489;&#1502;&#1493; (Schlottm.) instead of &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; is natural, since fire is really used to blast the rock, and to separate the ore from the stone; but, with the exception of Jerome, who has arbitrarily altered the text (terra, de qua oriebatur panis in loco suo, igni subversa est), all the old translations reproduce &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;, which even Nasse, in opposition to von Veltheim, thinks suitable: Man's restless search, which rummages everything through, is compared to the unrestrainable ravaging fire.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-6.htm">Job 28:6</a> also consists of two grammatically independent assertions: the place (bed) of the sapphire is its rock. Must we refer &#1500;&#1493; to &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, and translate: "and it contains fine dust of gold" (Hirz., Umbr., Stick., Nasse)? It is possible, for Theophrastus (p. 692, ed. Schneider) says of the sapphire it is &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, as it were covered with gold dust or grains of gold; and Pliny, h. n. xxxvii. 9, 38f.: Inest ei (cyano) aliquando et aureus pulvis qualis in sapphiris, in iis enim aurum punctis conlucet, which nevertheless does not hold good of the proper sapphire, but of the azure stone (lapis lazuli) which is confounded with it, a variegated species of which, with gold, or rather with iron pyrites glittering like gold, is specially valued.<p>(Note: Comp. Quenstedt, Handbuch der Mineralogie (1863), S. 355 and 302.)<p>But Schultens rightly observes: vix cerdiderim, illum auratilem pulvisculum sapphiri peculiari mentione dignum; and Schlottm.: such a collateral definition to &#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;, expressed in a special clause (not a relative one), has something awkward about it. On the other hand, &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is a perfectly suitable appellation of gold ore. "The earth, which is in itself black," says Diodorus in the passage quoted before, "is interspersed with veins of marble, which is of such pre-eminent whiteness, that its brilliance surpasses everything that glitters, and from it the overseers of the mine prepare gold with a large number of workmen." And further on, of the heating of this gold ore he says: "the hardest auriferous earth they burn thoroughly in a large fire; thus they make it soft, so that it can be worked by the hand." &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is a still more suitable expression for such auriferous earth and ore than for the nuggets of &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (i.e., unsmelted) of the size of a chestnut, which, according to Diodorus, ii. 50, are obtained in mines in Arabia (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). But it is inadmissible to refer &#1500;&#1493; to man, for the clause would then require to be translated: and gold ore is to him  equals  he has, while it is the rather intended to be said that the interior of the earth has gold ore. &#1500;&#1493; is therefore, with Hahn and Schlottm., to be referred to &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;: and this place of the sapphire, it contains gold. The poet might have written &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; but &#1500;&#1493; implies that where the sapphire is found, gold is also found. The following &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; (with Dech), together with the following relative clause, is connected with &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, or even with &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, which through <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-6.htm">Job 28:6</a> is become the chief subj.: the place of the sapphire and of the gold is the rock of the bowels of the earth, - a way, which, etc., i.e., such a place is the interior of the earth, accessible to no living being of the earth's surface except to man alone. The sight of the bird of prey, the &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., the hawk or kite, reaches from above far and wide beneath;<p>(Note: The &#1488;&#1497;&#1492; - says the Talmud b.
