It is round in various forms and sizes, and is composed of a great variety of substances. The common "rock crystal" is a general name for all the transparent crystals of quartz, particularly of limpid or colorless quartz. "Webster." The word used here (&#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1514;  zeku&#770;k&#305;&#770;yth) occurs nowhere else in the Bible. It is from &#1494;&#1499;&#1492;  za&#770;ka&#770;h, to be clean, pure; and is given to the crystal on account of its transparency. In Arabic the word means either glass or crystal. Jerome translates it, "vitrum" - glass; the Septuagint &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  hualos - crystal, or the "lapis crystallinus." Hesychius says that the crystal denotes &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  lampron kruos - "clear ice" or, &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  lithon timion - "a precious stone." There is no reason to suppose that "glass" was known so early as this, and the probability is that the word here denotes something like the rock crystal, having a strong resemblance to the diamond, and perhaps then regarded as nearly of equal value. It cannot be supposed that the relative value of gems was then understood as it is now.<p>Jewels of fine gold - Margin, "vessels." The Hebrew word &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;  kel&#305;&#770;y properly means vessels, or instruments. It may refer here, however, to ornaments for the person, as it was in that way chiefly that gold was employed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. crystal&#8212;Or else glass, if then known, very costly.

Crystal was found in an island of the Red sea, situated before Arabia, called Neron, and in another, which from a gem found in it bears the name of Topazion, and may be thought therefore to be well known by Job; and though it is not now of so much account, it formerly was very valuable. Pliny (a) makes mention of a crystal vessel, sold for 150,000 sesterces, about 1250 pounds sterling; and of two crystal cups broke by Nero in his fury, on hearing of some losses, to punish the then present age, that no other men might drink out of them: some render it "amber", which is found in Prussia, and being at a great distance from Job's country, might be the more valuable there; and Pliny (b) speaks of it as had in as great esteem as gems: the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin versions, and others, translate it "glass" (c) which had its original from Phoenicia, near Judea; so Pliny says (d) from the lake Cendevia, within the roots of Mount Carmel, in Phoenicia, near Judea, springs the river Belus, from whence glass came first; and he speaks of Sidon (a city in Phoenicia) as famous for it; and Tacitus (e) observes, that the river Belus glides in the Jewish sea, and about the mouth of it sand is gathered and mixed with nitre, and boiled into glass; and this being near the country where Job dwelt, it is thought be had knowledge of it; and from this passage some (f) have concluded the great antiquity of glass; and if it is true what Aelianus (g) relates, that when the monument of the ancient Belus (the first king of Babylon) was dug up by Xerxes, the son of Darius, that there was found a glass urn, where lay a body in oil, it must be in use before the times of Job. An Arabic chronologer (h) affirms what be had from men conversant in history, that in Egypt, after the flood, there were men learned in various sciences, and among the rest in alchemy, and had knowledge of burning glasses; though the invention of these, and of a glass globe, is ascribed to Archimedes (i), who lived somewhat later than two hundred years before Christ. There was great plenty of glass very early in Ethiopia, after mentioned, in which they enclosed their dead, that they might be seen through it (k); and if it was in use in Job's time, and especially if it was then a late invention, it might be highly valued, and therefore placed here with things of the greatest worth. In the times of Nero, Pliny says (l) two small glass cups were sold for six thousand sesterces, or forty five pounds sterling, and according to others near fifty pounds; and the same writer relates, that in the times of Tiberias an art was found out to make glass flexible and malleable; but was ordered to be destroyed, lest the value of gold, silver, and brass, should be lessened by it. The Targum renders the word here used a looking glass; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8</a>. Some think the diamond or adamant is meant, and others that it is a general name for all sorts of precious stones, they being clear, transparent, and lucid, as the word signifies: <p>and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold; set in fine gold; or "vessels" of it, more valuable than gold itself, being made of gold, purified, refined, and wrought by art into curious forms; and yet wisdom is so valuable as not to be exchanged for these. Mr. Broughton takes this fine gold, or gold of Phaz, to be the same with Fess in Barbary, which had its name from a heap of gold there found when its foundation was laid; for "fess" with the Arabs signifies gold (m). <p>(a) Ut supra, (Nat.

But Reimarus' translation: from the drops he connects the streams, is inadmissible. "The trickling water," he observes, "is carefully caught in channels by the miners for use, and is thus brought together from several parts of the reservoir and the water-wheel. What Pliny calls corrugus, corrivatio,." On the contrary, Schlottm. remarks that &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; cannot signify such a connection, i.e., gathering together of watercourses; it occurs elsewhere only of hunting, i.e., binding up wounds. Nevertheless, although &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; cannot directly signify "to collect," the signification coercere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a>), which is not far from this idea, - as is evident from the Arab. h&#803;ibs (h&#803;abs), a dam or sluice for collecting water, and Arab. mah&#803;bas 'l-ma&#770;', a reservoir, cistern, - is easily transferable to water, in the sense of binding  equals  catching up and accumulating. But it is contrary to the form of the expression that &#1502;&#1489;&#1499;&#1497;, with this use of &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;, should denote the materia ex qua, and that &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; should be referred to the miry ditches in which "the crushed ore is washed, for the purpose of separating the good from the worthless." On the contrary, from the form of the expression, it is to be translated: a fletu (not e fletu) flumina obligat, whether it be that a fletu is equivalent to ne flent s. stillent (Simeon Duran: &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;), or obligat equivalent to cohibet (Ralbag: &#1502;&#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;). Thus von Veltheim explains the passage, since he here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-10.htm">Job 28:10</a>, understands the channels for carrying off the water. "The miner covers the bottom with mire, and fills up the crevices so exactly i.e., he besmears it, where the channel is broken through, with some water-tight substance, e.g., clay, that it may entirely carry off the water that is caught by it out of the pit in which the shaft terminates, and not let it fall through the fissures crevices to the company of miners below to the vein that lies farther down; then the miner can descend still deeper since the water runs outwards and does not soak through, and bring forth the ore that lies below the channel." This explanation overlooks the fact that &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-10.htm">Job 28:10</a>, whereas <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-11.htm">Job 28:11</a> has &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;. It is not probable that these are only interchangeable expressions for the channels that carry off the water. &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is an appropriate expression for it, but not &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, which as appropriately describes the conflux of water in the mine itself.<p>The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-11.htm">Job 28:11</a> is, that he (the miner) binds or stops the watercourses which his working out of the pit has interfered with and injured, so that they may not leak, i.e., that they may not in the least ooze through, whether by building up a wall or by collecting the water that streams forth in reservoirs (Arab. mahbas) or in the channels which carry it outwards, - all these modes of draining off the water may be included in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-11.htm">Job 28:11</a>, only the channel itself is not, with von Veltheim, to be understood by &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, but the concourse of the water which, in one way or the other, is rendered harmless to the pit-work, so that he (the miner), as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-11.htm">Job 28:11</a> says, can bring to light (&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;  equals  &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;) whatever precious things the bowels of the earth conceals (&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, according to Kimchi and others, with euphonic Mappik, as according to the Masora &#1499;&#1489;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>, &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-24.htm">Ezekiel 22:24</a>, and also &#1493;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a>, only &#1500;&#1514;&#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;, i.e., they have Mappik only for euphony, not as the expression of the suff.).</body></html>
