Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour.

It does not penetrate it.<p>The spear, the dart - These were doubtless often used in the attempt to take the animal. The meaning is, that "they" would not hold or stick to the animal.

As offensive weapons cannot hurt him, so defensive weapons cannot secure a man from him. But men that go upon the design of taking either whales or crocodiles do not use to fortify themselves in that manner.

It is either broken by striking at him, or however cannot pierce him and stick in him; but since a sword is not used in fishery, rather the harpagon or harpoon may be meant, which cannot enter into the crocodile, being so fenced with scales; but the whale being struck with it, it enters deep into his flesh, and is wounded by it; wherefore this and what follows in the next verses seems best to agree with the crocodile, or some other fish; <p>the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon; that is, neither of these can fasten upon him or enter into him: and yet it is certain that the whale, after he has been struck and wounded by the harping-iron, men approach nearer to him and thrust a long steeled lance or spear under his gills into his breast, and through the intestines, which dispatches him: darts are not made use of in the whale fishery; and as for crocodiles, as Peter Martyr says (c), they are not to be pierced with darts: the habergeon, or coat of mail, being a defensive piece of armour, seems not to be designed, as being never used in taking such creatures; rather therefore a javelin or hand dart may be intended; since, as Bochart observes, in the Arabic language such an one is expressed by this word. <p>(c) Apud Bochart.

Herodotus, ii. 68, tells exactly the same story; as the special friend of the crocodile among little birds, he mentions &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (the sand-piper, Pluvianus Aegyptius).)<p>and in connection therewith the reflex action of sneezing may occur, since the light of the sun produces an irritation on the retina, and thence on the vagus; and since the sun shines upon the fine particles of watery slime cast forth in the act of sneezing, a meteoric appearance may be produced. This delicate observation of nature is here compressed into three words; in this concentration of whole, grand thoughts and pictures, we recognise the older poet. &#1506;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473; is the usual Semitic word for "sneezing" (Synon. &#1494;&#1512;&#1512;   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-35.htm">2 Kings 4:35</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; shortened from &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>, Hiph. of &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;.

But in the Ramesseum and elsewhere the crocodile appears with a head pointing upwards in company with couching lions, and the eyes of the crocodile are rendered specially prominent. Near this group it appears again in a curved position, and quite small, but this time in company with a scorpion which bears a disc of the sun. The former (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;) seems to me to be a figure of the longest night, the latter (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; in Horapollo) of the shortest, so that consequently &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; do not refer to the rising and setting of the sun, but to the night as prevailing against or succumbing to the day (communicated by Lauth from his researches on the astronomical monuments). But since the growth of the day begins with the longest night, and vice vers, the notions &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; can, as it seems to me, retain their most natural signification; and the crocodile's eyes are, notwithstanding, a figure of the light shining forth from the darkness, as the crocodile's tail signifies black darkness (and Egypt as the black land).)<p>for dawn, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; (probably to be read &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;) &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. There it is the peculiar brilliancy of the eyes of certain animals that is intended, which is occasioned either by the iris being furnished with a so-called lustrous substance, or there being in the pupil of the eye (as e.g., in the ostrich) that spot which, shining like metal, is called tapetum lucidum. For &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the eyes &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, is the lustre of the pupil in the depth of the eye. The eyes of the crocodile, which are near together, and slanting, glimmer through the water, when it is only a few feet under water, with a red glow.<p>Nevertheless the comparison in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-18.htm">Job 41:18</a> might also be intended differently.
