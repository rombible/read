Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will not conceal his parts - This is the commencement of a more particular description of the animal than had been before given. In the previous part of the chapter, the remarks are general, speaking of it merely as one of great power, and not to be taken by any of the ordinary methods. A description follows of the various parts of the animal, all tending to confirm this general impression, and to fill the hearer with a deep conviction of his formidable character. The words rendered, "I will not conceal," mean, "I will not be silent;" that is, he would speak of them. The description which follows of the "parts" of the animal refers particularly to his mouth, his teeth, his scales, his eyelids, his nostrils, his neck, and his heart.<p>Nor his comely proportion - The crocodile is not an object of beauty, and the animal described here is not spoken of as one of beauty, but as one of great power and fierceness. The phrase used here (&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; &#1495;&#1497;&#1503;  ch&#305;&#770;yn &#8219;e&#770;reko&#770;) means properly "the grace of his armature," or the beauty of his armor. It does not refer to the beauty of the animal as such, but to the armor or defense which it had. Though there might be no beauty in an animal like the one here described, yet there might be a "grace" or fitness in its means of defense which could not fail to attract admiration. This is the idea in the passage. So Gesenius, Umbreit, and Noyes render it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

On &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-27.htm">Job 6:27</a>. "When I came to the towns of the coast," says R. Akiba, b. Rosch ha-Schana, 26b, "they called selling, which we call &#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, there," according to which, then, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-5.htm">Genesis 50:5</a> is understood, as by the Syriac; the word is Sanscrito-Semitic, Sanscr. kri, Persic chir&#305;&#770;den (Jesurun, p. 178). lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-23.htm">2 Kings 6:23</a>, to which, however, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is not suitable. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are Phoenicians; and then, because they were the merchant race of the ancient world, directly traders or merchants. The meaning of the question is, whether one sells the crocodile among them, perhaps halved, or in general divided up. Further, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7</a> : whether one can kill it &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, with pointed missiles (Arab. shauke, a thorn, sting, dart), or with fish-spears (&#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;, so called from its whizzing, &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;, ). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-8.htm">Job 41:8</a> the accentuation is the right indication: only seize upon him - remember the battle, i.e., thou wilt be obliged to remember it, and thou wilt have no wish to repeat it. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; .ti t is a so-called imperat. consec.: if thou doest it, thou wilt ... , Ges. 130, 2. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; is the pausal form of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; (once &#834;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-6.htm">Proverbs 30:6</a>), of which it is the original form.<p>The suff. of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; refers to the assailant, not objectively to the beast (the hope which he indulges concerning it). &#1504;&#1499;&#1494;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-9.htm">Job 41:9</a>, is 3 praet., like &#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a> (where also the participial accenting as Milra, occurs in Codd.); Frst's Concord. treats it as part., but the participial form &#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492;, to be assumed in connection with it, along with &#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1514;, does not exist. &#1492;&#1490;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-9.htm">Job 41:9</a>, is, according to the sense, equivalent to &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1490;&#1501;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-4.htm">Job 20:4</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493; (according to Ges., Ew., and Olsh., sing., with the plural suff., without a plur. meaning, which is natural in connection with the primary form &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;; or what is more probable, from the plur. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; with a sing. meaning, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;) refers to the crocodile, and &#1497;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500; (according to a more accredited reading, &#1497;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1500;) to the hunter to whom it is visible.<p>What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-6.htm">Job 41:6</a> is perfectly true; although the crocodile was held sacred in some parts of Egypt, in Elephantine and Apollonopolis, on the contrary, it was salted and eaten as food. Moreover, that there is a small species of crocodile, with which children can play, does not militate against <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-5.htm">Job 41:5</a>. Everywhere here it is the creature in its primitive strength and vigour that is spoken of. But if they also knew how to catch it in very early times, by fastening a bait, perhaps a duck, on a barb with a line attached, and drew the animal to land, where they put an end to its life with a lance-thrust in the neck (Uhlemann, Thoth, S. 241): this was angling on the largest scale, as is not meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>. If, on the other hand, in very early times they harpooned the crocodile, this would certainly be more difficult of reconcilement with v. 31, than that mode of catching it by means of a fishing-hook of the greatest calibre with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>. But harpooning is generally only of use when the animal can be hit between the neck and head, or in the flank; and it is very questionable whether, in the ancient times, when the race was without doubt of an unmanageable size, that has now died out, the crocodile hunt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a>) was effected with harpoons. On the whole subject we have too little information for distinguishing between the different periods. So far as the questions of Jehovah have reference to man's relation to the two monsters, they concern the men of the present, and are shaped according to the measure of power which they have attained over nature. The strophe which follows shows what Jehovah intends by these questions. </body></html>
