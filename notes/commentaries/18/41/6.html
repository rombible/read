Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall thy companions make a banquet of him? - This is one of the "vexed passages" about which there has been much difference of opinion. Gesenius renders it, "Do the companions ("i. e." the fishermen in company) lay snares for him?" So Noyes renders it. Dr. Harris translates it, "Shall thy partners spread a banquet for him?" The Septuagint renders it, "Do the nations feed upon him?" The Vulgate, "Will friends cut him up?" that is, for a banquet. Rosenmuller renders it, "Will friends feast upon him?" The word rendered "thy companions" (&#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  chabba&#770;riym) means properly those joined or associated together for any purpose, whether for friendship or for business. It may refer here either to those associated for the purpose of fishing or feasting. The word "thy" is improperly introduced by our translators, and there is no evidence that the reference is to the companions or friends of Job, as that would seem to suppose. The word rendered "make a banquet" (&#1497;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;  yika&#770;ru&#770;) is from &#1499;&#1512;&#1492;  ka&#770;ra&#770;h, "to dig," and then to make a plot or device against one - derived from the fact that a "pitfall" was dug to take animals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-27.htm">Job 6:27</a>); and according to this it means, "Do the companions, "i. e." the fishermen in company, lay snares for him?" The word, however, has another signification, meaning to buy, to purchase, and also to give a feast, to make a banquet, perhaps from the idea of "purchasing" the provisions necessary for a banquet. According to this, the meaning is, "Do the companions, "i. e." those associated for the purpose of feasting, make a banquet of him?" Which is the true sense here it is not easy to determine. The majority of versions incline to the idea that it refers to a feast, and means that those associated for eating do not make a part of their entertainment of him. This interpretation is the most simple and obvious.<p>Shall they part him among the merchants? - That is, Shall they cut him up and expose him for sale? The word rendered "merchants" (&#1499;&#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  kena&#8219;an&#305;&#770;ym) means properly "Canaanites." It is used in the sense of "merchants, or traffickers," because the Canaanites were commonly engaged in this employment; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>. The crocodile is never made a part of a banquet, or an article of traffic. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

It is not meant that He reached His sword to behmoth, but (on which account &#1500;&#1493; is intentionally wanting) that He brought forth, i.e., created, its (behmoth's) peculiar sword, viz., the gigantic incisors ranged opposite one another, with which it grazes upon the meadow as with a sickle: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; (Nicander, Theriac. 566), &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; is exactly the sickle-shaped Egyptian sword (harpu  equals  &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;). Vegetable food (to which its teeth are adapted) is appointed to the behmoth: "for the mountains produce food for him;" it is the herbage of the hills (which is scanty in the lower and more abundant in the upper valley of the Nile) that is intended, after which this uncouth animal climbs (vid., Schlottm.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; is neither a contraction of &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (Ges.), nor a corruption of it (Ew.), but Hebraeo-Arab.  equals  baul, produce, from ba&#770;la, to beget, comp. aballa, to bear fruit (prop. seed, bulal), root &#1489;&#1500;, to soak, wet, mix.<p>(Note: Whether &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a>, signifies mixed provender (farrago), or perhaps ripe fruit, i.e., grain, so that jabol, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-21.htm">Judges 19:21</a>, in the signification "he gave dry provender consisting of barley-grain," would be the opposite of the jahushsh (&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;) of the present day, "he gives green provender consisting of green grass or green barley, hash&#305;&#770;sh," as Wetzst. supposes, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>.)<p>continued...</body></html>
