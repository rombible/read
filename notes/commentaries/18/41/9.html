Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, the hope of him is in vain - That is, the hope of taking him is vain.<p>Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? - So formidable is his appearance, that the courage of him who would attack him is daunted, and his resolution fails. This agrees well also with the crocodile. There is perhaps scarcely any animal whose appearance would be more likely to deter one from attacking him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. the hope&#8212;of taking him.<p>cast down&#8212;with fear "at the (mere) sight of him."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The hope of him; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Elsewhere, however, the crocodile is thus named, and in fact as &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; also, another appellation of this natural wonder of Egypt, as an emblem of the mightiness of Pharaoh (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>.), as once again the crocodile itself is called in Arab. el-fir&#8219;annu. The Old Testament language possesses no proper name for the crocodile; even the Talmudic makes use of &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488;  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Lewysohn, 271). &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is the generic name of twisted, and &#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; long-extended monsters. Since the Egyptian name of the crocodile has not been Hebraized, the poet contents himself in &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; with making a play upon its Egyptian, and in Arab. tmsa&#770;h&#803;, timsa&#770;h&#803;,<p>(Note: Herodotus was acquainted with this name (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;); thus is the crocodile called also in Palestine, where (as Tobler and Joh.
