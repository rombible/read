Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sharp stones are under him - Margin, as in Hebrew, "pieces of pot sherd." The Hebrew word (&#1495;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;  chaddu&#770;d), means "sharp, pointed"; and the phrase used here means "the sharp points of a potsherd," or broken pieces of earthenware. The reference is, undoubtedly, to the scales of the animal, which were rough and pointed, like the broken pieces of earthenware. This description would not agree with the whale, and indeed will accord with no other animal so well as with the crocodile. The meaning is, that the under parts of his body, with which he rests upon the mire, are made up of sharp, pointed things, like broken pottery.<p>He spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire - That is, when he rests or stretches himself on the mud or slime of the bank of the river. The word used here and rendered "sharp pointed things" (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509;  cha&#770;ru&#770;ts) means properly something "cut in;" then something sharpened or pointed; and is used to denote "a threshing sledge;" see this instrument described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27-28</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>, note. It is not certain, however, that there is any allusion here to that instrument. It is rather to anything that is rough or pointed, and refers to the lower part of the animal as having this character. The Vulgate renders this, "Beneath him are the rays of the sun, and he reposeth on gold as on clay." Dr. Harris, Dr. Good, and Prof. Lee, suppose it refers to what the animal lies on, meaning that he lies on splinters of rock and broken stone with as much readiness and ease as if it were clay. But the above seems to me to be the true interpretation. It is that of Gesenius, Rosenmuller, and Umbreit. Grotius understands it as meaning that the weapons thrown at him lie around him like broken pieces of pottery. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. stones&#8212;rather, "potsherds," that is, the sharp and pointed scales on the belly, like broken pieces of pottery.<p>sharp-pointed things&#8212;rather, "a threshing instrument," but not on the fruits of the earth, but "on the mire"; irony. When he lies on the mire, he leaves the marks of his scales so imprinted on it, that one might fancy a threshing instrument with its sharp teeth had been drawn over it (Isa 28:27).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> According to this translation the sense is, his skin is so hard and impenetrable, that the sharpest stones are as easy to him as the mire, and make no more impression upon him. But the words are and may be otherwise rendered, as continuing the former sense, They (to wit, the arrows, darts, or stones cast at him) are or fall <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">under him, </span> like (which particle is oft understood) <span class="ital">sharp shreds</span>, or <span class="ital">fragments of stones; </span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">he spreadeth sharp pointed things</span> (to wit, the pieces of swords or darts which were flung at him, and broken upon him) upon the mire. The fragments of broken weapons lie as thick at the bottom of the water in the place of the fight as little stones do in the mire, or as they do in a field after some fierce and furious battle. Or thus, <span class="ital">With him</span> (or <span class="ital">for him</span>, i.e. for his defence) <span class="ital">are sharp stones</span>; he spreadeth himself like <span class="ital">an arrow or threshing instrument</span> (which is filled and fortified with iron) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in the mire</span> or <span class="ital">mud</span> in the bottom of the water: so he doth not describe his resting-place, but rather his back, which he not unfitly compares to sharp stones or threshing instruments, because the darts or stones east at him pierce no more into him than they would do into them if they were thrown at them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Sharp stones are under him,....
