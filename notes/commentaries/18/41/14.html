Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour.

The same term is sti 1 used to denote the mouth - from its resemblance to a door. The idea is, that no one would dare to force open his mouth. This agrees better with the crocodile than almost any other animal. It would not apply to the whale. The crocodile is armed with a more formidable set of teeth than almost any other animal; see the description in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>. Bochart says that it has sixty teeth, and those much larger than in proportion to the size of the body. Some of them, he says, stand out; some of them are serrated, or like a saw, fitting into each other when the mouth is closed; and some come together in the manner of a comb, so that the grasp of the animal is very tenacious and fearful; see a full description in Bochart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. doors of &#8230; face&#8212;his mouth.

Of his mouth, the jaws thereof, which are like a pair of folding doors: the jaws of a crocodile have a prodigious opening. Peter Martyr (u) speaks of one, whose jaws opened seven feet broad; and Leo Africanus (w) affirms he saw some, whose jaws, when opened, would hold a whole cow. To the wideness of the jaws of this creature Martial (x) alludes; and that the doors or jaws of the mouth of the whale are of a vast extent will be easily believed by those who suppose that was the fish which swallowed Jonah; <p>his teeth are terrible round about; this may seem to make against the whale, the common whale having none; though the "ceti dentati" are a sort of whales that have many teeth in the lower jaw, white, large, solid, and terrible (y). Olaus Magnus (z) speaks of some that have jaws twelve or fourteen feet long; and teeth of six, eight, and twelve feet; and there is a sort called "trumpo", having teeth resembling those of a mill (a). In the spermaceti whale are rows of fine ivory teeth in each jaw, about five or six inches long (b). But of the crocodile there is no doubt; which has two rows of teeth, very sharp and terrible, and to the number of sixty (c). <p>(u) Decad. 5. c. 9. (w) Descript. Africae, l. 9. p. 763.

Who would dare to do so? His teeth are terrible round about. The crocodile has "two rows of sharply pointed teeth, thirty or more on each side" (Russell's 'Ancient and Modern Egypt,' p. 460). They are "so formed and disposed as to tear their prey rather than masticate it" ('Dict. Universelle des Sciences,' p. 447). The voracity of the full-grown crocodile is great; and he will not scruple to attack and devour men, if they come in his way. The natives of Upper Egypt have a wholesome terror of him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  6  Do fishermen trade with him,<p>Do they divide him among the Canaanites?<p>  7  Canst thou fill his skin with darts,<p>And his head with fish-spears?<p>  8  Only lay thy hand upon him<p>Remember the battle, thou wilt not do it again!<p>  9  Behold, every hope becometh disappointment:<p>Is not one cast down even at the sight of him?<p>The fishermen form a guild (Arab. s&#803;unf, sunf), the associated members of which are called &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (distinct from &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;). On &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-27.htm">Job 6:27</a>. "When I came to the towns of the coast," says R. Akiba, b. Rosch ha-Schana, 26b, "they called selling, which we call &#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, there," according to which, then, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-5.htm">Genesis 50:5</a> is understood, as by the Syriac; the word is Sanscrito-Semitic, Sanscr. kri, Persic chir&#305;&#770;den (Jesurun, p. 178). lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-23.htm">2 Kings 6:23</a>, to which, however, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is not suitable. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are Phoenicians; and then, because they were the merchant race of the ancient world, directly traders or merchants. The meaning of the question is, whether one sells the crocodile among them, perhaps halved, or in general divided up. Further, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7</a> : whether one can kill it &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, with pointed missiles (Arab. shauke, a thorn, sting, dart), or with fish-spears (&#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;, so called from its whizzing, &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;, ). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-8.htm">Job 41:8</a> the accentuation is the right indication: only seize upon him - remember the battle, i.e., thou wilt be obliged to remember it, and thou wilt have no wish to repeat it. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; .ti t is a so-called imperat. consec.: if thou doest it, thou wilt ... , Ges. 130, 2. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; is the pausal form of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; (once &#834;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-6.htm">Proverbs 30:6</a>), of which it is the original form.<p>The suff. of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; refers to the assailant, not objectively to the beast (the hope which he indulges concerning it). &#1504;&#1499;&#1494;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-9.htm">Job 41:9</a>, is 3 praet., like &#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a> (where also the participial accenting as Milra, occurs in Codd.); Frst's Concord. treats it as part., but the participial form &#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492;, to be assumed in connection with it, along with &#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1514;, does not exist. &#1492;&#1490;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-9.htm">Job 41:9</a>, is, according to the sense, equivalent to &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1490;&#1501;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-4.htm">Job 20:4</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493; (according to Ges., Ew., and Olsh., sing., with the plural suff., without a plur. meaning, which is natural in connection with the primary form &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;; or what is more probable, from the plur. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; with a sing. meaning, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;) refers to the crocodile, and &#1497;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500; (according to a more accredited reading, &#1497;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1500;) to the hunter to whom it is visible.<p>What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-6.htm">Job 41:6</a> is perfectly true; although the crocodile was held sacred in some parts of Egypt, in Elephantine and Apollonopolis, on the contrary, it was salted and eaten as food. Moreover, that there is a small species of crocodile, with which children can play, does not militate against <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-5.htm">Job 41:5</a>. Everywhere here it is the creature in its primitive strength and vigour that is spoken of. But if they also knew how to catch it in very early times, by fastening a bait, perhaps a duck, on a barb with a line attached, and drew the animal to land, where they put an end to its life with a lance-thrust in the neck (Uhlemann, Thoth, S. 241): this was angling on the largest scale, as is not meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>. If, on the other hand, in very early times they harpooned the crocodile, this would certainly be more difficult of reconcilement with v. 31, than that mode of catching it by means of a fishing-hook of the greatest calibre with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>. But harpooning is generally only of use when the animal can be hit between the neck and head, or in the flank; and it is very questionable whether, in the ancient times, when the race was without doubt of an unmanageable size, that has now died out, the crocodile hunt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a>) was effected with harpoons. On the whole subject we have too little information for distinguishing between the different periods. So far as the questions of Jehovah have reference to man's relation to the two monsters, they concern the men of the present, and are shaped according to the measure of power which they have attained over nature. The strophe which follows shows what Jehovah intends by these questions. </body></html>
