If thou canst not save thyself from them, how much less canst thou be saved without Me?” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-14.htm" title="Then will I also confess to you that your own right hand can save you.">Job 40:14</a>.) The first clause may be understood thus: “He is not so cruel (the common meaning of the word rendered <span class= "ital">fierce</span>)—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to himself—that he should venture to rouse him up.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/41.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>41:1-34 Concerning Leviathan. - The description of the Leviathan, is yet further to convince Job of his own weakness, and of God's almighty power. Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>None is so fierce that dare stir him up - No one has courage to rouse and provoke him.<p>Who then is able to stand before me? - The meaning of this is plain. It is, "If one of my creatures is so formidable that man dare not attack it, how can he contend with the great Creator? This may perhaps be designed as a reproof of Job. He had expressed a desire to carry his cause before God, and to urge argument before him in vindication of himself. God here shows him how hopeless must be a contest with the Almighty. Man trembles and is disarmed of his courage by even the sight of one of the creatures of God. Overpowered with fear, he retires from the contemplated contest, and flees away. How then could he presume to contend with God? What hope could he have in a contest with him? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. fierce&#8212;courageous.

This seems best to agree with the crocodile, who frequently lies down and sleeps on the ground (q), and in the water by night (r); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; when it is very dangerous to arouse him; and few, if any so daring, have courage enough to do it: though whales have been seen lying near shore asleep, and looked like rocks, even forty of them together (s); <p>who then is able to stand before me? This is the inference the Lord draws from hence, or the use he makes of it; that if this creature is so formidable and terrible, that it is dangerous to arouse and provoke him, and there is no standing before him or against him; then how should anyone be able to stand before the Lord, who made this creature, whenever he is angry? see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-7.htm">Psalm 76:7</a>. <p>(q) Plin. l. 8. c. 25.

Elsewhere, however, the crocodile is thus named, and in fact as &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; also, another appellation of this natural wonder of Egypt, as an emblem of the mightiness of Pharaoh (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>.), as once again the crocodile itself is called in Arab. el-fir&#8219;annu. The Old Testament language possesses no proper name for the crocodile; even the Talmudic makes use of &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488;  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Lewysohn, 271). &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is the generic name of twisted, and &#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; long-extended monsters. Since the Egyptian name of the crocodile has not been Hebraized, the poet contents himself in &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; with making a play upon its Egyptian, and in Arab. tmsa&#770;h&#803;, timsa&#770;h&#803;,<p>(Note: Herodotus was acquainted with this name (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;); thus is the crocodile called also in Palestine, where (as Tobler and Joh.
