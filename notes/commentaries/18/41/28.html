Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The arrow - Hebrew "the son of the bow."

It is not intended of actual stone-like hardness, but only of its indomitable spirit and great tenacity of life: the activity of its heart is not so easily disturbed, and even fatal wounds do not so quickly bring it to a stand. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1502;&#1493; from &#1513;&#1474;&#1514;  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;), primary form &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;, is better understood in the active sense: afraid of its rising, than the passive: of its exaltedness. &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (according to another reading &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;) is not, with Ew., to be derived from &#1488;&#1497;&#1500; (Arab. &#305;&#770;jal), a ram; but &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a> (comp. &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>, &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-29.htm">2 Samuel 22:29</a>), &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-11.htm">Ezekiel 31:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-21.htm">Ezekiel 32:21</a>, and &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; Cheth. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>, are only alternating forms and modes of writing of the participial adject., derived from &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;) first of all in the primary form awil (as &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;  equals  gawir). The signif. assigned to the verb &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;: to be thick  equals  fleshy, which is said then to go over into the signif. to be stupid and strong (Ges. Handwrterb.), rests upon a misconception: a&#770;la is said of fluids "to become thick," because they are condensed, since they go back, i.e., sink in or settle (Ges. correctly in Thes.: notio crassitiei a retrocendendo). The verb a&#770;la, ja'u&#770;lu, unites in itself the significations to go backward, to be forward, and to rule; the last two: anteriorem and superiorem esse, probably belong together, and &#1488;&#1500; signifies, therefore, a possessor of power, who is before and over others. &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-25.htm">Job 41:25</a>, has the signif., which does not otherwise occur, to miss the mark (from &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;, Arab. chat&#803;iya, to miss, opp. Arab. s&#803;a&#770;b, to hit the mark), viz., (which is most natural where &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is the subject spoken of) since they had designed the slaughter and capture of the monster. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is intended subjectively, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>, Targ.
