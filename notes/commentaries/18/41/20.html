Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke - See the quotations on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-19.htm">Job 41:19</a>. This appearance of the crocodile, or alligator, has been often noticed. Bertram, in his "Travels in North and South Carolina," p. 116, says, "While I was seeking a place of rest, I encountered an alligator that in the neighboring lake rushed through the canes that grew on its banks. He inflated his enormous body, and swung his tail high in the air. A thick smoke streamed from his wide-open nostrils, with a sound that made the earth tremble." Rosenmuller, "Alte u. neue Morgenland," No. 778.<p>As out of a seething-pot - A pot that is boiling. Literally, "a blown pot;" that is, a pot under which the fire is blown, or kindled.<p>Or caldron - Any kettle.
