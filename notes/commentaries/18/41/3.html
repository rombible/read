Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Will he make many supplications unto thee? - In the manner of a captive begging for his life.

The art. in &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is, without the pronominal suff. being meant as an accusative (Ew. 290, d), equal to a demonstrative pronoun (comp. Ges. 109, init): this its Creator (but so that "this" does not refer back so much as forwards). It is not meant that He reached His sword to behmoth, but (on which account &#1500;&#1493; is intentionally wanting) that He brought forth, i.e., created, its (behmoth's) peculiar sword, viz., the gigantic incisors ranged opposite one another, with which it grazes upon the meadow as with a sickle: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; (Nicander, Theriac. 566), &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; is exactly the sickle-shaped Egyptian sword (harpu  equals  &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;). Vegetable food (to which its teeth are adapted) is appointed to the behmoth: "for the mountains produce food for him;" it is the herbage of the hills (which is scanty in the lower and more abundant in the upper valley of the Nile) that is intended, after which this uncouth animal climbs (vid., Schlottm.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; is neither a contraction of &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (Ges.), nor a corruption of it (Ew.), but Hebraeo-Arab.  equals  baul, produce, from ba&#770;la, to beget, comp. aballa, to bear fruit (prop. seed, bulal), root &#1489;&#1500;, to soak, wet, mix.<p>(Note: Whether &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a>, signifies mixed provender (farrago), or perhaps ripe fruit, i.e., grain, so that jabol, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-21.htm">Judges 19:21</a>, in the signification "he gave dry provender consisting of barley-grain," would be the opposite of the jahushsh (&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;) of the present day, "he gives green provender consisting of green grass or green barley, hash&#305;&#770;sh," as Wetzst. supposes, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>.)<p>continued...</body></html>
