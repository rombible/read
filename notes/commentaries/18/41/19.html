The crocodile, says the naturalists, lying long under water, and being there forced to hold its breath, when it emerges, the breath, long repressed, is hot, and bursts out so violently that it resembles fire and smoke. The horse suppresses not his breath, by any means, so long, neither is he so fierce and animated; yet the most correct of poets venture to use the same metaphor concerning him. By this I would caution against a false opinion of the eastern boldness, (the boldness of their metaphors,) from passages in them ill understood.” We add the doctor’s paraphrase on these verses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“His bulk is charged with such a furious soul, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That clouds of smoke from his spread nostrils roll, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As from a furnace; and, when roused his ire, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Fate issues from his jaws in streams of fire.”</span></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Smoke, as out of a caldron — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">אגמן</span>, <span class="ital">agmon, </span>sometimes rendered <span class="ital">bulrush, </span>and, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm" title="Can you put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?">Job 41:2</a>, put for a <span class="ital">hook; </span>but the word likewise signifies a <span class="ital">pool, </span>or stagnating water, and is here rendered a <span class="ital">caldron, </span>because a caldron sends forth a great smoke, as a pool doth vapours. By a like figure, the great brazen laver, in the temple, was called a sea, on account of the great quantity of water which it contained. <span class="ital">His breath kindleth coals — </span>A hyperbolical expression, signifying only extraordinary heat.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/41.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>41:1-34 Concerning Leviathan. - The description of the Leviathan, is yet further to convince Job of his own weakness, and of God's almighty power. Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of his mouth go burning lamps - The word "lamps" here is probably used to denote torches, or fire-brands. The animal is here described as in pursuit of his prey on land; and the description is exceedingly graphic and powerful. His mouth is then open; his jaws are distended; his breath is thrown out with great violence; his blood is inflamed, and the animal seems to vomit forth flames. The description is of course to be regarded as figurative. It is such as one would be likely to give who should see a fierce animal pressing on in pursuit of its prey.<p>And sparks of fire leap out - There is an appearance like sparks of fire. The animal, with an open throat highly inflamed, seems to breathe forth flames. The figure is a common one applied to a war-horse. Thus, Ovid:<p>"From their full racks the generous steeds retire,<p>Dropping ambrosial foam and snorting fire."<p>Dr. Good<p>The same thing is remarked by Achilles Tatius, of the hippopotamus, "With open nostrils, and breathing smoke like fire (&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;  puro&#772;de&#772; kapnon) as from a fountain of fire." And in Eustathius it is said, "They have an open nostril, breathing forth smoke like fire from a furnace " - &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  puro&#772;de&#772; kapnon, ho&#772;s ek kaminou pneonta.

This also may seem better to agree to the crocodile, which breathes (as Aristotle affirms) like the hippopotamus, of which ancient authors affirm, <span class="ital">that his nostrils are very large, and he breathes forth a fiery smoke like that of a furnace</span>, than to the whale, which rather casts forth streams of water, as was noted before, than flames of fire, there being no such great heat observed in whales, nor, as far as I know, in any other fishes. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. Which, though hyperbolical expressions, have some foundation for them in the latter; in the vast quantities of water thrown out by the whale, through its mouth or hole in its frontispiece, which in the sun may look like lamps and sparks of fire, as before observed; and especially in the "orcae", or whales with teeth, which eject in the same way an oily mucus, or the fat liquor of the brain, commonly called spermaceti, which may appear more bright and glittering. Ovid (t) says much the same of the boar as is here said of the leviathan. <p>(t) "Fulmen ab ore venit; frondesque adflatibus ardent". Metamorph. c. 8.

The intention is to  represent the impression which the animal would make on an impressible but unscientific observer viewing it in its native haunts for the first time. Splashing, snorting, and throwing up spray all around, it would seem to be breathing out steam and smoke, from which the idea of fire is inseparable (see the next verse). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  I will not keep silence about his members,<p>The proportion of his power and the comeliness of his structure.<p>13  Who could raise the front of his coat of mail?<p>Into his double teeth-who cometh therein?<p>14  The doors of his face-who openeth them?<p>Round about his teeth is terror.<p>The Ker &#1500;&#1493; authorized by the Masora assumes an interrogative rendering: as to it, should I be silent about its members (&#1500;&#1493; at the head of the clause, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-7.htm">Leviticus 7:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>), - what perhaps might appear more poetic to many. &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (once, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/11-3.htm">Job 11:3</a>, to cause to keep silence) here, as usually: to be silent. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-13.htm">Job 18:13</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; signifies the relation of the matter, a matter of fact, as &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, facts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>. &#1495;&#1497;&#1503; (compared by Ew. with &#1492;&#1497;&#1503;, a measure) signifies grace, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (as synon. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;), here delicate regularity, and is made easy of pronunciation from &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, just as the more usual &#1495;&#1503;; the language has avoided the form &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, as observed above. &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; . clothing, we have translated "coat of mail," which the Arab. liba&#770;s usually signifies; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is not its face's covering (Schlottm.), which ought to be &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;; but &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is the upper or front side turned to the observer (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>), as Arab. wjh, (wag'h), si rem desuper spectes, summa ejus pars, si ex adverso, prima (Fleischer, Glossae, i. 57).
