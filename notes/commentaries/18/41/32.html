Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He maketh a path to shine after him - This refers doubtless to the white foam of the waters through which he passes. If this were spoken of some monster that commonly resides in the ocean, it would not be unnatural to suppose that it refers to the phosphoric light such as is observed when the waters are agitated, or when a vessel passes rapidly through them. If it refers, however, to the crocodile, the allusion must be understood of the hoary appearance of the Nile or the lake where he is found.<p>One would think the deep to be hoary - Homer often speaks of the sea as &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  polie&#772;n thalassan - "the hoary sea." So Apollonius, speaking of the Argonauts, Lib. i.:545:<p> - &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; - <p> - makrai d' aien eleukainonto keleuthoi - <p>"The long paths were always white"<p>So Catullus, in Epith.

Upon the sea, by raising a white from upon it, through its vehement motion as it passes along, or by the spermaceti it casts out and leaves behind it. It is said (s) that whales will cut and plough the sea in such a manner, as to leave a shining glittering path behind them, the length of a German mile, which is three of ours; <p>one would think the deep to be hoary; to be old and grey headed, or white like the hair of the head of an old man, a figure often used of the sea by poets (t); and hence "Nereus" (u), which is the sea, is said to be an old man, because the froth in the waves of it looks like white hair. <p>(s) Vid.

The Targ. supports this latter signification here (funda quae projicit lapidem); but since &#1511;&#1500;&#1488;, the handling, is mentioned separately, the word appears to men missiles in general, or the catapult. In this combination of weapons of attack it is very questionable whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; is a cognate form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;), a coat of mail; probably it is equivalent to Arab. sirwe (surwe), an arrow with a long broad edge (comp. ser&#305;&#770;je, a short, round, as it seems, pear-shaped arrow-head), therefore either a harpoon or a peculiarly formed dart.<p>(Note: On the various kinds of Egyptian arrows, vid., Klemm. Culturgeschichte, v. 371f.)<p>"The son of the bow" (and of the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, pharetra) is the arrow. That the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. &#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1495; signifies a club (war-club), is supported by the Arab. watacha, to beat. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, in distinction from &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; (a long lance), is a short spear, or rather, since &#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; implies a whistling motion, a javelin. Iron the crocodile esteems as &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503;, tibn, chopped straw; sling stones are turned with him into &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;. Such is the name here at least, not for stumps of cut stubble that remain standing, but the straw itself, threshed and easily driven before the wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-25.htm">Job 13:25</a>), which is cut up for provender (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-12.htm">Exodus 5:12</a>), generally dried (and for that reason light) stalks (e.g., of grass), or even any remains of plants (e.g., splinters of wood).<p>(Note: The Egyptio-Arabic usage has here more faithfully preserved the ancient signification of the word (vid., Fleischer, Glossae, p. 37) than the Syro-Arabic; for in Syria cut but still unthreshed corn, whether lying in swaths out in the field and weighted with stones to protect it against the whirlwinds that are frequent about noon, or corn already brought to the threshing-floors but not yet threshed, is called qashsh. - Wetzst.)<p>The plur. &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-29.htm">Job 41:29</a>, does not seem to be occasioned by &#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1495; being conceived collectively, but by the fact that, instead of saying &#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1495; &#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, the poet has formed &#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; into a separate clause. Parchon's (and Kimchi's) reading &#1514;&#1493;&#1495;&#1495; is founded upon an error. </body></html>
