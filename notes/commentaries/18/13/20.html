He depended upon God for justification and salvation, the two great things we hope for through Christ. Temporal salvation he little expected, but of his eternal salvation he was very confident; that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy, but his salvation, in the sight and enjoyment of whom he should be happy. He knew himself not to be a hypocrite, and concluded that he should not be rejected. We should be well pleased with God as a Friend, even when he seems against us as an enemy. We must believe that all shall work for good to us, even when all seems to make against us. We must cleave to God, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In a dying hour, we must derive from him living comforts; and this is to trust in him, though he slay us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Only do not two - things "unto me." The two things which are specified in the following verse. This is an address to God as Job argues his cause before him, and the request is, that he would remove every obstacle to his presenting his cause in the most favorable manner, and so that he may be on equal terms with him. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34-35</a>. He was ready to present his cause, and to plead before God, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18</a> he had the utmost confidence that he would be able so to present it as to vindicate himself; and he asks of God that he would withdraw his hand for a time <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a> and not terrify him <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, so that he could present his case with the full vigor of his mind and body, and so that he need not be overawed by the sense of the majesty and glory of the Most High. He wished to be free to present his cause without the impediments arising from a deeply distressing and painful malady. He wished to have his full intellectual and bodily vigor restored for a time to him, and then he was confident that he could successfully defend himself. He felt that, he was now enfeebled by disease, and incapacitated from making the effort for self-vindication and for maintaining his cause, which he would have been enabled to make in his palmy days.<p>Then will I not hide myself from thee - From God. I will stand forth boldly and maintain my cause. I will not attempt to conceal myself, or shun the trial and the argument.

This is an address not to Zophar as in the place of God, as to me, but to God himself; by this it appears, that though in modesty he does not mention him, yet he it is he has the chief, if not the sole regard unto in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-19.htm">Job 13:19</a>; for his desire was to speak to the Almighty, and reason with God, and have nothing more to do with his friends, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>; but before any pleadings begin on either side, he is desirous of settling and fixing the terms and conditions of the dispute; he requests that two things might be granted him, which are mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, <p>then will I not hide myself from thee; through fear or shame, but boldly appear before God, and come up even to his seat, and plead with him face to face. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20, 21</span>.

This is a proverbial phrase which does not occur elsewhere; for <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-2.htm">Jeremiah 38:2</a> (thy life shall become as spoil, &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;, to thee) is only similar in outward appearance. It may be asked whether <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-14.htm">Job 13:14</a> continues the question begun with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>): and wherefore should I take my soul in my hands, i.e., carefully protect it as a valuable possession? (Eichh., Umbr., Vaih.). But apart from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-109.htm">Psalm 119:109</a> (my soul is continually in my hand), - where it may be asked, whether the soul is not there regarded as treasure (according to the current religious phrase: to carry his soul in his hand  equals  to work out the blessedness of his soul with fear and trembling), - &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; signifies everywhere else (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-21.htm">1 Samuel 28:21</a>) as much as to risk one's life without fear of death, properly speaking: to fight one's way through with one's fist, perishing so soon as the strength of one's fist is gone (Ewald); comp. the expression for the impending danger of death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-66.htm">Deuteronomy 28:66</a>. If this sense, which is in accordance with the usage of the language, be adopted, it is unnecessary with Hirz., after Ewald, 352, b, to take &#1493;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; for &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1490;&#1501;: also, even my soul, etc., although it cannot be denied that &#1493;, like &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; and et, sometimes signifies: also, etiam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-7.htm">Isaiah 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-5.htm">2 Chronicles 27:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>, and according to the accents, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-6.htm">Hosea 8:6</a> also; on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>, can at least by explained by the copulative meaning, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a> by "and indeed"). The waw joins the positive to the negative assertion contained in the question of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-14.htm">Job 13:14</a> (Hahn): I will not eagerly make my flesh safe, and will take my soul in my hand, i.e., calmly and bravely expose myself to the danger of death. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a> is most directly connected with what precedes.</body></html>
