It is characteristic of Job that, living, as he probably did, outside the pale of Israel, he nevertheless shared the faith and knowledge of God’s chosen people; and this cannot be said of any other nation, nor docs any literature give evidence of it. Indeed, it is this which most markedly distinguishes Job from his friends, in that he can and does trust God unreservedly, in spite of all adverse circumstances, overwhelming as they were; while his friends are ignorant of the great central fact that He is Himself the sinner’s hope, and are content to rest only upon vague and bald generalities. It is because, therefore, he has said, and can say, “He is and will be my salvation,” that he can also say, “I know that I shall be justified, that I am righteous, because I trust in Him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm" title="And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.">Genesis 15:6</a>). We do not, in thus speaking, import the Gospel into Job, but exhibit that in Job which had already been manifest in Abraham, and probably recorded of him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-16.htm" title="He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.">Job 13:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">He also shall be my salvation — </span>I rest assured that he will save me out of these miseries, sooner or later, one way or other, if not with a temporal, yet with an eternal salvation after death; of which he speaks <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:">Job 19:25</a>. <span class="ital">For a hypocrite — </span>Or, rather, <span class="ital">But a hypocrite shall not come before him — </span>If I were a hypocrite, as you allege, I durst not present myself before him to plead my cause with him, as now I desire to do, nor could I hope for any salvation from or with him in heaven.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:13-22 Job resolved to cleave to the testimony his own conscience gave of his uprightness. He depended upon God for justification and salvation, the two great things we hope for through Christ. Temporal salvation he little expected, but of his eternal salvation he was very confident; that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy, but his salvation, in the sight and enjoyment of whom he should be happy. He knew himself not to be a hypocrite, and concluded that he should not be rejected. We should be well pleased with God as a Friend, even when he seems against us as an enemy. We must believe that all shall work for good to us, even when all seems to make against us. We must cleave to God, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In a dying hour, we must derive from him living comforts; and this is to trust in him, though he slay us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He also shalt be my salvation - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>. Literally, "He is unto me for salvation," that is, "I put my trust in him, and he will save me. The opportunity of appearing before God, and of maintaining my cause in his presence, will result in my deliverance from the charges which are alleged against me. I shall be able there to show that I am not a hypocrite, and God will become my defender."<p>For an hypocrite shall not come before him - This seems to be a proverb, or a statement of a general and indisputable principle. Job admitted this to be true. Yet he expected to be able to vindicate himself before God, and this gould prove that he was not an hypocrite - on the general principle that a man who was permitted to stand before God and to obtain his favor, could not be an unrighteous man. To God he looked with confidence; and God, he had no doubt, would be his defender. This fact would prove that he could not be an hypocrite, as his friends maintained. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Job, though he asserted the integrity of his heart and life, yet did not depend on his ways and works for salvation, but only on the Lord himself; this is to be understood not of temporal salvation, though God is the author of that, and it is only to be had of him, yet Job had no hope concerning that; but of spiritual and eternal salvation, which God the Father has contrived, determined, and resolved on, and sent his Son to effect; which Christ being sent is the author of by his obedience, sufferings, and death; and in him, and in his name alone, is salvation; and every soul, sensible of the insufficiency of himself and others to save him, will resolve, as Job here, that he, and he only, shall be his Saviour, who is an able, willing, and complete one; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-3.htm">Hosea 14:3</a>; and the words are expressive of faith of interest in him. Job knew him to be his Saviour, and living Redeemer, and would acknowledge no other; but claim his interest in him, now and hereafter, and which was his greatest support under all his troubles; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a>; <p>for an hypocrite shall not come before him; a hypocrite may come into the house of God, and worship him externally, and seem to be very devout and religious; and he shall come before the tribunal of God, and stand at his bar, to be tried and judged; but he shall not continue in the presence of God, nor enjoy his favour, or he shall not be able to make his cause good before him; and indeed he does not care to have himself examined by him, nor shall he be saved everlastingly, but undergo the most severe punishment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-51.htm">Matthew 24:51</a>. Job here either has respect to his friends, whom he censures as hypocrites, and retorts the charge upon they brought on him; or he has reference to that charge, and by this means clears himself of it, since there was nothing he was more desirous of than to refer his case to the decision of the omniscient God, and righteous Judge; which if he was an hypocrite he would never have done, since such can never stand so strict and severe an examination. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He also <i>shall be</i> my salvation: for an <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> hypocrite shall not come before him.</span><p>(f) By which he declares that he is not a hypocrite as they charged him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">He also shall be</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">this also</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for a hypocrite shall not</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">that a godless man will not</span>; see on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-13.htm" title="So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:">Job 8:13</a>. A godless man will not dare to go before God; but Job dares and desires; and this courage, sweet evidence to himself of his innocence, he says will be his salvation, that is, will secure him victory in his plea with God. He hardly distinguishes between his own consciousness of innocence and his innocence itself and the proof of it. He is so conscious of it that he is sure it will appear before God, cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-18.htm" title="Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.">Job 13:18</a></span> and the passage ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm" title="For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his soul?">Job 27:8</a> foll.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He also shall be my Salvation</span>. Whatever God does to him (ver. 13), whatever burden he lays upon him, though he even "slay" him (ver. 15), yet Job is sure that ultimately, in one way or another, God will be his Salvation. It is this determined trustfulness which at once gives Job's character its strength, and atones in a certain sense for his over-boldness in challenging God to a controversy. His heart is right with God. Though the secrets of the unseen world have been hidden from him, and the condition of man after death is a mystery on which he can only form vague conjectures, yet he is sure that in the end God will not fail him. <span class="cmt_word">For an hypocrite shall not come before him</span>. If he were a hypocrite the case would be different; he would tremble before God, instead of feeling confident. But, knowing that he is honest and true, he is not afraid; he is bold to "come before him," and plead his cause before him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Will ye speak what is wrong for God, <p>And speak what is deceitful for Him?<p>  8  Will ye be partial for Him,<p>Or will ye play the part of God's advocates?<p>  9  Would it be pleasant if He should search you out,<p>Or can ye jest with Him, as one jesteth with men?<p>10  He will surely expose you<p>If ye secretly act with partiality.<p>11  Will not His majesty confound you,<p>And His fear fall upon you?<p>Their advocacy of God - this is the thought of this strophe - is an injustice to Job, and an evil service rendered to God, which cannot escape undisguised punishment from Him. They set themselves up as God's advocates (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, like &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-31.htm">Judges 6:31</a>), and at the same time accept His person, accipiunt (as in acceptus  equals  gratus), or lift it up, i.e., favour, or give preference to, His person, viz., at the expense of the truth: they are partial in His favour, as they are twice reminded and given to understand by the fut. energicum &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;. The addition of &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-10.htm">Job 13:10</a>) implies that they conceal their better knowledge by the assumption of an earnest tone and bearing, expressive of the strongest conviction that they are in the right. They know that Job is not a flagrant sinner; nevertheless they deceive themselves with the idea that he is, and by reason of this delusion they take up the cause of God against him. Such perversion of the truth in majorem Dei gloriam is an abomination to God. When He searches them, His advocates, out (&#1495;&#1511;&#1512;, as Prov.Job 28:11), they will become conscious of it; or will God be mocked, as one mocketh mortal men? Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> for a similar thought. &#1495;&#1514;&#1500; is inf. absol. after the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is also to be derived from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;, and is fut. Hiph., the preformative not being syncopated, for &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (Ges. 53, rem. 7); not Piel, from &#1492;&#1514;&#1500; (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>), with the doubling of the middle radical resolved (Olsh. in his Lehrb. S. 577). God is not pleased with &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>) which gives the honour to Him, but not to truth, such &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>), such advocacy contrary to one's better knowledge and conscience, in which the end is thought to sanctify the means. Such advocacy must be put to shame and confounded when He who needs no concealment of the truth for His justification is manifest in His &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, i.e., not: in the kindling of His wrath (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>), but: in His exaltation (correctly by Ralbag: &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;), and by His direct influence brings all untruth to light. It is the boldest thought imaginable, that one dare not have respect even to the person of God when one is obliged to lie to one's self. And still it is also self-evident. For God and truth can never be antagonistic. </body></html>
