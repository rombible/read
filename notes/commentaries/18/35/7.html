They are far above us, and God is far above them; how much then is he out of the reach, either of our sins or of our services! We have no reason to complain if we have not what we expect, but should be thankful that we have better than we deserve.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? - The same sentiment substantially as in the previous verses. It is, that God is supreme and independent. He does not desire such benefits from the services of his friends and is not so dependent on them; as to be induced to interpose in their favor, in any way beyond what is strictly proper. It is to be presumed, therefore, that he will deal with them according to what is right, and as it is right that they should experience proofs of his favor, it followed that there "would be" advantage in serving him, and in being delivered from sin; that it "would be" better to be holy than to lead a life of transgression. This reasoning seems to be somewhat abstract, but it is correct, and is as sound now as it was in the time of Elihu. There is no reason why God should not treat people according to their character. He is not so under obligations to his friends, and has not such cause to dread his foes; he does not derive so much benefit from the one, or receive such injury from the other, that he is under any inducement to swerve from strict justice; and it follows, therefore, that where there ought to be reward there will be, where there ought to be punishment there will be, and consequently that there is an advantage in being righteous. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

All righteousness is of God that any creatures have. What the angels in heaven have, or Adam had in a state of innocence; or what believers in Christ have in and from him; his righteousness imputed to them is of God; the grace of righteousness, or holiness, imparted to them and implanted in them, is from him; and it is under the influence of his Spirit, and by his grace and strength, they do works of righteousness externally; and therefore can give nothing to him of their own, nor does he need any, being God all sufficient; even the goodness of his Son does not extend to him, but to the saints, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a>; much less any goodness of theirs: their best works of righteousness are due to him, and not gifts; and though they may contribute to his manifestative glory, both in them that do them and in others that see them, they can add nothing to the essential glory of God; <p>or what receiveth he of thine hand? He can receive nothing but what he has given, or what he has a prior right to and is his due, and so cannot be laid under any obligation to man by what he does; nor can man merit anything at his hand, not even the least temporal mercy, and much less spiritual ones and everlasting life: and what notice God is pleased to take of the good works of men, in away of reward, is not of debt, but of grace, and entirely owing to his goodness; and does not arise from any intrinsic worth in them, or from any advantage to him by them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?</span> By parity of reasoning, as our sins do not injure God, so our righteousness cannot benefit him.

The second interrogative clause, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-2.htm">Job 35:2</a>, is co-ordinate with the first, and the collective thought of this ponderous construction, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-2.htm">Job 35:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-3.htm">Job 35:3</a>, is this: Considerest thou this to be right, and thinkest thou on this account to be able to put thy righteousness above the divine, that, as thou maintainest, no righteousness on the side of God corresponds to this thy righteousness, because God makes no distinction between righteousness and the sin of man, and allows the former to go unrewarded? &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497; (for which Olsh. wishes to read &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a> &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; for &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;) forms with &#1502;&#1488;&#1500; a substantival clause: justitia mea est prae Deo (prae divina); &#1502;&#1503; comparative as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>, comp. on the matter <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-5.htm">Job 34:5</a>, not equivalent to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17</a>. &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is first followed by the oratio obliqua: what it (viz., &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1498;) advantageth thee, then by the or. directa (on this change vid., Ew. 338, a): what profit have I((viz., &#1489;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;), prae peccato meo; this &#1502;&#1503; is also comparative; the constantly ambiguous combination would be allowable from the fact that, according to the usage of the language, "to obtain profit from anything" is expressed by &#1492;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, not by &#1492;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; &#1502;&#1503;.

Elihu's polemic against Job and his companions (&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; are not the three, as lxx and Jer. translate, but the &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, to whom Job is likened by such words as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-8.htm">Job 34:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-36.htm">Job 34:36</a>) is therefore not unauthorized; especially since he assails the conclusion together with its premises.
