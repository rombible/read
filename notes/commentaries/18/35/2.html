Job had not in so many words said this, but what he had said was capable of being so represented, and perhaps seemed to involve it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm" title="This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.">Job 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm" title="If I be wicked, woe to me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see you my affliction;">Job 10:15</a>.) Here, again, there was a misrepresentation of what Job had said. He certainly did not mean that he was none the better for being righteous; on the contrary, he had distinctly said, “Let mine enemy be as the wicked,” &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-7.htm" title="Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that rises up against me as the unrighteous.">Job 27:7</a>, &c.), because <span class= "ital">he </span>could not delight himself in God; but it was perfectly true that he had said that his righteousness had not delivered him from suffering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/35.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/35-2.htm" title="Think you this to be right, that you said, My righteousness is more than God's?...">Job 35:2-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thinkest thou this to be right? — </span>Canst thou in thy conscience, upon second thoughts, approve of what thou hast said? <span class="ital">My righteousness is more than God’s — </span>Not that Job said this in express terms, but he said those things from which this might seem to follow, as that God had punished him more than he deserved. <span class="ital">For thou saidst, </span>&c. — This is produced in proof of the foregoing charge. Job had often affirmed that he was, and still continued to be, righteous, though he had no present benefit by his righteousness, but much bitterness with it; and that God did not act kindly toward him, notwithstanding his former and present piety, but dealt with him as if he had been a most wicked man. Now, Elihu interprets this as implying that he thought himself more righteous than God. <span class="ital">Thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee — </span>Unto me; such changes of persons being frequent in the Hebrew language. <span class="ital">And what profit shall I have, </span>&c. — I have no more present advantage by all my care to please and serve God than wicked men have by their sins against him. God regards my cries no more than theirs, and shows no more kindness or pity to me than he doth to the most profligate wretches. But, it must be remembered, if Job’s words implied any thing of this kind, it was only with reference to his state in the present life. He well knew that he should have much, yea, everlasting advantage from his piety in the life to come.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:1-8 Elihu reproves Job for justifying himself more than God, and called his attention to the heavens. They are far above us, and God is far above them; how much then is he out of the reach, either of our sins or of our services! We have no reason to complain if we have not what we expect, but should be thankful that we have better than we deserve.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thinkest thou this to be right? - This is the point which Elihu now proposes to examine. He, therefore, solemnly appeals to Job himself to determine whether he could himself say that he thought such a sentiment correct.<p>That thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's - Job had nowhere said this in so many words, but Elihu regarded it as the substance of what he had said, or thought that what he had said amounted to the same thing. He had dwelt much on his own sincerity and uprightness of life; he had maintained that he had not been guilty of such crimes as to make these calamities deserved, and he had indulged in severe reflections on the dealings of God with him; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30-35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-13.htm">Job 10:13-15</a>. All this Elihu interprets as equivalent to saying, that he was more righteous than his Maker. It cannot be denied that Job had given occasion for this interpretation to be put on his sentiments, though it cannot be supposed that he would have affirmed this in so many words. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. more than&#8212;rather as in Job 9:2; 25:4: "I am righteous (literally, my righteousness is) before God." The English Version, however, agrees with Job 9:17; 16:12-17; 27:2-6. Job 4:17 is susceptible of either rendering. Elihu means Job said so, not in so many words, but virtually.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Canst thou in thy conscience, upon second thoughts, approve of what thou hast said? Not that Job said this in express terms, but he said those things from which this might seem to follow, as that God punished him more than he deserved or expected, all things considered; and that if he might be admitted to debate his cause with or before God, he did not doubt to carry it, and to obtain that ease and favour from God, which otherwise God would not afford him. But this charge against Job he proves in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thinkest thou this to be right,.... Elihu appeals to Job himself, to his conscience and reason; who as a natural man, guided by the light of nature and reason only, and judging according to the dictates of a natural conscience, and especially as a good man, one that feared God, and had so much knowledge of him and his perfections, as his speeches showed, could never upon reflection think it right what he had said concerning God and his justice, as follows: <p>that thou saidst, my righteousness is more than God's? A strange expression this indeed! but what is to be understood not of his personal righteousness; Job in his senses could never say that this was more or greater than God's, or to be above it and preferred to it in any sense; nor even of righteousness imputed. Old Testament saints had the righteousness of Christ imputed to them, and were justified by it; and so Job, who had knowledge of and faith in Christ as his living Redeemer, and the Lord his righteousness: but then though this is the righteousness of God, wrought out by one that is God as well as man, and approved and accepted of by God, and imputed by him to his people, which is revealed in the Gospel, and is unto all, and upon all them that believe, and they are made the righteousness of God in Christ; yet this cannot be more than the righteousness of God: besides it is not the essential righteousness of Christ as God, as Osiander dreamed, by which men are justified, but his obedience, active and passive, as Mediator, otherwise they would be deified who are justified by it; and if even so absurd a notion as this could obtain, it would not be more of man than the righteousness of God: much less can this be interpreted of Job's inherent righteousness, or the new man which is created in righteousness and true holiness; since all the holiness and righteousness that is in man is from God, and at present imperfect, and therefore cannot be more or greater than his; and still less can this be meant of Job's external righteousness, which, how great soever, was not perfect and without sin; whereas God is just and without iniquity. But there is not a just man that does good and sins not. This therefore must be understood of the righteousness of his cause; and to say that this was more than God's was what he ought not to have said, and more than became him to say: for though a good man may defend himself against the calumnies of his enemies, by asserting his own righteousness, innocence, and integrity, and may desire the Lord to plead his cause against them, and judge him according to his righteousness and the integrity of his heart; but to attempt to make it out, that his cause is more righteous than the Lord's, is doing an ill thing. Now though Job had not expressed this in so many words, yet he had said that from whence this might by consequence be deduced; he had given great occasion for such an inference to be drawn from his speeches; for since he had spoken so largely of his innocence and integrity, and holy life, and of the hard usage nevertheless he had met with from God; and had represented his own case, as if he had behaved so well as to deserve better treatment at the hand of God than to be afflicted in the manner he was; that he had wrong done him, and complained of it, and could not be heard; his judgment was taken from him by the Lord; which was in effect to say, that his cause was better than the Lord's, and would bear a stricter examination than his; which to say was, exceeding bad and unbecoming; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-17.htm">Job 16:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thinkest thou this to be right, <i>that</i> thou saidst, My <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> righteousness <i>is</i> more than God's?</span><p>(a) Job never spoke these words: but because he maintained his innocency, it seemed as though he would say, that God tormented him without just cause.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2–4</span>.

Job is regarded by him as maintaining that he has a right or just cause against God. Elihu here asks if Job considers that the rectitude of his cause will appear in his maintaining that godliness profits a man nothing?—the word <span class="ital">this</span> in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-2.htm" title="Think you this to be right, that you said, My righteousness is more than God's?">Job 35:2</a></span> refers to the questions in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-3.htm" title="For you said, What advantage will it be to you? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?">Job 35:3</a></span>. If Job could successfully maintain this contention his cause against God would be good. Therefore Elihu controverts his assertion, contending that righteousness does avail a man, as it must. Both parties conduct the dispute in a somewhat external way, meaning by the “advantage “of religion the possession of outward goods and immunity from suffering. Job does this of necessity, because he is still entangled in the old theory of retribution, though he is breaking through its meshes on one side. And Elihu in his theoretical argument naturally follows him, without referring to the deeper comforts of religion, the joy in God, with which some of the Psalmists delight themselves in affliction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm" title="As for me, I will behold your face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with your likeness.">Psalm 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-23.htm" title="Nevertheless I am continually with you: you have held me by my right hand.">Psalm 73:23</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>33  Shall He recompense it as thou wilt?
