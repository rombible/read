The right course, therefore, is to wait. “Men may, indeed, complain because of the oppression of an earthly tyrant; but how canst <span class= "ital">thou </span>say thou beholdest Him not?” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm" title="Which makes Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.">Job 9:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/35.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/35-9.htm" title="By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty....">Job 35:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">By reason of the multitude of oppressions — </span>This verse has been supposed by many to contain an argument to prove what he had said <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-8.htm" title="Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are; and your righteousness may profit the son of man.">Job 35:8</a>, that the wickedness of one man may hurt another: but Elihu rather seems to be here beginning a new subject, and, having answered one of Job’s objections, to proceed to another. Job had often complained that he cried to God, and God did not hear his cry. This Elihu may here be considered as answering by a parallel case of men crying out for oppression; whom yet God did not immediately relieve, for just reasons, which he leaves Job to apply to himself. Or he refers to what Job had alleged, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-12.htm" title="Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded cries out: yet God lays not folly to them.">Job 24:12</a>,) respecting men’s <span class="ital">groaning out of the city, </span>&c., which might seem to reflect on God’s providence. This Elihu repeats in this verse, and answers in those following. <span class="ital">But none saith — </span>Few or none of the great numbers of oppressed persons, seriously or sincerely inquire, <span class="ital">Where is God? — </span>They cry out of men, and to men, but they seek not after God, and therefore if God do not hear their cries, he is neither unjust nor unkind; <span class="ital">my Maker </span>— Who alone made me, and who only can deliver me. Who, when our condition is ever so dark and sad, can turn our darkness into light, can quickly put a new song into our mouth, a thanksgiving unto our God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:9-13 Job complained that God did not regard the cries of the oppressed against their oppressors. This he knew not how to reconcile the justice of God and his government. Elihu solves the difficulty. Men do not notice the mercies they enjoy in and under their afflictions, nor are thankful for them, therefore they cannot expect that God should deliver them out of affliction. He gives songs in the night; when our condition is dark and melancholy, there is that in God's providence and promise, which is sufficient to support us, and to enable us even to rejoice in tribulation. When we only pore upon our afflictions, and neglect the consolations of God which are treasured up for us, it is just in God to reject our prayers. Even the things that will kill the body, cannot hurt the soul. If we cry to God for the removal of an affliction, and it is not removed, the reason is, not because the Lord's hand is shortened, or his ear heavy; but because we are not sufficiently humbled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry - It is not quite easy to see the connection which this verse has with what goes before, or its bearing on the argument of Elihu. It seems however, to refer to the "oppressed in general," and to the fact, to which Job had himself adverted <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a>, that people are borne down by oppression and that God does not interpose to save them. They are suffered to remain in that state of oppression - trodden down by people, crushed by the armor of a despot, and overwhelmed with poverty, sorrow, and want, and God does not interpose to rescue them. He looks on and sees all this evil, and does not come forth to deliver those who thus suffer. This is a common case, according to the view of Job; this was his own case, and he could not explain it, and in view of it he had indulged in language which Elihu regarded as a severe reflection on the government of the Almighty. He undertakes, therefore, to "explain the reason" why people are permitted thus to suffer, and why they are not relieved.<p>In the verse before us, he states "the fact," that multitudes "do" thus suffer under the arm of oppression - for that fact could not be denied; in the following verses, he states "the reason" why it is so, and that reason is, that they do not apply in any proper manner to God, who could "give songs in the night," or joy in the midst of calamities, and who could make them acquainted with the nature of his government as intelligent beings, so that they would be able to understand it and acquiesce in it. The phrase "the multitude of oppressions" refers to the numerous and repeated calamities which tyrants bring upon the poor, the down-trodden, and the slave. The phrases "to cry" and "they cry out," refer to the lamentations and sighs of those under the arm of the oppressor. Elihu did not dispute the truth of "the fact" as it was alleged by Job. That fact could not then be doubted any more than it can now, that there were many who were bowed down under burdens imposed by hard-hearted masters, and groaning under the government of tyrants, and that all this was seen and permitted by a holy God. This fact troubled Job - for he was one of this general class of sufferers; and this fact Elihu proposes to account for. Whether his solution is satisfactory, however, may still admit of a doubt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. (Ec 4:1.) Elihu states in Job's words (Job 24. 12; 30. 20) the difficulty; the "cries" of "the oppressed" not being heard might lead man to think that wrongs are not punished by Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The multitude, </span> or <span class="ital">greatness</span>.

But he rather seems to begin a new matter, and having answered one of Job’s objections, to proceed to another, which may be either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This therefore Elihu repeats in this verse, and answereth in the following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To cry; </span> not only to murmur and complain, but to cry out by reason of sore oppression, and to cry to the oppressors or others for pity and help. By reason of the arm of the mighty; because their oppressors are too strong for them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>By reason of the multitude of oppressions, they make the oppressed to cry,.... Which is either an illustration by an instance of what is before said, that wickedness hurts men, as particularly oppression does, which makes then cry; or this refers to something new, to another complaint of Job, or an undue expression of his. Elihu undertakes to answer; that men cry unto God, as he himself had, but are not heard and answered; the place or places referred to may be <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a>. To which Elihu replies, by granting that men oppressed cry because of their oppression, and are not heard; for which reasons may be given, as in the following verses. The poor are often oppressed by the rich, whose wealth gives them power, and that they abuse; and the weak and feeble by the mighty; and their oppressions are many, there is a multitude of them: men in power and authority have various ways of oppressing others, who like the Israelites cry by reason of them, and are made to cry by their oppressors; <p>they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty; which falls with weight, and lies heavy upon them, and crushes them; meaning the power they have, and which they abuse to the injury of them; nor are they able to help themselves or deliver themselves out of their hands, they being mighty, if not in body, yet through wealth; and by means of that authority over them which gives it them: now on account of the pressure upon them, they cry, not to God, but to men: and if they cry to God, it is in a murmuring and complaining way, through impatience under their burden, through envy at the riches and power of others, in a passionate manner, in a revengeful spirit, calling and seeking for vengeance on their oppressors; not in an humble penitent manner, acknowledging their sins, and owning their unworthiness to be heard and regarded, and submitting all to the will of God: for which reasons they are not heard, their cries and, prayers being reckoned no other than howlings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make <i>the oppressed</i> <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</span><p>(e) The wicked may hurt man and cause him to cry, who if he sought God who lends comfort would be delivered.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">they make the Oppressed to cry</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">men cry out because of the multitude of oppressions</span>—which powerful and cruel men lay upon them (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-12.htm" title="There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride of evil men.">Job 35:12</a></span>). This is the anomaly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">9–15</span>. Having laid down his principle Elihu now proceeds to clear away some anomalies which seem to support Job’s contention. There are instances where godliness does not seem to advantage men, where oppressed innocence cries in vain for redress. The reason is that the cry is merely the natural voice of suffering; it is no true devout appeal to heaven—none saith, Where is God my maker?<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - Job had made it a frequent subject of complaint that God did not hear, or at any rate did not answer, his prayers and cries for relief. Elihu answers that Job's case is not exceptional. Those who cry out against oppression and suffering frequently receive no answer, but it is because they "ask amiss." Job should have patience and trust. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by reason</span> <span class="accented">of the multitude of oppressions</span>, <span class="accented">men cry out.</span> It is not Job only who cries to God. Oppressors are numerous; the oppressed are numerous; everywhere there are complaints and outcries. They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. The oppressors are, for the most part, the mighty of the earth - kings, princes, nobles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then began Elihu, and said:<p>  2  Dost thou consider this to be right,<p>Sayest thou: my righteousness exceedeth God's,<p>  3  That thou sayest, what advantage is it to thee,<p>What doth it profit me more than my sin?<p>  4  I will answer thee words,<p>And thy companions with thee.<p>The neutral &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-2.htm">Job 35:2</a>, refers prospectively to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-3.htm">Job 35:3</a>: this that thou sayest. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; with acc. of the obj. and &#1500; of the predicate, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-10.htm">Job 33:10</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-24.htm">Job 13:24</a>, and freq.

We have already on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-9.htm">Job 34:9</a> observed that Job has not directly said (he cites it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-15.htm">Job 21:15</a>, as the saying of the ungodly) what Elihu in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-3.htm">Job 35:3</a> puts into his mouth, but as an inference it certainly is implied in such utterances as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>.
