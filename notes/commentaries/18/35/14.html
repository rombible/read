But to conclude that to-morrow must be as this day, is as absurd as to think that the weather, when either fair or foul, will be always so. When Job looked up to God, he had no reason to speak despairingly. There is a day of judgment, when all that seems amiss will be found to be right, and all that seems dark and difficult will be cleared up and set straight. And if there is Divine wrath in our troubles, it is because we quarrel with God, are fretful, and distrust Divine Providence. This was Job's case. Elihu was directed by God to humble Job, for as to some things he had both opened his mouth in vain, and had multiplied words without knowledge. Let us be admonished, in our afflictions, not so much to set forth the greatness of our suffering, as the greatness of the mercy of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him - This is addressed to Job, and is designed to entreat him to trust in God. Elihu seems to refer to some remark that Job had made, like that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-8.htm">Job 23:8</a>, where he said that he could not come near him, nor bring his cause before him. If he went to the east, the west, thc north, or the south, he could not see him, and could get no opportunity of bringing his cause before him: see the notes at that place. Elihu here says that though it is true in fact that God is invisible, yet this ought not to be regarded as a reason why he should not confide in him. The argument of Elihu here - which is undoubtedly sound - is, that the fact that God is invisible should not be regarded as any evidence that he does not attend to the affairs of people, or that he is not worthy of our love.<p>Judgment is before him - He is a God of justice, and will do that which is right.<p>Therefore trust him - Though he is invisible, and though you cannot bring, your cause directly before him. The word which is used here (&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;  tchu&#770;le&#772;l, from &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;  chu&#770;l) means "to turn around"; to twist; to be firm - as a rope is that is twisted; and then to wait or delay - that is, to be firm in patience. Here it may have this meaning, that Job was to be firm and unmoved, patiently waiting for the time when the now invisible God would interpose in his behalf, though he could not now see him. The idea is, that we may trust the "invisible God," or that we should patiently "wait" for him to manifest himself in our behalf, and may leave all our interests in his hands, with the feeling that they are entirely safe. It must be admitted that Job had not learned this lesson as fully as it might have been learned, and that he had evinced an undue anxiety for some public "manifestation" of the favor and friendship of God, and that he had not shown quite the willingness which he should have done to commit his interests into his hands, though he was unseen. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him&#8212;(as a temporal deliverer; for he did look for a Redeemer after death, Job 19:25-27; which passage cannot consistently with Elihu's assertion here be interpreted of "seeing" a temporal "redeemer"), Job 7:7; 9:11; 23:3, 8, 9; yet, judgment &#8230; ; therefore trust &#8230; But the Hebrew favors Maurer, "How much less (will God &#8230; regard, Job 35:13), since thou sayest, that He does not regard thee." So in Job 4:19. Thus Elihu alludes to Job's words (Job 19:7; 30:20).<p>judgment&#8212;that is, thy cause, thy right; as in Ps 9:16; Pr 31:5, 8.<p>trust&#8212;rather, "wait thou" on Him, patiently, until He take up thy cause (Ps 37:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou shalt not see him; </span> or, <span class="ital">thou canst not see him</span>; the future tense of the indicative mood being oft put potentially; i.e. thou canal not have thy desire in appearing and pleading thy cause before him. So this is a new matter, and Elihu answers another objection of Job’s, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-8.htm" title="Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:">Job 23:8</a>,9</span>, and tells him that he is not to judge of God by present appearance; because though God may for a season hide his face, and delay to give him an answer, yet he will certainly do him right. <span class="ital">Before him</span>, i.e. before God, or in his presence, or at his tribunal, or in all his ways and admininstrations. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">judgment</span> is put for justice or just judgment, as it is <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm" title="Does God pervert judgment? or does the Almighty pervert justice?">Job 8:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-28.htm" title="For the LORD loves judgment, and forsakes not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.">Psalm 37:28</a> 99:4</span>, and oft elsewhere. So the sense is, God is and will show himself to be just in all his ways, and therefore thou dost wickedly in reflecting upon God’s justice. Or, yet <span class="ital">judge</span> thyself <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">before him; </span> instead of accusing God, condemn thyself, acknowledge thy sins, and then thou mayst hope for mercy.

Which is another expression of Job's taken notice of by Elihu, and to which he makes answer; he seems to refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3</a>. God is indeed invisible in his nature and essence, but is to be seen in his works of creation and providence; which Job was acquainted with, and in which he had seen somewhat of the glory of God, and of his divine perfections in them. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4</a>. And he is to be seen in Christ by an eye of faith, and Job had trusted in him as his salvation; and he will be seen with the beatific vision in heaven as he is, in a more glorious and perfect manner, which Job had a full persuasion of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; and therefore is not to be understood in either of those senses, but of his not seeing him on a throne of judgment, hearing and trying his cause, judging and acquitting him; this he had often desired, but despaired of ever seeing it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>; to which Elihu replies; <p>yet judgment is before him; all things are naked and open to him, and stand clear before him; he has perfect knowledge of what is right and wrong; no cause is unknown to him, and needs not to be searched into by him; nor can he nor will he ever pass a wrong judgment: he is just and true, righteous in all his ways and works, the Judge of the whole earth, who will do right, and will plead and judge the cause of every good man sooner or later; if not now, there is a judgment to come with him, when all must appear before his judgment seat, and he will render unto every man according to his works; <p>therefore trust thou in him, or "wait for him" (c); wait for his coming to judgment: wait till that time comes when everything will be brought to light, and every good man shall have praise of God. Or, as we render it, "trust in him"; God alone is the object of trust and confidence, and happy is the man that trusts in him; he is to be trusted in for all things, both temporal, spiritual, and eternal; and particularly for this of doing justice to his people; if not now, yet hereafter, he will render tribulation to them that trouble them; he will right all their wrongs and avenge their injuries, and remove the rebuke that is upon them, and confess them before men and angels, and declare them righteous, and receive them into his kingdom and glory: and be is to be trusted in at all times, in times of adversity as well as prosperity; and even when he is not to be seen, and the dispensations of his providence are dark and intricate, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-10.htm">Isaiah 50:10</a>; The word used signifies such a trust, hope, and waiting, as of a woman in travail, who bears her pains patiently, holding and trusting for a safe deliverance of a child, to the joy of her and her family. <p>(c)  "et expectabis eum", Montanus; "expecta eum", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Mercerus; so Michaelis, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> <i>yet</i> judgment <i>is</i> before him; therefore trust thou in him.</span><p>(g) God is just, however you judge him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14–16</span>.

Though the second person <span class="ital">thou</span> be used, Job’s own case does not appear to be referred to; Elihu speaks generally, and Job is merely addressed as an example of persons who complain of God’s indifference to wrong-doing.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">How much less when thou sayest thou canst not see him!</span> (compare the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> how much less will God attend to thy prayers when thou sayest that thou canst not see or find him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-11.htm">Job 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3, 8-10</a>), that he is altogether hid from thee, and treats thee as an enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-10.htm">Job 33:10</a>)!

The combination &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-15.htm">Psalm 80:15</a> and freq. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, Arab. sh&#803;q, to rub in pieces, make thin, therefore the opposite of &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;) are the thin transparent strata of the atmosphere above the hanging clouds. &#1502;&#1503; after &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; denotes the height that is on the opposite side to the beholder. From the exaltation of God it is then further inferred that it is impossible to exercise any human influence upon Him, by which He might suffer. The pointing wavers here between &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500; (the common fut. form) and &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;(as a contraction of &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500; after the form &#1488;&#1494;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8</a>). Human wrong or right doing neither diminishes nor increases His blessedness; injury or advantage is only on the side of man, from whom it proceeds. Others, whom his conduct affect, are not included in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-8.htm">Job 35:8</a> : righteous or ungodly doing, Elihu means to say, as such and with its consequences, belongs solely to the doer himself, the man "like thee" (&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; with Munach, &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; with Munach), the son of man, i.e., man, capable of evil as of good, and who always, after deciding in favour of the latter or the former, determines his fortune or misfortune, in distinction from God, who ever remains unchangeably the same in His perfect righteousness. What Elihu here says we have already heard from Eliphaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>., and Job even expresses himself similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>; but to Elihu's mind it all becomes for Job new and powerful motives to quiet submission, for what objection should Job raise in justification of his complaints concerning his affliction against such sentiments as these, that goodness bears its reward and evil its punishment in itself, and that God's reward of goodness is not a work of indebtedness, nor His punishment of evil a work of necessity? Before such truth he must really hold his peace. </body></html>
