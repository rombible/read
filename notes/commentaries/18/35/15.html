The Authorised Version refers the first clause to God and the second to Job. Perhaps we may render, <span class= "ital">But now, what His anger has visited upon thee is as nothing </span>(compared with thy deserts); <span class= "ital">yea, He hath not regarded the great abundance </span>(of thy sin), <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, hath not visited it with anger. <span class= "ital">Therefore doth Job, </span>&c.

The word thus rendered <span class= "ital">arrogance </span>is not found elsewhere; it appears to mean abundance or superfluity. Of these renderings, the first seems to give the better sense. The general bearing of the verse is perhaps apparent however rendered, namely, that Job is encouraged in his murmurings, because God hath dealt too leniently with him. Elihu’s reproaches must have been some of the heaviest that Job had to bear. Happily the judgment was not to be long deferred. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm" title="Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 38:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/35.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/35-15.htm" title="But now, because it is not so, he has visited in his anger; yet he knows it not in great extremity:...">Job 35:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">But now, because it is not so — </span>That is, because Job doth not acknowledge God’s justice and his own sins, and wait upon God in a proper way for mercy; <span class="ital">he hath visited in his anger — </span>God hath laid grievous afflictions upon him, all which appear to be too little to bring Job to a compliance with God’s will. <span class="ital">Yet he knoweth it not — </span>Job is not sufficiently sensible of it, so as to be humbled under God’s mighty hand. <span class="ital">In great extremity — </span>Or, though in great extremity, namely, of afflictions.

But to conclude that to-morrow must be as this day, is as absurd as to think that the weather, when either fair or foul, will be always so. When Job looked up to God, he had no reason to speak despairingly. There is a day of judgment, when all that seems amiss will be found to be right, and all that seems dark and difficult will be cleared up and set straight. And if there is Divine wrath in our troubles, it is because we quarrel with God, are fretful, and distrust Divine Providence. This was Job's case. Elihu was directed by God to humble Job, for as to some things he had both opened his mouth in vain, and had multiplied words without knowledge. Let us be admonished, in our afflictions, not so much to set forth the greatness of our suffering, as the greatness of the mercy of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But now, because it is not so - This verse, as it stands in our authorized translation, conveys no intelligible idea. It is evident that the translators meant to give a literal version of the Hebrew, but without understanding its sense. An examination of the principal words and phrases may enable us to ascertain the idea which was in the mind of Elihu when it was uttered. The phrase in the Hebrew here (&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1492; &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;  k&#305;&#770;y-'ayin ve&#8219;atta&#770;h) may mean, "but now it is as nothing," and is to be connected with the following clause, denoting, "now it is comparatively nothing that he has visited you in his anger;" that is, the punishment which he has inflicted on you is almost as nothing compared with what it might have been, or what you have deserved. Job had complained much, and Elihu says to him, that so far from having cause of complaint, his sufferings were as nothing - scarcely worth noticing, compared with what they might have been.<p>He hath visited in his anger - Margin, that is, "God." The word rendered "hath visited" (&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;  pa&#770;qad) means to visit for any purpose - for mercy or justice; to review, take an account of, or investigate conduct. Here it is used with reference to punishment - meaning that the punishment which he had inflicted was trifling compared with the desert of the offences.<p>Yet he knoweth it not - Margin, that is, "Job." The marginal reading here is undoubtedly erroneous. The reference is not to Job, but to God, and the idea is, that he did not "know," that is, did not "take full account" of the sins of Job. He passed them over, and did not bring them all into the account in his dealings with him. Had he done this, and marked every offence with the utmost strictness and severity, his punishment would have been much more severe.<p>In great extremity - The Hebrew here is &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; &#1489;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  bapash me'o&#770;d. The word &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  pash occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew. The Septuagint renders it &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  parapto&#772;ma, "offence." and the Vulgate "scelus," that is, "transgression." The authors of those versions evidently read it as if it were &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;  pesha&#8219;, iniquity; and it may be that the final &#1506;  (&#8219;) has been dropped, like &#1513;&#1493; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;  sha&#770;v', in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>. Gesenius, Theodotion and Symmachus in like manner render it "transgression." Others have regarded it as if from &#1508;&#1493;&#1513; "to be proud," and as meaning "in pride" or "arrogance;" and others, as the rabbis generally, as if from &#1508;&#1493;&#1513;, to "disperse," meaning "on account of the multitude," scil. of transgressions. So Rosenmuller, Umbreit, Luther, and the Chaldee. It seems probable to me that the interpretation of the Septuagint and the Vulgate is the correct one, and that the sense is, that he "does not take cognizance severely (&#1502;&#1488;&#1491;  me'o&#770;d) of transgressions;" that is, that he had not done it in the case of Job. This interpretation agrees with the scope of the passage, and with the view which Elihu meant to express - that God, so far from having given any just cause of complaint, had not even dealt with him as his sins deserved. Without any impeachment of his wisdom or goodness, his inflictions "might" have been far more severe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. As it is, because Job waited not trustingly and patiently (Job 35:14; Nu 20:12; Zep 3:2; Mic 7:9), God hath visited &#8230; ; yet still he has not taken (severe) cognizance of the great multitude (English Version wrongly, "extremity") of sins; therefore Job should not complain of being punished with undue severity (Job 7:20; 11:6). Maurer translates: "Because His anger hath not visited (hath not immediately punished Job for his impious complaints), nor has He taken strict (great) cognizance of his folly (sinful speeches); therefore," &c. For "folly," Umbreit translates with the Rabbins, "multitude." Gesenius reads with the Septuagint and Vulgate needlessly, "transgression."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Because it is not so, </span> i.e. because Job doth not acknowledge God’s justice and his own sins, and wait upon God in his way for mercy, according to the last advice given to him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-14.htm" title="Although you say you shall not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust you in him.">Job 35:14</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He, </span> to wit, God, to whom this great work of visiting is ascribed every where in Scripture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hath visited in his anger, </span> i.e. hath laid grievous afflictions upon him; all which is too little to bring Job to compliance with God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He knoweth it not; </span> Job is not sufficiently sensible of it, so as to be humbled under God’s hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In great extremity; </span> or, though (which particle is sometimes understood, of which examples have been before) <span class="ital">in great extremity</span>, or abundance, to wit, of afflictions.

Because there was not such trust, hope, patience, and quiet expectation in Job that God would appear for him, and do him, justice openly and publicly; for though he had hope and confidence of an interest in his living Redeemer and Saviour, and of eternal life and happiness through him; yet not of his bringing his judgment to the light, and of his beholding his righteousness, as he ought to have had, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <p>he hath visited in his anger; corrected and chastised in fatherly anger and displeasure, though not in wrath and vengeance, and in a way of punishment in strict justice; but consistent with his invariable love and free favour in Christ; being displeased at his want of faith and patience, failing in the exercise of which is oftentimes resented by the Lord, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>; <p>yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: so stupid was Job, that though he was in the utmost extremity of affliction, in his body, family, and substance, yet was not sensible it was his duty to trust in God, and patiently wait for him; he knew that the hand of God was upon him, and that he had visited him in anger, and that his arrows stuck fast in him, and his hand pressed him sore; but was insensible of the cause of the continuance of it, his unbelief, impatience, and non-submission to the will of God. The word for "extremity" signifies "abundance" (d), and may be applied to an abundance and plenty of good things; and therefore some understand it of Job's prosperity, and take the sense to be, that God took no notice of this; it did not hinder him from visiting him, but he destroyed it all: though Mr. Broughton, on the other hand, interprets it of the great plenty of sorrows and distresses Job was attended with, the true cause of which he did not advert to: some (e) think the whole refers to the merciful dealings of God with Job, and read the first clause, <p>"know now his anger hath visited but a little or noticing;'' <p>the affliction is but a light one comparatively speaking, scarce any thing at all in comparison of what sin deserves, being abundantly less than that: <p>"neither hath he made great inquisition, or inquired out the multitude'' <p>of sins; not strictly and severely marking them, and dealing with and for them according to their deserts; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>; with which compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>; and therefore Job had no reason to complain of God, or of any hard usage from him. <p>(d) "in copia", Montanus; "ad auctum valde", Cocceius; "prosperitatem", De Dieu; so Patrick.

Elihu weakens the doubt expressed by Job in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a>, that God allows injustice to prevail, and oppressed innocence remains without vindication. The failure of the latter arises from the fact of the sufferers complaining, but not seeking earnestly the only true helper, God their maker (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, intensive plur., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-2.htm">Psalm 149:2</a>), who gives (to which may be compared a passage of the Edda: "Wuodan gives songs to the Scalds") songs (&#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, from the onomatopoetic &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;) in the night, i.e., who in the night of sorrow puts songs of praise concerning the dawning light of help into the mouth of the sufferers. The singing of the glory of the nightly heavens (Stick., Hahn) is to be as little thought of as the music of the spheres; the night is, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-25.htm">Job 34:25</a>, the time of unexpectedly sudden change.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-11.htm">Job 35:11</a> most expositors (last of all Schlottm.) take the two &#1502;&#1503; as comparative. Elihu would then, since he feels the absence of the asking after this God on the part of the sufferers, mean the conscious relation in which He has placed us to Himself, and in accordance with which the sufferer should not merely instinctively complain, but humbly bow himself and earnestly offer up prayer. But according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-7.htm">Job 12:7</a> (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6</a>, &#1493;&#1495;&#1499;&#1501;), it is to be translated: who teaches (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-40.htm">2 Samuel 22:40</a>, Psalter i. 160) us from the beasts of the earth (so that from them as a means of instruction teaching comes to us), and makes us wise from the birds of heaven. The fut. interchanging with the part. better accords with this translation, according to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-11.htm">Job 35:11</a> is a continuation of the assertion of a divine instruction, by means of the animal creation; the thought also suits the connection better, for of the many things that may be learned from the animal creation, prayer here comes under consideration, - the lions roar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a>; the thirsty cattle cry to God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; the ravens call upon God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>. It we now determine the collective thought of <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>, that affliction does not drive most men to God the almighty Helper, who will be humbly entreated for help: it is more natural to take &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-7.htm">Job 23:7</a>) in the sense of then (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;), than, with reference to the scene of oppression, in the sense of there (lxx, Jer.: ibi). The division of the verse is correct, and H. B. Starcke has correctly interpreted: Tunc clamabunt (sed non respondebit) propter superbiam (insolentiam) malorum. &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is not to be connected with &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; in the sense of non exaudiet et servabit, by which constr. praegnans one would expect &#1502;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>, instead of &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, nor in the sense of non exaudiet propter (Hirz., Schlottm.), for the arrogant &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; are not those who complain unheard: but, as the connection shows, those from whom the occasion of complaint proceeds. Therefore: not allowing themselves to be driven to God by oppression, they cry then, without, however, being heard of God, by reason of the arrogance of evil men which they have to endure. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-13.htm">Job 35:13</a> gives the reason of their obtaining no answer: Only emptiness (i.e., mere motion of the lips without the true spirit of prayer) God heareth not, and the Almighty observeth it not. Hahn wrongly denies &#1488;&#1498; the significations certo and verumtamen; but we prefer the restrictive signification (sheer emptiness or hollowness) which proceeds from the affirmative primary signification<p>(Note: Vid., Hupfeld in the Zeitschr. fr Kunde des Morgenl. ii.441f.)<p>continued...</body></html>
