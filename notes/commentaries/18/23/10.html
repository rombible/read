It is a great comfort to those who are upright in their intentions, and mean honestly, that God understands their meaning though men do not, cannot, or will not. <span class="ital">When he hath tried me — </span>When he hath proved me by these afflictions, as gold is tried by the fire; <span class="ital">I shall come forth as gold — </span>Which comes forth from the furnace pure from all dross.

His views were all gloomy. God seemed to stand at a distance, and frown upon him. Yet Job expressed his assurance that he should be brought forth, tried, and approved, for he had obeyed the precepts of God. He had relished and delighted in the truths and commandments of God. Here we should notice that Job justified himself rather than God, or in opposition to him, ch. 32:2. Job might feel that he was clear from the charges of his friends, but boldly to assert that, though visited by the hand of God, it was not a chastisement of sin, was his error. And he is guilty of a second, when he denies that there are dealings of Providence with men in this present life, wherein the injured find redress, and the evil are visited for their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he knoweth the way that I take - Margin, "is with me." That is, "I have the utmost confidence in him. Though I cannot see him, yet he sees me, and he knows my integrity; and whatever people may say, or however they may misunderstand my character, yet he is acquainted with me, and I have the fullest confidence that he will do me justice."<p>When he hath tried me - When he has subjected me to all the tests of character which he shall choose to apply.<p>I shall come forth as gold - As gold that is tried in the crucible, and that comes forth the more pure the intenser is the heat. The application of fire to it serves to separate every particle of impurity or alloy, and leaves only the pure metal. So it is with trials applied to the friend of God; and we may remark<p>(1) That all real piety will bear "any" test that may be applied to it, as gold will bear any degree of heat without being injured or destroyed.<p>(2) That the effect of all trials is to purify piety, and make it more bright and valuable, as is the effect of applying intense heat to gold.<p>(3) There is often much alloy in the piety of a Christian, as there is in gold, that needs to be removed by the fiery trial of affliction. Nothing else will remove it but trial, as nothing will be so effectual a purifier of gold as intense heat.<p>(4) A true Christian should not dread trial. It will not hurt him. He will be the more valuable for his trials, as gold is for the application of heat. There is no danger of destroying true piety. It will live in the flames, and will survive the raging heat that shall yet consume the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

This he seems to say in a way of solace to himself, comforting and contenting himself, that though he could not find God, nor knew where he was, or what way he took, nor the reasons of his ways and dispensations with the children of men, and with himself, yet God knew where he was, and what way he took; by which he means either the way he took, being directed to it for his acceptance with God, his justification before him, and eternal salvation; which was his living Redeemer, he looked unto by faith for righteousness and eternal life: or rather the way and manner of life he took to, the course of his conversation, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, in the paths of piety and truth, of righteousness and holiness; and this God knew not barely by his omniscience, as he knows all the ways of men, good and bad; his eyes are upon them, lie compasses them, and is thoroughly acquainted with them; but by way of approbation, he approved of it, and was well pleased with it, it being so agreeable to his revealed will, so pure and holy; thus the Lord knows the way of the righteous, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>; <p>when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold; as pure as gold, as free from dross as that, appear quite innocent of the charges brought against him, and shine in his integrity. He was as valuable and precious as gold, as all God's people are in his esteem, however reckoned of by others; they are precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold; not that they have any intrinsic, worth in themselves, they are in no wise the better than others by nature; but through the grace of God bestowed on them, which is as gold tried in the fire; and through the righteousness of Christ imputed to them, which is gold of Ophir, and clothing of wrought gold; and, on account of both, they are like a mass of gold, and are the chosen of God, and precious: this gold he tries, the Lord trieth the righteous; and which he does by afflictive providences; he puts them into the furnace of affliction, which is the fiery trial to try them; and hereby their graces are tried, their faith, hope, love, patience, &amp;c. their principles and doctrines they embrace, whether they are gold, silver, and precious stones, or whether wood, hay, and stubble; the fire tries every man's work, of what sort it is, and whether they will abide by them and their profession also, whether they will adhere to it; and by this means he purges away their dross and tin, and they come out of the furnace as pure gold in great lustre and brightness, as those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-13.htm">Revelation 7:13</a>; now Job was in this furnace and trying; and he was confident that, as he should come out of it, he should appear to great advantage, pure and spotless; though it may be he may have respect to his trial at the bar of justice, where he desired to be tried, and be brought under the strictest examination; and doubted not but he should be acquitted, and shine as bright as gold; nay, these words may be given as a reason why God would not be found by him as his Judge to try his cause, because he knew his uprightness and integrity, and that he must go from him acquitted and discharged; and therefore, for reasons unknown to him, declined the judging of him; to this purpose Jarchi interprets the words, which may be rendered, "for he knoweth the way that I take" (a); and therefore will not be seen by me, nor appear to judge me: "he hath tried me"; again and again, and has seen the integrity of my heart, as Sephorno interprets it, and well knows my innocence; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>; and if he would try me again, "I shall come forth as gold"; quite clear of all charges and imputations; I am able to stand the strictest scrutiny: this he said as conscious of his uprightness, and of his strict regard to the ways and word of God, as follows; but this was a bold saying, and an unbecoming expression of his to God; and of which he afterwards was ashamed and repented, when God appeared and spoke to him out of the whirlwind. <p>(a) "quia", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, Piscator, Michaelis; "nam", Tigurine version, Cocceius, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But he knoweth the <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> way that I take: <i>when</i> he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</span><p>(f) God has this preeminence about me, that he knows my way: that is, that I am not able to judge his work, he shows also his confidence, that God uses him for his profit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

Schlottm.). These interpretations are objectionable on account of the artificial restoration of the connection between the two members of the verse, which they require; they lead one to expect &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; (as a circumstantial clause: lxx, Cod. Vat. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;). As the words stand, it is to be supposed that the definition of time, &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; (even to-day still, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>), belongs to both divisions of the verse. How, then, is &#1502;&#1512;&#1497; to be understood? If we compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>, where &#1502;&#1512;, which is combined with &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;, signifies amarum  equals  amartiduo, it is natural to take &#1502;&#1512;&#1497; also in the signification amaritudo, acerbitas (Targ., Syr., Jer.); and this is also possible, since, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, the verbal forms &#1502;&#1512;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1492; run into one another, as they are really cognates.<p>(Note: &#1502;&#1512;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1492; both spring from the root &#1502;&#1512; [vid. supra, p. 396, note], with the primary signification stringere, to beat, rub, draw tight. Hence Arab. ma&#770;rra&#770;, to touch lightly, smear upon (to go by, over, or through, to move by, etc.), but also stringere palatum, of an astringent taste, strong in taste, to be bitter, opp. Arab. h&#803;ala&#770;, soft and mild in taste, to be sweet, as in another direction &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, to be loose, weak, sick, both from the root Arab. h&#803;l in h&#803;alla, solvit, laxavit. From the signification to be tight come amarra, to stretch tight, istamarra, to stretch one's self tight, to draw one's self out in this state of tension - of things in time, to continue unbroken; mirreh, string, cord; &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, to make and hold one's self tight against any one, i.e., to be obstinate: originally of the body, as Arab. ma&#770;rra&#770;, tama&#770;rra&#770;, to strengthen themselves in the contest against one another; then of the mind, as Arab. ma&#770;ra&#770;, tama&#770;ra&#770;, to struggle against anything, both outwardly by contradiction and disputing, and inwardly by doubt and unbelief. - Fl.)<p>But it is more satisfactory, and more in accordance with the relation of the two divisions of the verse, if we keep to the usual signification of &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;; not, however, understanding it of obstinacy, revolt, rebellion (viz., in the sense of the friends), but, like moreh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-26.htm">2 Kings 14:26</a>) which describes the affliction as stiff-necked, obstinate), of stubbornness, defiance, continuance in opposition, and explain with Raschi: My complaint is still always defiance, i.e., still maintains itself in opposition, viz., against God, without yielding (Hahn, Olsh.: unsubmitting); or rather: against such exhortations to penitence as those which Eliphaz has just addressed to him. In reply to these, Job considers his complain to be well justified even to-day, i.e., even now (for it is not, with Ewald, to be imagined that, in the mind of the poet, the controversy extends over several days, - an idea which would only be indicated by this one word).<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a> he continues the same thought under a different form of expression. My hand lies heavy on my groaning, i.e., I hold it immoveably fast (as Fleischer proposes to take the words); or better: I am driven to a continued utterance of it.<p>(Note: The idea might also be: My hand presses my groaning back (because it would be of no use to me); but <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a> is against this, and the Arab. kamada, to restrain inward pain, anger, etc. by force (e.g., ma&#770;t kemed, he died from suppressed rage or anxiety), has scarcely any etymological connection with &#1499;&#1489;&#1491;.)<p>continued...</body></html>
