These, Job says, <span class="ital">his foot had held, </span>that is, he had made a free and fixed choice of them; had taken fast hold of them; had been strongly and firmly resolved and settled to walk in them. <span class="ital">Neither have I gone back — </span>Turned aside to any crooked or sinful path, or course of life. <span class="ital">I have esteemed the word of his mouth — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">צפנתי</span>, <span class="ital">tzaphanti; abscondi, reposui, I have hid, </span>or <span class="ital">laid it up, </span>as men do their best treasures, or what they most love and value. The expression signifies a high esteem for it, a hearty affection to it, and a diligent care to preserve it. <span class="ital">More than my necessary food — </span>Or, <span class="ital">my appointed, </span>or <span class="ital">daily portion; </span>that food or provision which is necessary for the support of my life, (as the same word is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-22.htm" title="Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: why they sold not their lands.">Genesis 47:22</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-8.htm" title="Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:">Proverbs 30:8</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-15.htm" title="She rises also while it is yet night, and gives meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.">Proverbs 31:15</a>,) and which is more prized and desired than all the riches of the world. There is, however, nothing in the Hebrew for the word <span class="ital">food, </span>which our translators have supplied, the term <span class="greekheb">חקי</span>, <span class="ital">chokki, </span>meaning simply <span class="ital">statutum, </span>vel, <span class="ital">præscriptum mihi, </span>what is appointed or prescribed to me. Chappelow, therefore, renders the whole verse thus: “As to the commandment of his lips, I have made no digression: according to what is prescribed me, I have kept the words of his mouth.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:8-12 Job knew that the Lord was every where present; but his mind was in such confusion, that he could get no fixed view of God's merciful presence, so as to find comfort by spreading his case before him. His views were all gloomy. God seemed to stand at a distance, and frown upon him. Yet Job expressed his assurance that he should be brought forth, tried, and approved, for he had obeyed the precepts of God. He had relished and delighted in the truths and commandments of God. Here we should notice that Job justified himself rather than God, or in opposition to him, ch. 32:2. Job might feel that he was clear from the charges of his friends, but boldly to assert that, though visited by the hand of God, it was not a chastisement of sin, was his error. And he is guilty of a second, when he denies that there are dealings of Providence with men in this present life, wherein the injured find redress, and the evil are visited for their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My foot hath held his steps - Roberts, in his Oriental Illustrations, and the Editor of the Pictorial Bible, suppose that there is an allusion here to the active, grasping power which the Orientals have in their feet and toes. By constant usage they accustom themselves to make use of them in holding things in a manner which to us seems almost incredible, and they make the toes perform almost the work of fingers. We bind ours fast from early childhood in our close shoes, and they become useless except for the purpose of walking. But the Orientals use theirs differently. They seize upon an object with their toes, and hold it fast. If in walking along they see anything on the ground which they desire to pick up, instead of stooping as we would, they seize it with their toes, and lift it up. Alypulle, a Kandian chief, was about to be beheaded. When he arrived at the place of execution, he looked round for some object on which to seize, and saw a small shrub, and seized it with his toes, and held it fast in order to be firm while the executioner did his office. "Roberts." So an Arab in treading firmly, or in taking a determined stand, seems to lay hold of, to grasp the ground with his toes, giving a fixedness of position inconceivable to those whose feet are cramped by the use of tight shoes. This may be the meaning here, that Job had fixed himself firmly in the footsteps of God, and had adhered tenaciously to him; or, as it is rendered by Dr. Good," In his steps will I rivet my feet."<p>And not declined - Turned aside. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. held&#8212;fast by His steps.

Schlottm.). These interpretations are objectionable on account of the artificial restoration of the connection between the two members of the verse, which they require; they lead one to expect &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; (as a circumstantial clause: lxx, Cod. Vat. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;). As the words stand, it is to be supposed that the definition of time, &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; (even to-day still, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>), belongs to both divisions of the verse. How, then, is &#1502;&#1512;&#1497; to be understood? If we compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>, where &#1502;&#1512;, which is combined with &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;, signifies amarum  equals  amartiduo, it is natural to take &#1502;&#1512;&#1497; also in the signification amaritudo, acerbitas (Targ., Syr., Jer.); and this is also possible, since, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, the verbal forms &#1502;&#1512;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1492; run into one another, as they are really cognates.<p>(Note: &#1502;&#1512;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1492; both spring from the root &#1502;&#1512; [vid. supra, p. 396, note], with the primary signification stringere, to beat, rub, draw tight. Hence Arab. ma&#770;rra&#770;, to touch lightly, smear upon (to go by, over, or through, to move by, etc.), but also stringere palatum, of an astringent taste, strong in taste, to be bitter, opp. Arab. h&#803;ala&#770;, soft and mild in taste, to be sweet, as in another direction &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, to be loose, weak, sick, both from the root Arab. h&#803;l in h&#803;alla, solvit, laxavit. From the signification to be tight come amarra, to stretch tight, istamarra, to stretch one's self tight, to draw one's self out in this state of tension - of things in time, to continue unbroken; mirreh, string, cord; &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, to make and hold one's self tight against any one, i.e., to be obstinate: originally of the body, as Arab. ma&#770;rra&#770;, tama&#770;rra&#770;, to strengthen themselves in the contest against one another; then of the mind, as Arab. ma&#770;ra&#770;, tama&#770;ra&#770;, to struggle against anything, both outwardly by contradiction and disputing, and inwardly by doubt and unbelief. - Fl.)<p>But it is more satisfactory, and more in accordance with the relation of the two divisions of the verse, if we keep to the usual signification of &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;; not, however, understanding it of obstinacy, revolt, rebellion (viz., in the sense of the friends), but, like moreh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-26.htm">2 Kings 14:26</a>) which describes the affliction as stiff-necked, obstinate), of stubbornness, defiance, continuance in opposition, and explain with Raschi: My complaint is still always defiance, i.e., still maintains itself in opposition, viz., against God, without yielding (Hahn, Olsh.: unsubmitting); or rather: against such exhortations to penitence as those which Eliphaz has just addressed to him. In reply to these, Job considers his complain to be well justified even to-day, i.e., even now (for it is not, with Ewald, to be imagined that, in the mind of the poet, the controversy extends over several days, - an idea which would only be indicated by this one word).<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a> he continues the same thought under a different form of expression. My hand lies heavy on my groaning, i.e., I hold it immoveably fast (as Fleischer proposes to take the words); or better: I am driven to a continued utterance of it.<p>(Note: The idea might also be: My hand presses my groaning back (because it would be of no use to me); but <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a> is against this, and the Arab. kamada, to restrain inward pain, anger, etc. by force (e.g., ma&#770;t kemed, he died from suppressed rage or anxiety), has scarcely any etymological connection with &#1499;&#1489;&#1491;.)<p>continued...</body></html>
