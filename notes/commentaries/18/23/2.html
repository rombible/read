He wants to have his cause tried quickly. Blessed be God, we may know where to find him. He is in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself; and upon a mercy-seat, waiting to be gracious. Thither the sinner may go; and there the believer may order his cause before Him, with arguments taken from his promises, his covenant, and his glory. A patient waiting for death and judgment is our wisdom and duty, and it cannot be without a holy fear and trembling.

The meaning is, not that he made bitter complaints in the sense which those words would naturally convey, or that he meant to find fault with God, but that his case was a hard one. His friends furnished him no relief, and he had in vain endeavored to bring his cause before God. This is now, as he proceeds to state, the principal cause of his difficulty. He knows not where to find God; he cannot get his cause before him.<p>My stroke - Margin, as in Hebrew "hand;" that is, the hand that is upon me, or the calamity that is inflicted upon me.

They are no adequate expression of my woes. If you think I complain; if I am heard to groan, yet the sufferings which I endure are far beyond what these would secm to indicate.

Job's afflictions were continued on him long; he was made to possess months of vanity; and, as he had been complaining ever since they were upon him, he still continued to complain to that day, "even" after all the comforts his friends pretended to administer to him, as Jarchi observes: his complaints were concerning his afflictions, and his friends' ill usage of him under them; not of injustice in God in afflicting him, though he thought he dealt severely with him; but of the greatness of his afflictions, they being intolerable, and his strength unequal to them, and therefore death was more eligible to him than life; and he complained of God's hiding his face from him, and not hearing him, nor showing him wherefore he contended with him, nor admitting an hearing of his cause before him: and this complaint of his was "bitter": the things he complained of were such, bitter afflictions, like the waters of Marah the Israelites could not drink of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23</a>; there was a great deal of wormwood and gall in his affliction and misery; and it was in a bitter way, in the bitterness of his soul, he made his complaint; and, what made his case still worse, he could not utter any complaint, so much as a sigh or a groan, but it was reckoned "provocation", or "stubbornness and rebellion", by his friends; so some render the word (x), as Mr. Broughton does, "this day my sighing is holden a rebellion": there is indeed a great deal of rebellion oftentimes in the hearts, words and actions, conduct and behaviour, even of good men under afflictions, as were in the Israelites in the wilderness; and a difficult thing it is to complain without being guilty of it; though complaints may be without it, yet repinings and murmurings are always attended with it: <p>and my stroke is heavier than my groaning; or "my hand" (y), meaning either his own hand, which was heavy, and hung down, his spirits failing, his strength being exhausted, and so his hands weak, feeble, and remiss, that he could not hold them up through his afflictions, and his groanings under them, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-5.htm">Psalm 102:5</a>; or the hand of God upon him, his afflicting hand, which had touched him and pressed hard upon him, and lay heavy, and was heavier than his groanings showed; though he groaned much, he did not groan more, nor so much, as his afflictions called for; and therefore it was no wonder that his complaint was bitter, nor should it be reckoned rebellion and provocation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-2.htm">Job 6:2</a>. <p>(x) "exacerbatio", Montanus, Vatablus, Schmidt; "exasperatio", Mercerus, Drusius; "pertinacia", Bolducius; "contumacia habetur", Cocceius; "rebellionem haberi", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "rebellio est", Piscator, Codurcus.

The A. V. is almost certainly wrong in its rendering of this verse, though a more satisfactory rendering is hard to give. The text is probably faulty. Literally tendered according to the usual meaning of the words the verse reads, <span class="ital">even to-day is my complaint rebellion, my hand is heavy upon my groaning</span>. The A. V. has assumed, after the Vulgate, that the word usually meaning “rebellion” (<span class="ital">mri</span>) is a form of the word “bitter” (<span class="ital">mar</span>), or that the latter word should be read. It has also assumed that “my hand” may mean <span class="ital">the hand</span> (of God) <span class="ital">upon me</span>, i. e. “my stroke.” But this is scarcely possible; “my arrow,” ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-6.htm" title="Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.">Job 34:6</a>, being no true parallel. Further, it has assumed that the well-known phrase “to be heavy upon,” e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-4.htm" title="For day and night your hand was heavy on me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.">Psalm 32:4</a>, may mean “to be heavy above,” i. e. <span class="ital">heavier than</span> my groaning. This also is scarcely to be believed. On the other hand it is difficult to extract sense from the literal rendering given above. The expression “my complaint is rebellion” may be used from the point of view of the three friends: <span class="ital">even to-day</span> (still) <span class="ital">is my complaint</span> accounted <span class="ital">rebellion</span>, though <span class="ital">my hand lies heavy upon my groaning</span>, i. e. represses it; the meaning being, that Job was accounted rebellious by his friends, while in fact his complaint and groaning in no way came up to the terrible weight of his calamities—the same idea as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-2.htm" title="Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!">Job 6:2</a>. Then the following verses proceed to describe the cause he has for complaint. Or the words “my complaint is rebellion” may express Job’s own feeling: “I refuse to submit to my afflictions, or acknowledge that they are just.” In this case the next words: “my hand lies heavy on my groaning” must mean “my hand presses out my groaning in a continual stream.” But this is an extraordinary sense to put on the phrase “to lie heavy upon.” Others, assuming that the text is corrupt, make alterations more or less serious in words, as “<span class="ital">His</span> hand” for “<span class="ital">my</span> hand” in the second clause.
