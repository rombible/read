Here in words of great sublimity Job depicts the unapproachable majesty of God omnipotent, but invisible, and shows the utter hopelessness of entering into judgment with Him. Unfortunately, though this is a proposition to which all must assent, yet none is virtually so much repudiated or practically so often contravened. Men still cast about to justify themselves before God, and will do so till the end of time; but it is in teaching such as this that the Book of Job has laid the foundation of the Gospel by preparing for its acceptance by overthrowing man’s natural and habitual standing-ground in himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-11.htm" title="See, he goes by me, and I see him not: he passes on also, but I perceive him not.">Job 9:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Lo he goeth by me — </span>Or <span class="ital">besides, </span>or <span class="ital">before </span>me, in my presence; that is, he worketh by his providence in ways of mercy or judgment. <span class="ital">And I see him not — </span>I see the effects, but I cannot understand the causes or grounds of his actions, for they are incomprehensible to me, or any other man: for though Job speaks only in his own person, yet he means to affirm it of all men, that such is the weakness of their understandings that they cannot search out God’s counsels and ways. The operations of second causes are commonly obvious to our senses; but, though God works by those causes, we see him not, nor can our finite minds fathom his counsels, apprehend his motions, or comprehend the measures he takes. <span class="ital">He passeth on also — </span>He goeth from place to place; from one action to another. <span class="ital">But I perceive him not — </span>He passes and acts invisibly and undiscerned.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-13 In this answer Job declared that he did not doubt the justice of God, when he denied himself to be a hypocrite; for how should man be just with God? Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lo, he goeth by me - That is, he passes along - as in the silent movements of the heavenly bodies. "I see the evidence of his existence. I can see that God must be there - moving along by me in the orbs of night and in the march of the constellations, but I cannot see God himself. He passes by, or rather he passes over me (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;  &#8219;a&#772;lay), as in the majestic movement of the heavenly bodies over my head." This is, I think, the idea, and the image is exceedingly poetic and beautiful. The heavens are seen to move in silent grandeur. The northern constellation rolls around the pole. The others move on as a marshalled army. They go in silent and solemn order, and God must be there. But, says Job, I cannot see him. I can feel that he must be there, and I look out on the heavens to see him, but my eyes fail, and I cannot behold him. He passes on, and I see him not. Who has ever looked upon the heavens in the still night, and seen the silent grandeur of such movements of the heavenly host, without some such feeling - some emotion of inexpressible awe - as if he, if I may so express it, COULD ALMOST SEE GOD? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. I see him not: he passeth on&#8212;The image is that of a howling wind (Isa 21:1). Like it when it bursts invisibly upon man, so God is felt in the awful effects of His wrath, but is not seen (Joh 3:8). Therefore, reasons Job, it is impossible to contend with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He goeth, </span> i.e. he worketh by his providence in ways of mercy or judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By me; </span> or, <span class="ital">besides</span> or <span class="ital">before me</span>; in my presence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I see him not; </span> I see the effects, but I cannot understand the causes or grounds of his actions, for they are incomprehensible by me, or by any other men: for though he speaks only in his own person, yet he means it of all men; that such is the weakness of men’s understandings, that they cannot search out God’s counsels and ways: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-27.htm" title="That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:">Acts 17:27</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He passeth on also; </span> he goeth from place to place, from one action to another.

This is expressive of the invisibility of God; for though the angels in heaven always behold his face, and men, in the works of creation, may see his eternal power and Godhead, and other perfections of it displayed therein; and saints by faith have a comfortable and delightful view of him, of his countenance, his love, grace and mercy in his word and ordinances, and especially in the face and person of Christ, the image of the invisible God, and will in heaven most clearly see him as he is, in the greater display of his glory and his grace; yet his essence is invisible, not only not to be seen with corporeal eyes, but not to be comprehended in the mind: <p>he passeth on also, but I perceive him not; this "going and passing on", as, ascribed to God, must be understood in consistence with his omnipresence; he cannot be thought to move from place to place who is everywhere, who fills heaven and earth with his presence, and there is no going from it: local motion cannot be said of him; but this respects the operations of his providence; he is continually working all around us, by supporting us in being, and supplying us with what we want, and so is near us, and yet we see him not: Job experienced the bounties of his providence, as well as the blessings of his grace, in the time of his prosperity, and now he felt the weight of his afflicting hand upon him; but yet, as to his essence, he could not see him; he was sensible that he was nigh him, and find a concern in all that befell him, but he could neither see nor comprehend him, nor account for his dealings with him: he had "passed by" him in his state of nature, and had looked graciously on him, and had said unto him, Live; he had "passed on" from him, and hid his face so that he could not see him, nor find him backward nor forward, on the right hand, nor on the left, where he used to work, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Lo, he goeth <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> by me, and I see <i>him</i> not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</span><p>(e) I am not able to comprehend his works, which are common and daily before my eyes, much less in those things, which are hid and secret.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. This power is subtle and invisible in its presence, felt but impossible to grasp.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">11–24</span>. From the operation of this terrible force in the physical world Job passes on to describe its display among creatures, and to shew how it paralyses and crushes them.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not</span>. Near as God is to us, close as he comes to us, we cannot directly see him, or feel him, or perceive his presence. We know it by faith, we may feel it in our inmost spirits; but there is no manifestation of it to our senses. A sharp line divides the visible and invisible worlds; and this line, if it is ever crossed, is very rarely crossed. Job possibly reflects upon the pretension of Eliphaz to have had a physical consciousness of the visitation of a spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15, 16</a>), and asserts, with a tinge of sarcasm, that it is otherwise with him - the spirit-worm passes him by, and he receives no light, no illumination, no miraculous direction from it. <span class="cmt_word">He passeth on also</span>. The same verb is used by Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15</a>) in speaking of his spiritual visitation. <span class="cmt_word">But I perceive him not</span>. Eliphaz perceived the presence of the spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15, 16</a>) and heard its voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16-21</a>). Job seems to mean that he is not so favoured. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  5  Who removeth mountains without their knowing,<p>That He hath overturned them in His wrath;<p>  6  Who causeth the earth to shake out of its place,<p>And its pillars to tremble;<p>  7  Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not,<p>And sealeth up the stars.<p>&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-5.htm">Job 9:5</a>) may also be translated: without one's perceiving it or knowing why; but it is more natural to take the mountains as the subject. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, quod, that (not "as," Ewald, 333, a), after &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>. Even the lofty mountains are quite unconscious of the change which He effects on them in a moment. Before they are aware that it is being done, it is over, as the praet. implies; the destructive power of His anger is irresistible, and effects its purpose suddenly. He causes the earth to start up from its place (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>) which it occupies in space (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>); and by being thus set in motion by Him, its pillars tremble, i.e., its internal foundations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-5.htm">Psalm 104:5</a>), which are removed from human perception (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-6.htm">Job 38:6</a>). It is not the highest mountains, which are rather called the pillars, as it were the supports, of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11</a>), that are meant. By the same almighty will He disposes of the sun and stars. The sun is here called &#1495;&#1512;&#1505; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-18.htm">Judges 14:18</a> &#1495;&#1512;&#1505;&#1492; with unaccented ah, and as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a> &#8219;Ir ha-Heres is a play upon &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1505; &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, &#x397;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), perhaps from the same root as &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, one of the poetical names of gold. At His command the sun rises not, and He seals up the stars, i.e., conceals them behind thick clouds, so that the day becomes dark, and the night is not made bright. One may with Schultens think of the Flood, or with Warburton of the Egyptian darkness, and the standing still of the sun at the word of Joshua; but these are only single historical instances of a fact here affirmed as a universal experience of the divine power. </body></html>
