Bildad says, if he were pure and upright, God would interpose in his behalf. Job replies, that all this is very true; but the difficulty is, to be thus pure and upright: ‘for I am not exempt from the common failings of men: if, therefore, they are sufficient to account for the great calamities which have befallen me, I am still without a remedy. As to God’s power and wisdom, I am as thoroughly convinced, and can give as many instances of it as you; and, therefore, I know it is in vain for me to contend with him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/9-2.htm" title="I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?...">Job 9:2-13</a>. I have nothing left but to acknowledge my own vileness, and to make my supplication to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/9-14.htm" title="How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?...">Job 9:14-19</a>. But yet, as to any heinous crimes, beyond the common infirmities of human nature, these I disclaim; and let the event be what it will, I will rather part with my life than accuse myself wrongfully. And whereas you affirm, that affliction is an infallible mark of guilt, you quite mistake the matter; for afflictions are indifferently assigned to be the portion of the innocent and the guilty. God, indeed, sometimes in his anger destroys the wicked; but, doth he not as frequently afflict the innocent? The dispensations of providence, in this world, are frequently such, that, were it not that God now and then lets loose his fury against them, one would be almost tempted to imagine the rule of this world was delivered over into the hands of wicked men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/9-21.htm" title="Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life....">Job 9:21-24</a>. As for my own part, my days are almost come to an end: it is therefore labour lost for me to plead the cause of my innocence: besides, that in the sight of God I must appear all vileness; so that it is not for such a one as me to pretend to put myself on a level with him. And, even though I were able to do so, there is no one that hath sufficient authority to judge between us, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/9-25.htm" title="Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good....">Job 9:25-33</a>. Yet, were it his pleasure to grant me a little respite, I could say a great deal in my own vindication; but, as matters stand, I dare not; for which reason my life is a burden to me, and my desire is, it may speedily come to an end, chap. 10. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-1.htm" title="Then Job answered and said,">Job 9:1</a>, to the end. I would, however, expostulate a little with the Almighty.’ And here he enters into the most beautiful and tender pleading which heart can conceive; ending, as before, with a prayer, that his sufferings and life might soon come to a period; and that God would grant him some little respite before his departure hence.” — Heath and Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-13 In this answer Job declared that he did not doubt the justice of God, when he denied himself to be a hypocrite; for how should man be just with God? Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame - When they see your returning prosperity, and the evidences of the divine favor.

That is, God will favor the righteous, but punish the wicked. This opinion the friends of Job maintain all along, and by this they urge him to forsake his sins, repent, and return to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>FIRST SERIES.<p>Job 9:1-35.

Without taking notice of Bildad's harsh expressions and severe censures, or his unfriendliness to him; he enters directly into the argument, grants some things, confutes others, and defends himself and his conduct. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Job answered and said,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. It is not quite easy to see what form of the maxim of the friends it is to which Job gives his sneering assent in this verse, when he says, <span class="ital">To be sure I know that it is so</span>. In <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-10.htm" title="Which does great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number.">Job 9:10</a></span> he quotes words from Eliphaz, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-9.htm" title="Which does great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:">Job 5:9</a>, verbatim, and he may refer to the form in which this speaker put forward the principle common to them all, Shall man be righteous before God? ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm" title="Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?">Job 4:17</a>. In this case the second member of the verse merely explains the words <span class="ital">that it is so</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of a truth I know that it is so:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How shall man be righteous with God?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Job, however, gives a different turn to the words, meaning by them, How shall man substantiate his righteousness, and make it to appear, when he has to maintain it in the face of the overpowering might of God? (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-3.htm" title="If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.">Job 9:3</a></span>). Or, Job may attach his reply to Bildad’s question, Will God pervert right? (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm" title="Does God pervert judgment? or does the Almighty pervert justice?">Job 8:3</a>). To which he replies: Of course—but how shall man have right with God? God’s power makes right. Job does not quibble with words. He speaks from the point of view of his own circumstances and the construction which he put on them. His afflictions were proof that God held him guilty, while his own conscience declared his innocence. But he was helpless against God’s judgment of him. In the view of his friends and all men, and even himself, his afflictions were God’s verdict against him. And his answer is that man must be guilty before God because he cannot contend with an omnipotent power resolved to hold him guilty.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-35.</span> - Job, in answer to Bildad, admits the truth of his arguments, but declines to attempt the justification which can alone entitle him to accept the favourable side of Bildad's alternative. Man cannot absolutely justify himself before God. It is in vain to attempt to do so. The contest is too unequal. On the one side perfect wisdom and absolute strength (ver. 4); on the other, weakness, imperfection, ignorance. guilt (vers. 17-20). And no "daysman," or umpire, between them; no third party to hold the balance even, and preside authoritatively over the controversy, and see that justice is done (vers. 33-35). Were it otherwise, Job would not shrink from the controversy; but he thinks it ill arguing with omnipotent power. What he seems to lack is the absolute conviction expressed by Abraham in the emphatic words'" Shall not the Judge of all the earth <span class="accented">do</span> <span class="accented">right?"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Job answered and said, I know it is so of a truth</span>. "I freely admit," is., "all that has been said." God would not cast away a perfectly righteous man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-20.htm">Job 8:20</a>); and, of course, he punishes evil-doers. But, applied practically, what is the result? <span class="cmt_word">How should man be just with God?</span> or, <span class="accented">before</span> <span class="accented">God?</span> Apart from any knowledge of the doctrine of original or inherited sin, each man feels, deep in his heart, that he is sinful - "a chief of sinners." Bradford looks upon the murderer as he mounts the scaffold, and says, "But for the grace of God, there goes John Bradford!" Job has a similar conviction, that in the sight of God, righteousness, such as it is, shrinks away into insignificance, and is as nothing, cannot anyhow be relied upon. Such must be the attitude before God of every human soul that is not puffed up with pride or utterly insensate and sunk in apathy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  He dwells with sap in the sunshine,<p>And his branch spreads itself over his garden.<p>17  His roots intertwine over heaps of stone,<p>He looks upon a house of stones.<p>18  If He casts him away from his place,<p>It shall deny him: I have not seen thee.<p>19  Behold, thus endeth his blissful course,<p>And others spring forth from the dust.<p>The subject throughout is not the creeping-plant directly, but the ungodly, who is likened to it. Accordingly the expression of the thought is in part figurative and in part literal, &#1497;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-17.htm">Job 8:17</a>). As the creeper has stones before it, and by its interwindings, as it were, so rules them that it may call them its own (v. Gerlach: the exuberant growth twines itself about the walls, and looks proudly down upon the stony structure); so the ungodly regards his fortune as a solid structure, which he has quickly caused to spring up, and which seems to him imperishable. Ewald translates: he separates one stone from another; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, according to 217, g, he considers equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;, and signifies apart from one another; but although &#1495;&#1494;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1494;, according to its radical idea, may signify to split, pierce through, still &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, when used as a preposition, can signify nothing else but, within. Others, e.g., Rosenmller, translate: he marks a place of stones, i.e., meets with a layer of stones, against which he strikes himself; for this also &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; will not do. He who casts away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-18.htm">Job 8:18</a>) is not the house of stone, but God. He who has been hitherto prosperous, becomes now as strange to the place in which he flourished so luxuriantly, as if it had never seen him. Behold, that is the delight of his way (course of life), i.e., so fashioned, so perishable is it, so it ends. From the ground above which he sprouts forth, others grow up whose fate, when they have no better ground of confidence than he, is the same. After he has placed before Job both the blessed gain of him who trusts, and the sudden destruction of him who forgets, God, as the result of the whole, Bildad recapitulates: </body></html>
