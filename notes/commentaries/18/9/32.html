The light that has shined upon us was shining then in the heart of Job, and shines for ever in the pages of his book. Job felt, as he had been taught to feel, that in himself there not only was no hope, but no possibility of justification with God, unless there should be an umpire and impartial mediator, who could make the cause of both his own, and reconcile and unite the two in himself. It is useless to inquire what other particular form the aspiration of Job may have taken, or how far he understood and meant what he said; but here are his words, and this is what they must mean, and it is for us to adore the wisdom by which they were taught accurately to correspond with what we know has been given to us by God. We know that a daysman has laid his hand upon us both; and while we see that this is what Job wanted, we cannot but see more plainly that this is what we want. It is to be observed that this word daysman, or judge, is immediately connected with the Scripture phrase, “the <span class= "ital">day </span>of the Lord,” and St. Paul’s words, “the <span class= "ital">day </span>shall declare it” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1Corinthians 3:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/9-32.htm" title="For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment....">Job 9:32-33</a></span>. <span class="ital">For he is not a man as I am — </span>But one infinitely superior to me in majesty and power, wisdom and justice. <span class="ital">That I should answer him</span> — That I should presume to debate my cause with him, or answer his allegations against me. <span class="ital">That we should come together in judgment — </span>Face to face, to plead upon equal terms. <span class="ital">Neither is there any days-man — </span>Or, <span class="ital">umpire; that might lay his hand upon us both — </span>Order and govern us in pleading, and oblige us to stand to his decision. The laying the hand on both parties implies a coercive power to enforce the execution of his decrees. This no one could have over the Almighty: it was in vain, therefore, to contend with him. Our Lord Jesus Christ is now the blessed daysman, who has mediated between heaven and earth, <span class="ital">has laid his hand upon </span>us both: to him the Father hath committed all judgment. But this was not made so clear then as it is now by the gospel, which leaves no room for such a complaint as this.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:25-35 What little need have we of pastimes, and what great need to redeem time, when it runs on so fast towards eternity! How vain the enjoyments of time, which we may quite lose while yet time continues! The remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so will not the remembrance of having got worldly wealth, when it is all lost and gone. Job's complaint of God, as one that could not be appeased and would not relent, was the language of his corruption. There is a Mediator, a Daysman, or Umpire, for us, even God's own beloved Son, who has purchased peace for us with the blood of his cross, who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God through him. If we trust in his name, our sins will be buried in the depths of the sea, we shall be washed from all our filthiness, and made whiter than snow, so that none can lay any thing to our charge. We shall be clothed with the robes of righteousness and salvation, adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit, and presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. May we learn the difference between justifying ourselves, and being thus justified by God himself. Let the tempest-tossed soul consider Job, and notice that others have passed this dreadful gulf; and though they found it hard to believe that God would hear or deliver them, yet he rebuked the storm, and brought them to the desired haven. Resist the devil; give not place to hard thoughts of God, or desperate conclusions about thyself. Come to Him who invites the weary and heavy laden; who promises in nowise to cast them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he is not a man as I am - He is infinitely superior to me in majesty and power. The idea is, that the contest would be unequal, and that he might as well surrender without bringing the matter to an issue. It is evident that the disposition of Job to yield, was rather because he saw that God was superior in power than because he saw that he was right, and that he felt that if he had ability to manage the cause as well as God could, the matter would not be so much against him as it was then. That there was no little impropriety of feeling in this, no one can doubt; but have we never had feelings like this when we have been afflicted? Have we never submitted to God because we felt that he was Almighty, and that it was vain to contend with him, rather than because he was seen to be right? True submission is always accompanied with the belief that God is RIGHT - whether we can see him to be right or not.<p>And we should come together in judgment - For trial, to have the case adjudicated. That is, that we should meet face to face, and have the cause tried before a superior judge.

For though the parts and members of an human body are sometimes ascribed to him, yet these are to be understood by an anthropopathy, speaking after the manner of men, there being something in him, which in a figurative sense answers to these; otherwise we are not to conceive of any corporeal shape in him, or that there is any likeness to which he is to be compared: he is a spirit infinite, immortal, immense, invisible, pure and holy, just and true, and without iniquity; whereas Job was but a man, a finite, feeble, mortal creature, and a sinful one; and therefore there being such a vast disparity between them, it was in vain to litigate a point with him, to plead his cause before him, or attempt to vindicate his innocence; the potsherds may strive and contend with the potsherds of the earth their equals, but not with God their Creator, who is more than a match for them; he sees impurity where man sees it not, and can bring a charge against him, and support it, where he thought there was none, and therefore it is a vain thing to enter the lists with him: <p>that I should answer him; not to questions put by him, but in a judicial way to charges and accusations he should exhibit; no man in this sense can answer him, for one of a thousand he may bring, and men are chargeable with; wherefore Job once and again determines he would not pretend to answer him, as he knew he could not, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-3.htm">Job 9:3</a>, <p>and we should come together in judgment; in any court of judicature, before any judge, to have the cause between us heard, and tried, and determined; for in what court of judicature can he be convened into? or what judge is there above him, before whom he can be summoned? or is capable of judging and determining the cause between us? there is the high court of heaven, where we must all appear, and the judgment seat of Christ, before which we must all stand; and God is the judge of all, to whom we must come, and by whose sentence we must be determined; but there is no court, no judge, no judgment superior to him and his; there is no annulling his sentence, or making an appeal from him to another; there is no coming together at all, and much less "alike" (p), as some render it, or upon equal terms; the difference between him and his creatures being so vastly great. <p>(p) "pariter", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Drusius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32–34</span>. The preceding verses described how unavailing all Job’s efforts were to make out his innocence in the face of the fixed resolution of God to hold him guilty. Now Job comes back to what is the real difficulty,—God is not a man like himself.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him; and we should come together in judgment</span> (comp. vers. 2-14). On one of two conditions only, Job thinks, could the contest be even between himself and God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If God, divesting himself of all his Divine attributes, became man; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if some thirdsman could be found, some umpire or arbitrator, to preside over the contest, and decide it. Neither condition, however, was (he thought) possible; and therefore no satisfactory judgment could take place. Recent commentators observe that the Christian scheme, which Job could not anticipate, provides almost a literal fulfilment of both conditions, since the God who is to judge us is "true Man," and is also a Mediator, or "Thirds-man," between us and the offended Father, with authority to make the final decision, 'the Father having committed all judgment unto the Son "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), and" given him authority to execute judgment also'" for the very reason that he is "the Son of man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm">John 5:27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>25  My days were swifter than a runner,<p>They fled away without seeing prosperity,<p>26  They shot by as ships of reeds,<p>As an eagle which dasheth upon its prey.<p>27  If my thought is: I will forget my complaint,<p>I will give up my dark looks and look cheerful;<p>28  I shudder at all my pains,<p>I feel that Thou dost not pronounce me innocent.<p>Such, as described in the preceding strophe, is the lot of the innocent in general, and such (this is the connection) is also Job's lot: his swiftly passing life comes to an end amidst suffering, as that of an evil-doer whom God cuts off in judgment. In the midst of his present sufferings he has entirely forgotten his former prosperity; it is no happiness to him, because the very enjoyment of it makes the loss of it more grievous to bear. The days of prosperity are gone, have passed swiftly away without &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, i.e., without lasting prosperity. They have been swifter &#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;. By reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-6.htm">Job 7:6</a>, this might be considered as a figure borrowed from the weaver's loom, since in the Coptic the threads of the weft (fila subteminis) which are wound round the shuttle are called "runners" (vid., Ges. Thesaurus); but Rosenmller has correctly observed that, in order to describe the fleetness of his life, Job brings together that which is swiftest on land (the runners or couriers), in water (fast-sailing ships), and in the air (the swooping eagle). &#1506;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>, signifies, in comparison with, aeque ac. But we possess only a rather uncertain tradition as to the kind of vessels meant by &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;. Jerome translates, after the Targ.: naves poma portantes, by which one may understand the small vessels, according to Edrisi, common on the Dead Sea, in which corn and different kinds of fruits were carried from Zoar to Jericho and to other regions of the Jordan (Stickel, S. 267); but if &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; were connected with &#1488;&#1489;, we might rather expect &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, after the form &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; (from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;), instead of &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;. Others derive the word from &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, avere: ships of desire, i.e., full-rigged and ready for sea (Gecatilia in Ges. Thes. suppl. p. 62), or struggling towards the goal (Kimchi), or steering towards (Zamora), and consequently hastening to (Symmachuc, &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), the harbour; but independently of the explanation not being suited to the description, it should then be accented beh, after the form &#1504;&#1491;&#1492;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1492;, instead of bh. The explanation, ships of hostility (Syr.),<p>(Note: Luther also perhaps understood pirate ships, when he translated, "wie die starcken Schiff.")<p>i.e., ships belonging to pirates or freebooters, privateers, which would suit the subject well, is still less admissible with the present pointing of the text, as it must then be &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;), with which the Egyptian uba, against, and adverse (contrarius), may be compared. According to Abulwalid (Parchon, Raschi), &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; is the name of a large river near the scene of the book of Job; which may be understood as either the Babylonian name for river Arab. 'bby, or the Abyssinian name of the Nile, ab; and &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; may be compared with &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; in relation to the Arabic, lubna. But a far more satisfactory explanation is the one now generally received, according to the comparison with the Arabic aba&#770;'un, a reed (whence abaa-t-un, a reed, a so-called n. unitatis): ships made from reeds, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>, vessels of papyrus, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. In such small ships, with Egyptian tackling, they used to travel as far as Taprobane. These canoes were made to fold together, plicatiles, so that they could be carried past the cataracts; Heliodorus describes them as &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;.<p>(Note: There is no Egyptian word which can be compared to &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, whereas han (hani) or an (ana) in Egyptian, like the Hebrew &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, means a ship (vid., Chabas, Le Papyrus magique Harris, p. 246, No. 826, cf. pp. 33, 47); it is written with the sign for set  equals  downwards, since they fastened a stone at the front of the vessel, as was even known to Herodotus, in order to accelerate its speed in descending the river. From this one might conjecture for the passage before us &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  swift sailers.)<p>The third figure is the eagle, which swoops down upon its prey; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;, like Chaldee &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, by which the Targ. translates &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; Grtz' conjecture of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; (which is intended to mean flutters) is superfluous. Just as unnecessary is it, with Olshausen, to change &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; into &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;: "if my saying (thinking)" is equivalent to, "as often as I say (think)." &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is here (as in the German phrase, ein Gesicht machen) an ill-humoured, distorted, wry face. When Job desires to give up this look of suffering and be cheerful (&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490;, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>, hilaritatem prae se ferre, vultum hilarem induere), the certainty that he is not favoured of God, and consequently that he cannot be delivered from his sufferings, all his anguish in spite of his struggles against it comes ever afresh before his mind. It is scarcely necessary to remark that &#1514;&#1504;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497; is addressed to God, not to Bildad. It is important to notice that Job does not speak of God without at the same time looking up to Him as in prayer. Although he feels rejected of God, he still remains true to God. In the following strophe he continues to complain of God, but without denying Him. </body></html>
