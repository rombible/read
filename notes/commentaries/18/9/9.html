Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which maketh Arcturus - This verse, with others of the same description in the book of Job, is of special importance, as they furnish an illustration of the views which prevailed among the patriarchs on the subject of astronomy. There are frequent references to the sciences in this book (see the Introduction), and there is no source of illustration of the views which prevailed in the earliest times in regard to the state of the sciences, so copious as can be found in this poem. The thoughts of people were early turned to the science of astronomy. Not only were they led to this by the beauty of the heavens, and by the instinctive promptings of the human mind to know something about them, but the attention of the Chaldeans and of the other Oriental nations was early drawn to them by the fact that they were shepherds, and that they passed much of their time in the open air at night, watching their flocks.<p>Having nothing else to do, and being much awake, they would naturally contrive to relieve the tediousness of the night by watching the movements of the stars; and they early gave employment to their talents, by endeavoring to ascertain the influence which the stars exerted over the fates of people, and to their imagination, by dividing the heavens into portions, having a fancied resemblance to certain animals, and by giving them appropriate names. Hence, arose the arrangement of the stars into constellations, and the names which they still bear. The Hebrew word rendered Arcturus, is &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;  &#8219;ay&#305;&#770;sh. The Septuagint renders it, &#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;  Pleiada - the Pleiades. Jerome, Arcturum. The Hebrew word usually means a moth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-18.htm">Job 27:18</a>. It also denotes the splendid constellation in the northern hemisphere, which we call Ursa Major, the Great Bear, Arcturus, or the Wain; compare Niebuhr, Des. of Arabia, p. 114.<p>The word &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;  &#8219;ay&#305;&#770;sh does not literally mean a bear, but is made by aphaeresis from the Arabic nas, by the excision of the initial n - as is common in Arabic; see Bochart, Hieroz. P. II. Lib. I. c. xvi. p. 113, 114. The word in Arabic means a bier, and is the name given to the constellation which we denominate Ursa Major, "because," says Bochart, "the four stars, which are a square, are regarded as a bier, on which a dead body is borne. The three following (the tail of the bear) are the daughters or sons which attend the funeral as mourners." This name is often given to this constellation in Arabic. The Arabic name is Elna'sch, the bier. "The expression," says Ideler, "denotes particularly the bier on which the dead are borne, and taken in this sense, each of the two biers in the Ursa Major and Ursa Minor is accompanied by three mourning-women. The biers and the mourning-women together, are called Bena&#770;tna'sch, literally, daughters of the bier; that is, those who pertain to the bier."<p>Untersuchungen uber den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der Sternnamen, S. 419; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a> : "Canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?" Schultens regards the word &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;  &#8219;ay&#305;&#770;sh as synonymous with the Arabic asson, night-vigil, from assa to go about by night, and supposes this constellation to be so called, because it always revolves around the pole, and never sets. The situation and figure of this constellation are well known. It is seen at all times in the northern part of the heavens, perpetually revolving around the North Star, and two of its principal stars point to the North Star always. Its resemblance to a bear, is quite fanciful - as it might be imagined as well to resemble any other object. The design of this fancy was merely to assist the memory. The only thing which seems to have suggested it was its slight resemblance to an animal followed by its young. Thus, the stars, now known as the "tail," might have been supposed to resemble the cubs of a bear following their dam.<p>The comparison of the constellation to a bier, and the movement to a funeral procession, with the sons or daughters of the deceased following on in the mourning train, is much more poetical and beautiful. This constellation is so conspicuous, that it has been an object of interest in all ages, and has been one of the groups of stars most attentively observed by navigators, as a guide in sailing. The reason was, probably, that as it constantly revolved around the North Pole, it could always be seen in clear weather, and thus the direction in which they were sailing, could always be told. It has had a great variety of names. The name Ursa Major, or the Great Bear, is that which is commonly given to it. It is a remarkable fact, also, that while this name was given to it in the East a tribe of the American Indians - the Iroquois, also gave the same name of the Great Bear to it. This is remarkable, because, so far as known, they had no communication with each other, and because the name is perfectly arbitrary.<p>Is this an evidence that the natives of our country, North America, derived their origin from some of the nations of the East? In some parts of England the constellation is called "Charles' Wain," or Wagon, from its fancied resemblance to a waggon, drawn by three horses in a line. Others call it the Plow. The whole number of visible stars in this constellation is eighty seven, of which one is of the first, three of the second, seven of the third, and about twice as many of the fourth magnitude. The constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor were represented by the ancients, under the image of a waggon drawn by a team of horses. This is alluded to by the Greek poet, Aratus, in an address to the Athenians:<p>The one called Helix, soon as day retires.<p>Observed with ease lights up his radiant fires;<p>The other smaller and with feebler beams,<p>In a less circle drives his lazy teams:<p>But more adapted for the sailor's guide,<p>Whene'er by night he tempts the briny tide.<p>Among the Egyptians these two constellations are represented by the figures of bears, instead of waggons. Whence the Hebrew name is derived is not quite certain; but if it be from the Arabic, it probably means the same - a bier. There seems no reason to doubt, however, that the Ursa Major is intended; and that the idea here is, that the greatness of God is shown by his having made this beautiful constellation.<p>Orion - The Vulgate renders this Orion, the Septuagint, "&#x395;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  Hesperon, Hesperus - that is, the evening star, Venus. The word &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;  kes&#305;&#770;yl, is from &#1499;&#1505;&#1500;  ka&#770;sal, to be fat or fleshy; to be strong, lusty, firm; and then to be dull, sluggish, stupid - as fat persons usually are. Hence, the word &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;  kes&#305;&#770;yl means a fool, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>, It is used here, however, to denote a constellation, and by most interpreters it is supposed to denote the constellation Orion, which the Orientals call a giant. "They appear to have conceived of this constellation under the figure of an impious giant bound upon the sky." Gesenius. Hence the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>; "Canst thou loose the bands of Orion?" According to the Eastern tradition, this giant was Nimrod, the founder of Babylon, afterward translated to the skies; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>, where it is rendered constellation. Virgil speaks of it as the Stormy Orion:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. maketh&#8212;rather, from the Arabic, "covereth up." This accords better with the context, which describes His boundless power as controller rather than as creator [Umbreit].<p>Arcturus&#8212;the great bear, which always revolves about the pole, and never sets. The Chaldeans and Arabs, early named the stars and grouped them in constellations; often travelling and tending flocks by night, they would naturally do so, especially as the rise and setting of some stars mark the distinction of seasons. Brinkley, presuming the stars here mentioned to be those of Taurus and Scorpio, and that these were the cardinal constellations of spring and autumn in Job's time, calculates, by the precession of equinoxes, the time of Job to be eight hundred eighteen years after the deluge, and one hundred eighty-four before Abraham.<p>Orion&#8212;Hebrew, "the fool"; in Job 38:31 he appears fettered with "bands." The old legend represented this star as a hero, who presumptuously rebelled against God, and was therefore a fool, and was chained in the sky as a punishment; for its rising is at the stormy period of the year. He is Nimrod (the exceedingly impious rebel) among the Assyrians; Orion among the Greeks. Sabaism (worship of the heavenly hosts) and hero-worship were blended in his person. He first subverted the patriarchal order of society by substituting a chieftainship based on conquest (Ge 10:9, 10).<p>Pleiades&#8212;literally, "the heap of stars"; Arabic, "knot of stars." The various names of this constellation in the East express the close union of the stars in it (Am 5:8).<p>chambers of the south&#8212;the unseen regions of the southern hemisphere, with its own set of stars, as distinguished from those just mentioned of the northern. The true structure of the earth is here implied.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Maketh; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Arcturus is a northern constellation, near that called the Bear, which riseth to us about the beginning of September, and by its rising produceth (as Pliny affirms) horrible storms and tempests. Orion is a more southerly constellation, that ariseth to us in December, and is noted by astronomers for raising fearful winds and tempests, both by sea and land. The Pleiades is a constellation not far from Orion, and near that called the Bull, which we call the Seven Stars: to us it riseth at the beginning of the spring, and by its rising causeth rains and tempests, and therefore is unwelcome to mariners at sea. <span class="ital">By the chambers</span> (or <span class="ital">inmost and secret chambers</span>, as the word signifies) <span class="ital">of the south</span>, he seems to understand those stars and constellations which are towards the southern pole, which are fitly called <span class="ital">inward chambers</span>, because they are for the most part hid and shut up (as chambers commonly are) from these parts of the world, and do not rise or appear to us till the beginning of summer, when they also raise southerly winds and tempests, as astronomers observe. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Which maketh Arcturus,....

Aben Ezra understands it of the seven stars, but these are thought to be meant by the Pleiades, later mentioned; this constellation is about the Arctic or northern pole, in the tail of the Bear, appears in the beginning of September, and brings stormy weather, when winter is at hand (h): <p>Orion and Pleiades; the former of these also is not a single star, but a constellation; by the help of a telescope no less than two thousand are numbered, and in Hebrew it is called "Cesil"; hence the month "Cisleu" has its name, which answers to part of November and part of December, at which time this constellation is seen, and is attended with stormy weather; hence Virgil calls it Nimbosus Orion (i): and the latter are what we call the Seven Stars, sometimes by writers called Vergiliae, because they appear in the spring; and have their name of Pleiades from sailing, because at this time of year mariners go out with their ships; though some say this constellation is not favourable to them, causing rains and tempests (k); these three divide the whole year: <p>and the chambers of the south: the stars in the southern hemisphere, about the Antarctic, or southern pole; and called "chambers", as Aben Ezra observes, because hidden, and are not seen by those in the other hemisphere, as if they were in a chamber: now the making of these is rightly ascribed to God, who made all the stars, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a>; though this may rather regard the continuance of them in their being, who calls them by name, brings out their host by number, directs their course, keeps them in their orbs, and preserves their influence. <p>(h) Sophoclis Oedipus, Tyran. ver. 1147.

Rather Job has in his mind those immense spaces of the sky which lie behind his southern horizon; how far extending, he knows not. Though the circumnavigation of Africa was not effected until about r c. 600, yet it is not improbable that he may have derived from travellers or merchants some knowledge of the Southern hemisphere.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then Job began, and said:<p>  2  Yea, indeed, I know it is thus,<p>And how should a man be just with God!<p>  3  Should he wish to contend with God,<p>He could not answer Him one of a thousand.<p>  4  The wise in heart and mighty in strength,<p>Who hath defied Him and remained unhurt?<p>Job does not (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-1.htm">Job 9:1</a>) refer to what Eliphaz said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17</a>), which is similar, though still not exactly the same; but "indeed I know it is so" must be supposed to be an assert to that which Bildad had said immediately before. The chief thought of Bildad's speech was, that God does not pervert what is right. Certainly (&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;, scilicet, nimirum, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>), - says Job, as he ironically confirms this maxim of Bildad's, - it is so: what God does is always right, because God does it; how could man maintain that he is in the right in opposition to God! If God should be willing to enter into controversy with man, he would not be able to give Him information on one of a thousand subjects that might be brought into discussion; he would be so confounded, so disarmed, by reason of the infinite distance of the feeble creature from his Creator. The attributes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4</a>) belong not to man (Olshausen), but to God, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-5.htm">Job 36:5</a>.
