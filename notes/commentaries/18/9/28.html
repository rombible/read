How vain the enjoyments of time, which we may quite lose while yet time continues! The remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so will not the remembrance of having got worldly wealth, when it is all lost and gone. Job's complaint of God, as one that could not be appeased and would not relent, was the language of his corruption. There is a Mediator, a Daysman, or Umpire, for us, even God's own beloved Son, who has purchased peace for us with the blood of his cross, who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God through him. If we trust in his name, our sins will be buried in the depths of the sea, we shall be washed from all our filthiness, and made whiter than snow, so that none can lay any thing to our charge. We shall be clothed with the robes of righteousness and salvation, adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit, and presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. May we learn the difference between justifying ourselves, and being thus justified by God himself. Let the tempest-tossed soul consider Job, and notice that others have passed this dreadful gulf; and though they found it hard to believe that God would hear or deliver them, yet he rebuked the storm, and brought them to the desired haven. Resist the devil; give not place to hard thoughts of God, or desperate conclusions about thyself. Come to Him who invites the weary and heavy laden; who promises in nowise to cast them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am afraid of all my sorrows - My fears return.

That they would return upon him, and surround him, and overwhelm him, so that he should not be able to stand up against them, or under them; that they would increase and continue with him, and so he should never be released from them: <p>I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent: a sudden apostrophe to God as near him; the meaning is not, that he was confident that God would not justify him but condemn him in a spiritual sense; Job did not despair of his everlasting salvation, he knew and believed in his living Redeemer; he knew he should be acquitted and justified by his righteousness, and not be condemned with the world; but he was certain of this, as he thought that God would neither "cleanse" (k) him, as some render the word, from the worms his flesh was clad with, and from the filthy boils and ulcers he was covered with; nor clear him so as that he should appear to be innocent in the sight and judgment of his friends; but go on to treat him as if he was a guilty person, by continuing his afflictions on him, even unto death; he had no hope of being freed from them, and so of being cleared from the imputation of his friends, who judged of him by his outward circumstances. <p>(k)   "quod non mundabis me", Montanus, Bolducius, Beza. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. As Job’s afflictions were the proof of his guilt in the estimation of God, “to hold him innocent” means to remove his afflictions, as the first clause suggests.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am afraid of all my sorrows</span> (see the comment on ver. 27). <span class="cmt_word">I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent</span>. The worst of all Job's sorrows is the sense of alienation from God, which his unexampled sufferings have wrought in him. Though unconscious of having deserved them, he still, not unnaturally, looks upon them as marks of God s displeasure, proofs that God does not regard him as innocent. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  Whether I am innocent, I know not myself,<p>My life is offensive to me.<p>22  There is one thing-therefore I maintain - :<p>The innocent and wicked He destroyeth.<p>23  If the scourge slay suddenly,<p>He laugheth at the melting away of the innocent.<p>24  Countries are given into the hand of the wicked;<p>The countenance of its rulers He veileth - <p>Is it not so, who else doeth it?<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-21.htm">Job 9:21</a> is usually considered to be an affirmation of innocence on the part of Job, though without effect, and even at the peril of his own destruction: "I am innocent, I boldly say it even with scorn of my life" (Schnurr., Hirz., Ewald, Schlottm.). But although &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488; may mean: I care nothing for my soul, i.e., my life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-6.htm">Genesis 39:6</a>), its first meaning would be: I know not my soul, i.e., myself; and this sense is also quite in accordance with the context. He is innocent, but the contradiction between his lot and his innocence seems to show that his self-consciousness is deceptive, and makes him a mystery to himself, leads him astray respecting himself; and having thus become a stranger to himself, he abhors this life of seeming contradictions, for which he desires nothing less than its long continuance (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-16.htm">Job 7:16</a>). The &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; which follows we do not explain: "it is all the same to me whether I live or not," but: it is all one whether man is innocent or not. He himself is a proof of this; therefore he maintains, etc. It is, however, also possible that this expression, which is similar in meaning to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a> (there is one event, &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, to the righteous and to the wicked), and is well translated in the Targ. by &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488; &#1495;&#1491;&#1488; (there is one measure of retribution, &#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>), refers to what follows, and that "therefore I maintain" is parenthetical (like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-57.htm">Psalm 119:57</a>; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>), and we have translated it accordingly. There is certainly a kind of suspense, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; d introduces an assertion of Job, which is founded upon the fact of the continuance of his own misfortune, - an assertion which he advances in direct contradiction to the friends, and which is expressly censured by Elihu.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-23.htm">Job 9:23</a>., by some striking examples, he completes the description of that which seems to be supported by the conflict he is called to endure. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496;, a scourge, signifies a judgment which passes over a nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>). It swept off the guiltless as well, and therefore Job concludes that God delights in &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, trial, or perhaps more correctly the melting away (from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>) of the guiltless, i.e., their dissolution in anguish and dismay, their wearing away and despondency. Jerome rightly remarks that in the whole book Job says nihil asperius than what he says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-23.htm">Job 9:23</a>. Another example in favour of his disconsolate &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is that whole lands are given into the hand of the wicked: the monarch is an evil man, and the countenance of their judges He (God) covers, so that they do not distinguish between right and wrong, nor decide in favour of the former rather than of the latter. God himself is the final cause of the whole: if not, i.e., if it is not so, who can it then be that causes it? &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; (four times in the book of Job instead of the usual form &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488;) is, according to the current opinion, placed per hyperbaton in the conditional instead of the interrogative clause; and &#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; are certainly not, with Hirzel, to be taken together. There is, however, not a proper hyperbaton, but &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; here gives intensity to the question; though not directly as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a> (Ges. 153, 2), but only indirectly, by giving intensity to that which introduces the question, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-25.htm">Job 24:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-37.htm">Genesis 27:37</a>; translate therefore: if it really is not so (comp. the Homeric expression &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;). It is indisputable that God, and no one else, is the final cause of this misery, apparently so full of contradiction, which meets us in the history of mankind, and which Job now experiences for himself. </body></html>
