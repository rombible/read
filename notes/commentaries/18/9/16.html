Bishop Patrick’s paraphrase is, “If I had made supplication, and he had granted my desire, I would not think my prayer had done the business.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:14-21 Job is still righteous in his own eyes, ch. 32:1, and this answer, though it sets forth the power and majesty of God, implies that the question between the afflicted and the Lord of providence, is a question of might, and not of right; and we begin to discover the evil fruits of pride and of a self-righteous spirit. Job begins to manifest a disposition to condemn God, that he may justify himself, for which he is afterwards reproved. Still Job knew so much of himself, that he durst not stand a trial. If we say, We have no sin, we not only deceive ourselves, but we affront God; for we sin in saying so, and give the lie to the Scripture. But Job reflected on God's goodness and justice in saying his affliction was without cause.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I had called, and he had answered me - It is remarked by Schultens, that the expressions in these verses are all taken from courts of justice. If so, the meaning is, that even if Job should call the Almighty to a judicial action, and he should respond to him, and consent to submit the great question about his innocence, and about the justice of the divine dealings with him, to trial, yet that such was the distance between God and him, that he could not hope successfully to contend with him in the argument. He would, therefore, prostrate himself in a suppliant manner, and implore his mercy and compassion - submitting to him as having all power, and as being a just and righteous Sovereign.<p>Would I not believe - I cannot believe that he would enter into my complaint. He deals with me in a manner so severe; he acts toward me so much as a sovereign, that I have no reason to suppose that he would not continue to act toward me in the same way still. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17. would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice&#8212;who breaketh me (as a tree stripped of its leaves) with a tempest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If I had called, </span> i.e. prayed, as this word is commonly used, to wit, unto my Judge, for a favourable sentence, as he now said, and therefore it was needless here to mention the object of his calling or prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice; </span> I could not believe that God had indeed granted my desire, though he had done it; because I am so infinitely below him, and obnoxious to him, and still full of the tokens of his displeasure; and therefore should conclude that it was but a pleasant dream or fancy, and not a real thing: compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-1.htm" title="When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.">Psalm 126:1</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If I had called, and he had answered me,.... Mr. Broughton reads the words, "if I cry, will he answer me?" as if Job had some doubt upon his mind whether God would vouchsafe to answer him, though he should make his supplication to him, as he proposed; seeing he had so sorely afflicted him, and still continued his hand upon him; or the words may be rendered, "though I have called, and he has answered" (q), in times past. Job was a praying person, he had often prayed to God in his closet, and in his family, for himself, and for his children, and for his friends, and he had found God to be a God hearing and answering prayer, but seems to question whether he would answer him now, if he did pray to him: <p>yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice, or "would hearken" (r), at this time, and under the present circumstances; or should he, the mercy would be so great, that he could hardly believe it; so sometimes through joy men cannot believe what they hear and see, as the apostles, when Christ appeared to them after his resurrection; or as it was with the Jews returned from Babylon, they were like them that dream, they could scarcely tell whether their deliverance was a real fact, or whether they only dreamed of it, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a>; so Job intimates, that should he pray to God, and be heard and delivered, it would be so astonishing and transporting, that at first he should not be able to give credit to it; or, however, he should not believe that it was for his prayers and supplications, for any worth and value, virtue and efficacy, there was in them, that he was heard; but it must be purely for his mercy's sake, for the sake of the mediation of Christ, and because these prayers were the breathings of his own spirit: or else the sense is, that though he had heard and answered him formerly, when he prayed in a supplicating way, yet if he should contend with him in a judicial way, and insist upon his own righteousness, and present his supplication to God on that account, he could never expect to be heard; and, indeed, he could not believe he should be heard on any account, so long as his present sufferings lasted; which seems to be the sense of what follows, where he gives his reasons for such belief, or rather unbelief. <p>(q)   "etiamsi clamavi et respondit mihi", Schmidt.

But parallel passages, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>, and especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>, show that <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a> is to be understood as referring to the creation of the firmament of heaven; and consequently &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; is to be taken in the sense of expandere, and is a form of expression naturally occurring in connection with the mention of the waters which are separated by means of the &#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;. The question arises, whether &#1497;&#1501; here means the sea of waters above the firmament or upon the earth. According to the idea of the ancients, the waters which descend as rain have their habitation far away in the infinite expanse of the sky; the ocean of the sky (Egyptian Nun-pa), through which the sun-god Ra sails every day, is there. It is possible that "the heights of the sea" here, and perhaps also "the roots of the sea" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-30.htm">Job 36:30</a>), may mean this ocean of the sky, as Hahn and Schlottmann suppose. But it is not necessary to adopt such an explanation, and it is moreover hazardous, since this conception of the celestial &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; is not found elsewhere (apart from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>). Why may not &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, which is used of the heights of the clouds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-14.htm">Isaiah 14:14</a>), be used also of the waves of the sea which mount up towards heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a>)? God walks over them as man walks on level ground (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;); they rise or lie calmly beneath His feel according to His almighty will (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-15.htm">Habakkuk 3:15</a>).<p>Job next describes God as the Creator of the stars, by introducing a constellation of the northern (the Bear), one of the southern (Orion), and one of the eastern sky (the Pleiades). &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, contracted from &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, Arabic na&#8219;s&#780;, a bier, is the constellation of seven stars (septentrio or septentriones) in the northern sky. The Greater and the Lesser Bear form a square, which the Arabs regarded as a bier; the three other stars, bena&#770;th n&#8219;asch, i.e., daughters of the bier (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>), seem to be the mourners. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; is Orion chained to the sky, which the ancients regarded as a powerful giant, and also as an insolent, foolish fellow <p>(Note: The Arabic ja&#770;hil is similar, which combines the significations, an ignorant, foolhardy, and passionate man (vid., Fleischer, Ali's hundert Sprche, S. 115f.).)<p>(K. O. Mller, Kleine deutsche Schriften, ii. 125). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; is the Pleiades, a constellation consisting of seven large and other smaller stars, Arabic turayya&#770;, which, like the Hebrew (comp. Arab. ku&#770;mat, cumulus), signifies the heap, cluster (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>), and is compared by the Persian poets to a bouquet formed of jewels. It is the constellation of seven stars, whose rising and setting determined the commencement and end of their voyages (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2;, probably  equals  constellation of navigation), and is to be distinguished from the northern septentriones. &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503; &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; are, according to the Targ., the chambers of the constellations on the south side of the heavens, as also most expositors explain them (Mercier: sidera quae sunt in altero hemisphaerio versus alterum polum antarcticum), according to which &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503;, or written defectively &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;, would therefore be equivalent to &#1514;&#1502;&#1503; &#1499;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;; or perhaps, in a more general meaning, the regions of the southern sky (penetralia), which are veiled, or altogether lost to view (Hirzel). In v. 10, Job says, almost verbatim, what Eliphaz had said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>). Job agrees with the friends in the recognition of the power of God, and intentionally describes those phases of it which display its terrible majesty. But while the friends deduce from this doctrine the duty of a humble deportment on the part of the sufferer, Job uses it to support the cheerless truth that human right can never be maintained in opposition to the absolute God. </body></html>
