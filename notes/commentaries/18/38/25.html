As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who hath divided a water-course for the overflowing of waters - That is, for the waters that flow down from the clouds. The idea seems to be this, that the waters of heaven, instead of pouring down in floods, or all coming down together, seemed to flow in certain canals formed for them; as if they had been cut out through the clouds for that purpose. The causes of rain, the manner in which water was suspended in the clouds, and the reasons why the rain did not come down altogether in floods, early attracted attention, and gave occasion to investigation. The subject is more than once referred to in this book; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>.<p>Or a way for the lightning of thunder - For the thunder-flash. The idea is this: a path seems to be opened in the dark cloud for the passage of the flash of lightning. How such a path was made, by what agency or by what laws, was the question proposed for inquiry. The lightning seemed at once to burst through the dark cloud where there was no opening and no sign of a path before, and pursue its zig-zag journey as if all obstructions were removed, and it passed over a beaten path. The question is, who could have traced out this path for the thunder-flash to go in? Who could do it but the Almighty? And still, with all the light that science has cast on the subject, we may repeat the question. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. waters&#8212;Rain falls, not in a mass on one spot, but in countless separate canals in the air marked out for them.<p>way for the lightning&#8212;(Job 28:26).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For the overflowing of waters; </span> for the showers of rain which come down out of the clouds, orderly, moderately, and gradually, as if they were conveyed in pipes or channels; which, without the care of God’s providence, would fall confusedly, and all together; and, instead of refreshing, would overwhelm the earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the lightning of thunder, </span> i.e. for that lightning which, breaking out of the cloud with violence, causeth thunder.

For a very large shower of rain, as the Vulgate Latin version: for this is not to be understood of an aqueduct, channel, or canal made on earth, either for the draining of waters off of land overflowed thereby, or for the conveyance of it to different parts to overflow it; such as were cut out of the Nile in Egypt, for the overflowing of the land, to make it fruitful; such may be and have been made by men: but of a watercourse in the air or atmosphere, as a canal or channel, for the rain to come down upon the earth; and this is the work of God, and him only, who directs and steers the course of rain, that it falls regularly and gently, not in spouts and floods, but in drops larger or lesser, on what spot of ground, or part of the earth, he pleases: and if what Jarchi says true, that every drop has its course, its canal, through which it passes, it is still more wonderful; <p>or a way for the lightning of thunder: which generally go together, and are of God. His fire and voice, and for which he makes a way, by which they burst and break forth out of the cloud, and their course is directed by him under the whole heavens; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-26.htm">Job 28:26</a>. So the Gospel, compared to rain and lightning, has its direction and its course steered to what part of the world, he pleases; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">for the overflowing of waters</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">for the rain-flood</span>.

The wadies of Syria and Arabia seem to be alluded to. They too are God's work, not Job's. <span class="cmt_word">Or a way for the lightning of thunder?</span> The "way" for the passage of the electric current is not marked out beforehand, like the way for the escape of the superfluous waters; but it is equally determined on and arranged previously by God, who has laid down the laws which it is bound to follow. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  Hast thou reached the fountains of the sea,<p>And hast thou gone into the foundation of the deep?<p>17  Were the gates of death unveiled to thee,<p>And didst thou see the gates of the realm of shades?<p>18  Hast thou comprehended the breadth of the earth?<p>Speak, in so far as thou knowest all this!<p>19  Which is the way to where the light dwelleth,<p>And darkness, where is its place,<p>20  That thou mightest bring it to its bound,<p>And that thou mightest know the paths of its house?<p>21  Thou knowest it, for then wast thou born,<p>And the number of thy days is great! - <p>The root &#1504;&#1489; has the primary notion of obtruding itself upon the senses (vid., Genesis, S. 635), whence &#1504;&#1489;&#1498; in Arabic of a rising country that pleases the eye (nabaka, a hill, a hillside), and here (cognate in root and meaning &#1504;&#1489;&#1506;, Syr.

Hitzig's conjecture, approved by Olsh., &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, sets aside a word that is perfectly clear so far as the language is concerned. On &#1495;&#1511;&#1512; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>. The question put to Job in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>, he must, according to his own confession, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>, answer in the negative. In order to avoid the collision of two aspirates, the interrogative &#1492; is wanting before &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;, Ew. 324, b; &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1503; &#1506;&#1491; signifies, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a>, to observe anything carefully; the meaning of the question therefore is, whether Job has given special attention to the breadth of the earth, and whether he consequently has a comprehensive and thorough knowledge of it. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers not to the earth (Hahn, Olsh., and others), but, as neuter, to the preceding points of interrogation. The questions, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-19.htm">Job 38:19</a>, refer to the principles of light and darkness, i.e., their final causes, whence they come forth as cosmical phenomena. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; is a relative clause, Ges. 123, 3, c; the noun that governs (the Regens) this virtual genitive, which ought in Arabic to be without the art. as being determined by the regens, is, according to the Hebrew syntax, which is freer in this respect, &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (comp. Ges. 110, 2). That which is said of the bound of darkness, i.e., the furthest point at which darkness passes away, and the paths to its house, applies also to the light, which the poet perhaps has even prominently (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>) before his mind: light and darkness have a first cause which is inaccessible to man, and beyond his power of searching out. The admission in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-21.htm">Job 38:21</a> is ironical: Verily! thou art as old as the beginning of creation, when light and darkness, as powers of nature which are distinguished and bounded the one by the other (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-10.htm">Job 26:10</a>), were introduced into the rising world; thou art as old as the world, so that thou hast an exact knowledge of its and thine own contemporaneous origin (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>).

The attraction in connection with &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>. </body></html>
