As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who provideth for the raven his food? - The same thought is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>,<p>He giveth to the beast his food,<p>And to the young ravens which cry.<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>. Scbeutzer (in loc.) suggests that the reason why the raven is specified here rather than other fowls is, that it is an offensive bird, and that God means to state that no object, however regarded by man, is beneath his notice. He carefully provides for the needs of all his creatures.<p>When his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat - Bochart observes that the raven expels the young from the nest as soon as they are able to fly. In this condition, being unable to obtain food by their own exertions, they make a croaking noise, and God is said to hear it, and to supply their needs. "Noyes." There are various opinions expressed in regard to this subject by the rabbinical writers, and by the ancients generally. Eliezer (cap. 21) says that, "When the old ravens see the young coming into the world which are not black, they regard them as the offspring of serpents, and flee away from them, and God takes care of them." Solomon says that in this condition they are nourished by the flies and worms that are generated in their nests, and the same opinion was held by the Arabian writers, Haritius, Alkuazin, and Damir. Among the fathers of the church, Chrysostom, Olympiodorus, Gregory, and Isidorus, supposed that they were nurtured by dew descending from heaven.<p>Pliny (Lib. x. c. 12) says, that the old ravens expel the strongest of their young from the nest, and compel them to fly. This is the time, according to many of the older commentators, when the young ravens are represented as calling upon God for food. See Scheutzer, Physica Sacra, in loc. and Bochart, Hieroz. P. ii. L. ii. c. ii. I do not know that there is now supposed to be sufficient evidence to substantiate this fact in regard to the manner in which the ravens treat their young, and all the circumstances of the place before us will be met by the supposition that young birds seem to call upon God, and that he supplies their needs. The last three verses in this chapter should not have been separated from the following. The appeal in this is to the animal creation, and this is continued through the whole of the next chapter. The proper place for the division would have been at the close of <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-38.htm">Job 38:38</a>, where the argument from the great laws of the material universe was ended. Then commences an appeal to his works of a higher order - the region of instinct and appetites, where creatures are governed by other than mere physical laws. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41.

The raven. The question extends to the end of the verse,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who provideth for the raven his food,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>When his young ones cry unto God,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And wander without meat?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The raven is one of the commonest birds in Palestine; by its incessant croaking it presses itself upon the attention, and is often alluded to in Scripture. The cry of its young is an appeal unto God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm" title="The beasts of the field cry also to you: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.">Joel 1:20</a>), and the feeding of it is proof of His universal providence, which does not overlook even the least of His creatures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-9.htm" title="He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.">Psalm 147:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-24.htm" title="Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are you better than the fowls?">Luke 12:24</a>). The lion and the raven are here associated perhaps by way of contrast, the one being the most powerful and the other one of the least of God’s creatures. Their natures too are most dissimilar,—the silent, subtle, self-reliance of the one, couching patiently in his lair, and the clamorous outcry and appeal of the other, wandering over the land in search of food. The raven, of course, is a general name, covering the whole Crow tribe.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who provideth for the raven his food?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>, "Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and <span class="accented">God feedeth them"</span>). God's mercy is "over all his works," not only over those whereof man sees the utility; but also over beasts of prey, and birds thought to be of ill omen. Especially he cares for the young of each kind, which most need protection. When his young ones cry unto God.

What Jehovah here denies to the natural power of man is possible to the power which man has by faith, as the history of Elijah shows: this, however, does not come under consideration here. In proof of divine omnipotence and human feebleness, Elihu constantly recurs to the rain and the thunder-storm with the lightning, which is at the bidding of God. Most moderns since Schultens therefore endeavour, with great violence, to make &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; mean meteors and celestial phenomena. Eichh. (Hirz., Hahn) compares the Arabic name for the clouds, tacha&#770; (tachwa), Ew. Arab. d&#803;ih&#803;h&#803;, sunshine, with the former; the latter, whose root is &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492; (&#1505;&#1499;&#1492;), spectare, is meant to be something that is remarkable in the heavens: an atmospheric phenomenon, a meteor (Hirz.), or a phenomenon caused by light (Ew., Hahn), so that e.g., Umbr. translates: "Who hath put wisdom in the dark clouds, and given understanding to the meteor?" But the meaning which is thus extorted from the words in favour of the connection borders closely upon absurdity. Why, then, shall &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, Arab. t&#803;&#305;&#770;ych, oblinere, adipe obducere, not signify here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a>, the reins (embedded in a cushion of fat), and in fact as the seat of the predictive faculty, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>, as the seat of the innermost longing for the future; and particularly since here, after the constellations and the influences of the stars have just been spoken of, the mention of the gift of divination is not devoid of connection; and, moreover, as a glance at the next strophe shows, the connection which has been hitherto firmly kept to is already in process of being resolved?<p>If &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; signifies the reins, it is natural to interpret &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; also psychologically, and to translate the intellect (Targ. I, Syr., Arab.), or similarly (Saad., Gecat.), as Ges., Carey, Renan, Schlottm. But there is another rendering handed down which is worthy of attention, although not once mentioned by Rosenm., Hirz., Schlottm., or Hahn, according to which &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; signifies a cock, gallum. We read in b. Rosch ha-Schana, 26a: "When I came to Techm-Kn-Nishraja, R. Simeon b. Lakish relates, the bride was there called &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497; and the cock &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;, according to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-36.htm">Job 38:36</a> is to be interpreted: &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;  equals  &#1514;&#1512;&#1504;&#1490;&#1493;&#1500;." The Midrash interprets in the same way, Jalkut, 905, beginning: "R. Levi says: In Arabic the cock is called &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1488;." We compare with this, Wajikra rabba, c. 1: "&#1505;&#1493;&#1499;&#1493; is Arabic; in Arabia a prophet is called &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1488;;" whence it is to be inferred that &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;, as is assumed, describes the cock as a seer, as a prophet.<p>As to the formation of the word, it would certainly be without parallel (Ew., Olsh.) if the word had the tone on the penult., but Codd. and the best old editions have the Munach by the final syllable; Norzi, who has overlooked this, at least notes &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; with the accent on the ult. as a various reading. It is a secondary noun, Ges. 86, 5, a so-called relative noun (De Sacy, Gramm. Arabe, 768): &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;, speculator, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492;), speculatio, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>), miraculosus, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, a cognate form to the Chald. &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; (&#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;), of similar meaning. In connection with this primary signification, speculator, it is intelligible how &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; in Samaritan (vid., Lagarde on Proverbs, S. 62) can signify the eye; here, however, in a Hebrew poet, the cock, of which e.g., Gregory says: Speculator semper in altitudine stat, ut quidquid venturum sit longe prospiciat. That this signification speculator  equals  gallus<p>(Note: No Arab. word offers itself here for comparison: tuchaj, a cock, has different consonants, and if Arab. s&#780;ka&#770; in the sense of Arab. s&#780;a&#770;k, fortem esse, were to be supposed, &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; would be a synon. of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, which is likewise a name of the cock.)<p>continued...</body></html>
