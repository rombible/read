As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the dust groweth into hardness - Margin, "is poured, or, is turned into mire." The words used here relate often to metals, and to the act of pouring them out when fused, for the purpose of casting. The proper idea here is, "when the dust flows into a molten mass;" that is, when wet with rain it flows together and becomes hard. The sense is, that the rain operates on the clay as heat does on metals, and that when it is dissolved it flows together and thus becomes a solid mass. The object is to compare the effect of rain with the usual effect in casting metals.<p>And the clods cleave fast together - That is, they are run together by the rain. They form one mass of the same consistency, and then are baked hard by the sun. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. groweth, &c.&#8212;rather, pour itself into a mass by the rain, like molten metal; then translate Job 38:38, "Who is it that empties," &c., "when," &c.? The English Version, however, is tenable: "Is caked into a mass" by heat, like molten metal, before the rain falls; "Who is it that can empty the rain vessels, and bring down rain at such a time?" (Job 38:38).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse containeth a description either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of a great drought, when the earth grows hard, and close, and compact; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of the condition of the earth presently after the fall of the rain, when the earth, which in time of drought was much of it dissolved into dust, is now by the rain cemented or united together. In either of these cases it is the work of God alone to keep the clouds from pouring down more rain upon the earth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? When the dust is attenuated, and ground, as it were, into powder; and the clods cleave together, as if glued, as in a drought for want of rain: or the bottles of heaven being unstopped and poured out; or <p>"sprinkling the dust with this sprinkling,'' <p>as Mr. Broughton. Or rather, pouring on the dust with pouring; that is, pouring down rain, by unstopping the bottles of heaven. The dust, as meal, by water poured into it, cements, unites, and is compacted, and becomes earth, that may be cultivated; is clodded and cleaves together, and may be ploughed and sown. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When the dust groweth into hardness, <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> and the clods cleave fast together?</span><p>(z) For when God does not open these bottles, the earth comes to this inconvenience.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the dust groweth into hardness</span>.

When by the heat of the sun's rays the ground grows into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together, baked into a compact mass, then is the time when rain is most needed, and when the Almighty in his mercy commonly sends it. The consideration of inanimate nature here ends, with the result that its mysteries altogether transcend the human intellect, and render speculation on the still deeper mysteries of the moral world wholly vain and futile. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>31  Canst thou join the twistings of the Pleiades,<p>Or loose the bands of Orion?<p>32  Canst thou bring forth the signs of the Zodiac at the right time,<p>And canst thou guide the Bear with its children?<p>33  Knowest thou the laws of heaven,<p>Or dost thou define its influence on the earth?<p>That &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; here signifies bindings or twistings (from &#1506;&#1491;&#1503;  equals  &#1506;&#1504;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a>) is placed beyond question by the unanimous translations of the lxx (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;) and the Targ.

The Arabic name thurajja (diminutive feminine of tharwa&#770;n) probably signifies the richly-adorned, clustered constellation. But &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; signifies without doubt the clustered group,<p>(Note: The verb &#1499;&#1493;&#1501; is still in general use in the Piel (to heap up, form a heap, part. mukauwam, heaped up) and Hithpa.

If, according to Kamus, in old Jemanic k&#305;&#770;m in the sense of muka&#770;wim signifies a confederate (synon. chilt, gils), the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; would be a confederation, or a heap, assemblage (coetus) of confederates. Perhaps the &#1499;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; was regarded as a troop of camels; the Beduins at least call the star directly before the seven-starred constellation of the Pleiades the ha&#770;di, i.e., the singer riding before the procession, who cheers the camels by the sound of the hadwa (&#1495;&#1491;&#1493;&#1492;), and thereby urges them on. - Wetzst.<p>On &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, which perhaps also bear this name as a compressed group (figuratively &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;) of several stars (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;), vid., Kuhn's Zeitschr. vi. 282-285.)<p>and Beigel (in Ideler, Sternnamen, S. 147) does not translate badly: "Canst thou not arrange together the rosette of diamonds (chain would be better) of the Pleiades?"<p>As to &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, we firmly hold that it denotes Orion (according to which the Greek versions translate &#x3a9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, the Syriac gaboro, the Targ. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488; or &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488;, the Giant). Orion and the Pleiades are visible in the Syrian sky longer in the year than with us, and there they come about 17 higher above the horizon than with us. Nevertheless the figure of a giant chained to the heavens cannot be rightly shown to be Semitic, and it is questionable whether &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; is not rather, with Saad., Gecat., Abulwalid, and others, to be regarded as the Suhl, i.e., Canopus, especially as this is placed as a sluggish helper (&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, Hebr. a fool, Arab. the slothful one, ignavus) in mythical relation to the constellation of the Bear, which here is called &#1506;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a> &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, and is regarded as a bier, &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; (even in the present day this is the name in the towns and villages of Syria), which the sons and daughters forming the attendants upon the corpse of their father, slain by Ged, the Pole-star. Understood of Orion, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; (with which Arab. msk, tenere, detinere, is certainly to be compared) are the chains (Arab. masakat, compes), with which he is chained to the sky; understood of Suhl, the restraints which prevent his breaking away too soon and reaching the goal.<p>(Note: In June 1860 I witnessed a quarrel in an encampment of Mo'gil-Beduins, in which one accused the others of having rendered it possible for the enemy to carry off his camels through their negligence; and when the accused assured him they had gone forth in pursuit of the marauders soon after the raid, and only turned back at sunset, the man exclaimed: Ye came indeed to my assistance as Suhl to Ged (&#1508;&#1494;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497; &#1508;&#1494;&#1506; &#1505;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1500;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;). I asked my neighbour what the words meant, and was informed they are a proverb which is very often used, and has its origin as follows: The Ged (i.e., the Pole-star, called misma&#770;r, &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1512;, in Damascus) slew the Na&#8219;sh (&#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;), and is accordingly encompassed every night by the children of the slain Na&#8219;sh, who are determined to take vengeance on the murderer. The sons (on which account poets usually say ben&#305;&#770; instead of bena&#770;t Na&#8219;sh) go first with the corpse of their father, and the daughters follow. One of the latter is called walda&#770;ne, a lying-in woman; she has only recently given birth to a child, and carries her child in her bosom, and she is still pale from her lying-in. (The clear atmosphere of the Syrian sky admits of the child in the bosom of the walda&#770;ne being distinctly seen.) In order to give help to the Ged in this danger, the Suhl appears in the south, and struggles towards the north with a twinkling brightness, but he has risen too late; the night passes away ere he reaches his goal. Later I frequently heard this story, which is generally known among the Hauranites. - Wetzst.<p>We add the following by way of explanation. The Pleiades encircle the Pole-star as do all stars, since it stands at the axis of the sky, but they are nearer to it than to Canopus by more than half the distance. This star of the first magnitude culminates about three hours later than the Pleiades, and rises, at the highest, only ten moon's diameters above the horizon of Damascusa significant figure, therefore, of ineffectual endeavour.)<p>&#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is not distinct from &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a> (comp. &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, "Thy star of fortune," on Cilician coins), and denotes not the twenty-eight menzil (from Arab. nzl, to descend, turn in, lodge) of the moon,<p>continued...</body></html>
