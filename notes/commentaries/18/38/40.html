As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When they couch in their dens - For the purpose of springing upon their prey.<p>And abide in the covert to lie in wait? - The usual posture of the lion when he seeks his prey. He places himself in some unobserved position in a dense thicket, or crouches upon the ground so as not to be seen, and then springs suddenly upon his victim. The common method of the lion in taking his prey is to spring or throw himself upon it from the place of his ambush, with one vast bound and to inflict the mortal blow with one stroke of his paw. If he misses his aim, however, he seldom attempts another spring at the same object, but deliberately returns to the thicket in which he lay in concealment.

What Jehovah here denies to the natural power of man is possible to the power which man has by faith, as the history of Elijah shows: this, however, does not come under consideration here. In proof of divine omnipotence and human feebleness, Elihu constantly recurs to the rain and the thunder-storm with the lightning, which is at the bidding of God. Most moderns since Schultens therefore endeavour, with great violence, to make &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; mean meteors and celestial phenomena. Eichh. (Hirz., Hahn) compares the Arabic name for the clouds, tacha&#770; (tachwa), Ew. Arab. d&#803;ih&#803;h&#803;, sunshine, with the former; the latter, whose root is &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492; (&#1505;&#1499;&#1492;), spectare, is meant to be something that is remarkable in the heavens: an atmospheric phenomenon, a meteor (Hirz.), or a phenomenon caused by light (Ew., Hahn), so that e.g., Umbr. translates: "Who hath put wisdom in the dark clouds, and given understanding to the meteor?" But the meaning which is thus extorted from the words in favour of the connection borders closely upon absurdity. Why, then, shall &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, Arab. t&#803;&#305;&#770;ych, oblinere, adipe obducere, not signify here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a>, the reins (embedded in a cushion of fat), and in fact as the seat of the predictive faculty, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>, as the seat of the innermost longing for the future; and particularly since here, after the constellations and the influences of the stars have just been spoken of, the mention of the gift of divination is not devoid of connection; and, moreover, as a glance at the next strophe shows, the connection which has been hitherto firmly kept to is already in process of being resolved?<p>If &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; signifies the reins, it is natural to interpret &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; also psychologically, and to translate the intellect (Targ. I, Syr., Arab.), or similarly (Saad., Gecat.), as Ges., Carey, Renan, Schlottm. But there is another rendering handed down which is worthy of attention, although not once mentioned by Rosenm., Hirz., Schlottm., or Hahn, according to which &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; signifies a cock, gallum. We read in b. Rosch ha-Schana, 26a: "When I came to Techm-Kn-Nishraja, R. Simeon b. Lakish relates, the bride was there called &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497; and the cock &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;, according to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-36.htm">Job 38:36</a> is to be interpreted: &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;  equals  &#1514;&#1512;&#1504;&#1490;&#1493;&#1500;." The Midrash interprets in the same way, Jalkut, 905, beginning: "R. Levi says: In Arabic the cock is called &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1488;." We compare with this, Wajikra rabba, c. 1: "&#1505;&#1493;&#1499;&#1493; is Arabic; in Arabia a prophet is called &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1488;;" whence it is to be inferred that &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;, as is assumed, describes the cock as a seer, as a prophet.<p>As to the formation of the word, it would certainly be without parallel (Ew., Olsh.) if the word had the tone on the penult., but Codd. and the best old editions have the Munach by the final syllable; Norzi, who has overlooked this, at least notes &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; with the accent on the ult. as a various reading. It is a secondary noun, Ges. 86, 5, a so-called relative noun (De Sacy, Gramm. Arabe, 768): &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;, speculator, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492;), speculatio, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>), miraculosus, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, a cognate form to the Chald. &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; (&#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;), of similar meaning. In connection with this primary signification, speculator, it is intelligible how &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; in Samaritan (vid., Lagarde on Proverbs, S. 62) can signify the eye; here, however, in a Hebrew poet, the cock, of which e.g., Gregory says: Speculator semper in altitudine stat, ut quidquid venturum sit longe prospiciat. That this signification speculator  equals  gallus<p>(Note: No Arab. word offers itself here for comparison: tuchaj, a cock, has different consonants, and if Arab. s&#780;ka&#770; in the sense of Arab. s&#780;a&#770;k, fortem esse, were to be supposed, &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; would be a synon. of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, which is likewise a name of the cock.)<p>continued...</body></html>
