How strong the image! How simple the expression! We read of winged lightnings in the heathen poets; but where do they live, and act, and speak, and wait for orders with impatience as here?” See Peters and Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:25-41 Hitherto God had put questions to Job to show him his ignorance; now God shows his weakness. As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? - That is, canst thou command the clouds so that they shall send down abundant rain? Bouillier supposes that there is an allusion here to the incantations which were pretended to be practiced by the Magi, by which they claimed the power of producing rain at pleasure; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>, "Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles (the idols that they worship) that can cause rain? Art not thou he, O Lord our God?" The idea is, that it is God only who can cause rain, and that the control of the clouds from which rain descends is wholly beyond the reach of man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34.

Thy gardens, fields, and farms; canst thou, in a magisterial way, call to and demand of the clouds to let down rain in large quantities, sufficient to water them and make them fruitful? no, thou canst not: thou mayest cry and call as long as thou wilt, not a cloud will stir, nor a drop of water be let down; rain is to be had in a suppliant way, through the prayer of faith, as by Elijah, but not in a dictatorial authoritative way: the clouds and rain are only at the disposal of the Lord; ask of him, and he will give them; but they are not to be commanded, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34, 35</span>.

None but the "medicine-men" of savage tribes profess to have any such power. Elijah, indeed, "prayed, and the heaven gave rain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-18.htm">James 5:18</a>); but this was a very different thing from "commanding the clouds of heaven." His prayer was addressed to God, and God gave the rain for which he made his petition. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>28  Hath the rain a father,<p>Or who begetteth the drops of dew?<p>29  Out of whose womb cometh the ice forth,<p>And who bringeth forth the hoar-frost of heaven?<p>30  The waters become hard like stone,<p>And the face of the deep is rolled together.<p>Rain and dew have no created father, ice and hoar-frost no created mother. The parallelism in both instances shows that &#1502;&#1497; &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; asks after the one who begets, and &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493; the one who bears (vid., Hupfeld on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; is uterus, and meton.

The waters "hide themselves," by vanishing as fluid, therefore: freeze. The surface of the deep (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;, for which Zwingli has in marg. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) "takes hold of itself," or presses together (comp.

Moreover, the questions all refer not merely to the analysis of the visible origin of the phenomena, but to their final causes. </body></html>
