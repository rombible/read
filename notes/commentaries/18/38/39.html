As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? - The appeal here is to the instincts with which God has endowed animals, and to the fact that he had so made them that they would secure their own food. He asks Job whether he would undertake to do what the lion did by instinct in finding his food, and by his power and skill in seizing his prey. There was a wise adaptation of the lion for this purpose which man could neither originate nor explain.<p>Or fill the appetite of the young lions - Margin, as in Hebrew "life." The word life is used here for hunger, as the appetite is necessarily connected with the preservation of life. The meaning here is, "Wouldst thou undertake to supply his needs? It is done by laws, and in a manner which thou canst not explain. There are in the arrangement by which it is accomplished marks of wisdom which far surpass the skill of man to originate, and the instinct and power by which it is done are proof of the supremacy of the Most High." No one can study the subject of the instincts of animals, or become in the least acquainted with Natural History, without finding every where traces of the wisdom and goodness of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39.

From meteors the Lord passes to animals, beasts, and birds, wherefore some here begin the thirty ninth chapter, which only treats of such; and he begins with the lion, the strongest among beasts, and most fierce; cruel, and voracious; and asks, who hunts his prey for him? Not man, who cannot; and if he could, durst not: but the Lord does; and, according to some writers (x), he has provided a small creature, between a fox and a wolf, called a jackal; which goes before the lion, and hunts the prey for him. And could this be understood particularly of the old lion, as Cocceius and others, naturalists (y) observe, that young lions hunt for the old ones, when they are not able to go in search of prey; and when they have got it, either bring it to them, or call them to partake of it with them; <p>or fill the appetite of the young lions, whose appetite is sharp and keen, and requires a great deal to fill it, and especially to satisfy a great many of them; herds of them, as Mr. Broughton renders the word, and which signifies a company; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>.

The Arabic name thurajja (diminutive feminine of tharwa&#770;n) probably signifies the richly-adorned, clustered constellation. But &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; signifies without doubt the clustered group,<p>(Note: The verb &#1499;&#1493;&#1501; is still in general use in the Piel (to heap up, form a heap, part. mukauwam, heaped up) and Hithpa.

If, according to Kamus, in old Jemanic k&#305;&#770;m in the sense of muka&#770;wim signifies a confederate (synon. chilt, gils), the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; would be a confederation, or a heap, assemblage (coetus) of confederates. Perhaps the &#1499;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; was regarded as a troop of camels; the Beduins at least call the star directly before the seven-starred constellation of the Pleiades the ha&#770;di, i.e., the singer riding before the procession, who cheers the camels by the sound of the hadwa (&#1495;&#1491;&#1493;&#1492;), and thereby urges them on. - Wetzst.<p>On &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, which perhaps also bear this name as a compressed group (figuratively &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;) of several stars (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;), vid., Kuhn's Zeitschr. vi. 282-285.)<p>and Beigel (in Ideler, Sternnamen, S. 147) does not translate badly: "Canst thou not arrange together the rosette of diamonds (chain would be better) of the Pleiades?"<p>As to &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, we firmly hold that it denotes Orion (according to which the Greek versions translate &#x3a9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, the Syriac gaboro, the Targ. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488; or &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488;, the Giant). Orion and the Pleiades are visible in the Syrian sky longer in the year than with us, and there they come about 17 higher above the horizon than with us. Nevertheless the figure of a giant chained to the heavens cannot be rightly shown to be Semitic, and it is questionable whether &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; is not rather, with Saad., Gecat., Abulwalid, and others, to be regarded as the Suhl, i.e., Canopus, especially as this is placed as a sluggish helper (&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, Hebr. a fool, Arab. the slothful one, ignavus) in mythical relation to the constellation of the Bear, which here is called &#1506;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a> &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, and is regarded as a bier, &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; (even in the present day this is the name in the towns and villages of Syria), which the sons and daughters forming the attendants upon the corpse of their father, slain by Ged, the Pole-star. Understood of Orion, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; (with which Arab. msk, tenere, detinere, is certainly to be compared) are the chains (Arab. masakat, compes), with which he is chained to the sky; understood of Suhl, the restraints which prevent his breaking away too soon and reaching the goal.<p>(Note: In June 1860 I witnessed a quarrel in an encampment of Mo'gil-Beduins, in which one accused the others of having rendered it possible for the enemy to carry off his camels through their negligence; and when the accused assured him they had gone forth in pursuit of the marauders soon after the raid, and only turned back at sunset, the man exclaimed: Ye came indeed to my assistance as Suhl to Ged (&#1508;&#1494;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497; &#1508;&#1494;&#1506; &#1505;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1500;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;). I asked my neighbour what the words meant, and was informed they are a proverb which is very often used, and has its origin as follows: The Ged (i.e., the Pole-star, called misma&#770;r, &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1512;, in Damascus) slew the Na&#8219;sh (&#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;), and is accordingly encompassed every night by the children of the slain Na&#8219;sh, who are determined to take vengeance on the murderer. The sons (on which account poets usually say ben&#305;&#770; instead of bena&#770;t Na&#8219;sh) go first with the corpse of their father, and the daughters follow. One of the latter is called walda&#770;ne, a lying-in woman; she has only recently given birth to a child, and carries her child in her bosom, and she is still pale from her lying-in. (The clear atmosphere of the Syrian sky admits of the child in the bosom of the walda&#770;ne being distinctly seen.) In order to give help to the Ged in this danger, the Suhl appears in the south, and struggles towards the north with a twinkling brightness, but he has risen too late; the night passes away ere he reaches his goal. Later I frequently heard this story, which is generally known among the Hauranites. - Wetzst.<p>We add the following by way of explanation. The Pleiades encircle the Pole-star as do all stars, since it stands at the axis of the sky, but they are nearer to it than to Canopus by more than half the distance. This star of the first magnitude culminates about three hours later than the Pleiades, and rises, at the highest, only ten moon's diameters above the horizon of Damascusa significant figure, therefore, of ineffectual endeavour.)<p>&#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is not distinct from &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a> (comp. &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, "Thy star of fortune," on Cilician coins), and denotes not the twenty-eight menzil (from Arab. nzl, to descend, turn in, lodge) of the moon,<p>continued...</body></html>
