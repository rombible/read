And dost thou know how the souls of men are disposed of after death, and what are their various states and conditions? Or, hast thou observed and marked the several ways leading to, and introducing death? Death is a grand secret. 1st, We know not beforehand when, and how, and by what means we or others shall be brought to death; by what road we must go the way whence we shall not return; what disease or disaster will be the door to let us into the <span class="ital">house appointed for all living; man knows not his time. </span>2d, We cannot describe what death is, how the knot is untied between body and soul, nor how the spirit of a man leaves the tenement of clay, and goes: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“To be, we know not what, and live, we know not how.”</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thus Mr. Norris, who adds: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“When life’s close knot, by writ from destiny, Disease shall cut or age untie; When after some delays, some dying strife, The soul stands shivering on the ridge of life; With what a dreadful curiosity Does she launch out into the sea of vast eternity!”</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let us make it sure that the gates of heaven shall be opened to us on the other side death, and then we need not fear the opening of the gates of death to receive us, though it is a way we are to go but once. 3d, We have no correspondence at all with separate souls, nor any acquaintance with their state. It is an unknown, undiscovered region, to which they are removed. We can neither hear from them, nor send to them. While we are here, in a world of sense we speak of the world of spirits as blind men do of colours; and when we remove thither, shall be amazed to find how much we were mistaken.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:12-24 The Lord questions Job, to convince him of his ignorance, and shame him for his folly in prescribing to God. If we thus try ourselves, we shall soon be brought to own that what we know is nothing in comparison with what we know not. By the tender mercy of our God, the Day-spring from on high has visited us, to give light to those that sit in darkness, whose hearts are turned to it as clay to the seal, 2Co 4:6. God's way in the government of the world is said to be in the sea; this means, that it is hid from us. Let us make sure that the gates of heaven shall be opened to us on the other side of death, and then we need not fear the opening of the gates of death. It is presumptuous for us, who perceive not the breadth of the earth, to dive into the depth of God's counsels. We should neither in the brightest noon count upon perpetual day, nor in the darkest midnight despair of the return of the morning; and this applies to our inward as well as to our outward condition. What folly it is to strive against God! How much is it our interest to seek peace with him, and to keep in his love!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have the gates of death been opened unto thee - That is, the gates of the world where death reigns; or the gates that lead to the abodes of the dead. The allusion here is to "Sheol," or "Hades," the dark abodes of the dead. This was supposed to be beneath the ground, and was entered by the grave, and was inclosed by gates and bars; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>. The transition from the reference to the bottom of the sea to the regions of the dead was natural, and the mind is carried forward to a subject further beyond the ken of mortals than even the unfathomable depths of the ocean. The idea is, that God saw all that occurred in that dark world beneath us, where the dead were congregated, and that his vast superiority to man was evinced by his being able thus to penetrate into, and survey those hidden regions. It is common in the Classical writers to represent those regions as entered by gates. Thus, Lucretius, i.1105,<p> - Haec rebus erit para janua letl,<p>Hae se turba foras dabit omnis materai.<p> - "The doors of death are ope,<p>And the vast whole unbounded ruin whelms."<p>Good.<p>So Virgil, Aeneid ii.661,<p> - Pater isti janua leto,<p>"The door of death stands open."<p>Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? - The doors which lead down to the gloomy realms where death spreads its dismal shades. This expression is more emphatic than the former, for the word &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;  tsalma&#770;veth "shadow of death," is more intensive in its meaning than the word &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;  ma&#770;veth, "death." There is the superadded idea of a deep and dismal shadow; of profound and gloomy darkness; see the word explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-5.htm">Job 3:5</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>. Man was unable to penetrate those gloomy abodes and to reveal what was there; but God saw all with the clearness of noon-day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. seen&#8212;The second clause heightens the thought in the first. Man during life does not even "see" the gates of the realm of the dead ("death," Job 10:21); much less are they "opened" to him. But those are "naked before God" (Job 26:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Hast thou seen, or dost thou perfectly know, the place and state of the dead, the depths and bowels of that earth in which the generality of dead men are buried, or the several ways and methods of death, or the various states and conditions of men after death?

Meaning not by which death has entered into the world, and which have been the causes and occasion of it; as the sin of man, the appointment of God, and various providences, calamities and diseases; but by which men enter into the state of the dead. Men know not experimentally what death is, nor in what way they shall go out of the world, nor at what time, nor in what place; they know not what the state of the dead is, there is no correspondence between them and the living; they do not know either what they enjoy or endure, or who precisely and with certainty are in the separate abodes of bliss or misery; the gates of these dark and invisible regions to us have never been thrown open, for mortals to look into them; <p>or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? the same thing in other words; the Targum and Jarchi interpret this of hell. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">have the gates of death</span>] Or, <span class="bld">were</span> the gates?

The question does not, however, refer to the &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;, in which the waters of the sky and the waters of the earth were as yet not separated, but, passing over this intermediate condition of the forming earth, to the sea, the waters of which God shut up as by means of a door and bolt, when, first enshrouded in thick mist (which has remained from that time one of its natural peculiarities), and again and again manifesting its individuality, it broke forth (&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495; of the foetus, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10</a>) from the bowels of the, as yet, chaotic earth. That the sea, in spite of the flatness of its banks, does not flow over the land, is a work of omnipotence which broke over it, i.e., restraining it, a fixed bound (&#1495;&#1511; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-10.htm">Job 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-29.htm">Proverbs 8:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>,  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-9.htm">Psalm 104:9</a>), viz., the steep and rugged walls of the basin of the sea, and which thereby established a firm barrier behind which it should be kept.
