As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? - Margin, "the twelve signs;" that is, the twelve signs of the zodiac. There has been much diversity of opinion about the meaning of this word. It occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures, and of course it is not easy to determine its signification. The Septuagint retains the word &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b8;  maxsuro&#772;th, without attempting to translate it. Jerome renders it, "Luciferum - Lucifer," the morning-star. The Chaldee, &#1502;&#1494;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488; &#1513;&#1496;&#1512;&#1497; - the constellations of the planets. Coverdale, "the morning-star;" and so Luther renders it. Rosenmuller, "signa celestia" - the celestial signs, and so Herder, Umbreit, Gesenius, and Noyes, "the zodiac." Gesenius regards the word &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;  mazza&#770;ra&#770;h, as the same as &#1502;&#1494;&#1500;&#1492;  mazza&#770;la&#770;h, properly "lodgings, inns;" and hence, the "lodgings" of the sun, or the places or "houses" in which he appears in the heavens, and thus as meaning the signs in the zodiac. Most of the Hebrew interpreters adopt this view, but it rests on no certain foundation, and as we are not certain as to the meaning of the word, the only safe way is to retain the original, as is done in our common version. I do not see how it is possible to determine its meaning with certainty, and probably it is to be regarded as a name given to some constellation or cluster of stars supposed to exert an influence over the seasons, or connected with some change in the seasons, which we cannot now accurately understand.<p>Or canst thou guide Arcturus? - On the constellation "Arcturus" (&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;  &#8219;ayish), see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>. The word rendered "guide" in the text, is in the margin "guide them." The Hebrew is, "and &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;  &#8219;ayish upon (or near - &#1506;&#1500;  &#8219;al) her sons, canst thou lead them?" Herder and Umbreit render it, "And lead forth the Bear with her young," or her children. The reference is to the constellation Arcturus, or Ursa Major, in the northern sky. The "sons" referred to are the stars that accompany it, probably the stars that are now called the" tail of the bear." "Umbreit." Another interpretation is suggested by Herder, which is that this constellation is represented as a nightly wanderer - a mother, who is seeking her lost children, the stars that are no longer visible, and that thus revolves around the heavens. But the probable reference is to the constellation conducted round and round the pole as by some unseen hand, like a mother with her children, and the question is, whether Job had skill and power to do this? God appeals to it as a manifestation of his majesty and power, and as far above the skill of man. Who ever looked upon that beautiful constellation and marked its regular revolutions, without feeling that its position and movements were such as God only could produce? <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>By number - As if he had numbered, or named them; as a military commander would call forth his armies in their proper order, and have them so numbered and enrolled in the various divisions, that he can command them with ease.<p>He calleth them all by names - This idea is also taken from a military leader, who would know the names of the individuals that composed his army. In smaller divisions of an army, this could of course be done; but the idea is, that God is intimately acquainted with all the hosts of stars; that though their numbers appear to us so great, yet he is acquainted with each one individually, and has that knowledge of it which we have of a person or object which we recognize by a name. It is said of Cyrus, that he was acquainted by name with every individual that composed his vast army. The practice of giving names to the stars of heaven was early, and is known to have been originated by the Chaldeans. Intimations of this custom we have not unfrequently in the Scriptures, as far back as the time of Job:<p>Which maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Pleiades,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.

The connexion as well as the parallelism of the next clause suggests that some single star or constellation is meant. Others would render <span class="ital">the bright stars</span>; the planets, perhaps, or some of them being referred to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Arcturus with his sons</span>] Or, <span class="ital">the bear with her young</span>. The reference is supposed to be to the constellation of the Great Bear. Her “young” are the stars that project from the square; or, taking the popular conception of the constellation as a “plough,” they are the bright stars that form the “beam.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?</span> The context implies that "Mazzaroth' is a constellation on a par with the Pleiades, Orion, and the Bear (Kimah, <span class="accented">Kesil</span> and '<span class="accented">Aish</span>). This makes it impossible to accept the meaning, so generally assigned, of "the twelve signs of the Zodiac." Again, the plural form is fatal to the conjecture that "Mazzaroth" designates a single star or planet, as Jupiter, Venus, or Sirius (Cook). The word is derived probably from the root zahar, "to shine," "to be bright," and should designate some especially brilliant cluster of stars Whether it is to be regarded as a variant of <span class="accented">Mazzaloth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>) is uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</span> (On the identity of '<span class="accented">Ash</span> or '<span class="accented">Aish</span> with the Great Bear, see the comment on Job 9:9.)
