As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of.

"It is well known, that, in different regions of the earth, the appearance of certain constellations before sunrise or after sunset, marks the distinction of seasons, and regulates the labors of the farmer." Wemyss. It is also known that the appearance of certain constellations - as Orion - was regarded by mariners as denoting a stormy and tempestuous season of the year. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7-9</a>, notes; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31-33</a>, notes. This seems to be the knowledge of the constellations referred to here, and there is no certain evidence that the observation of the heavens in the time of Job had gone beyond this.<p>A somewhat curious use has been made of the reference to the stars in the book of Job, by an attempt to determine the time when he lived. Supposing the principal stars here mentioned to be those of Taurus and Scorpio, and that these were the cardinal constellations of spring and autumn in the time of Job, and calculating their positions by the precession of the equinoxes, the time referred to in the book of Job was found to be 818 years after the deluge, or 184 years before the birth of Abraham. "This calculation, made by Dr. Brinkley of Dublin, and adopted by Dr. Hales, had been made also in 1765 by M. Ducontant in Paris, with a result differing only in being forty-two years less." The coincidence is remarkable, but the proof that the constellations referred to are Taurus and Scorpio, is too uncertain to give much weight to the argument.<p>II.Cosmology<p>The intimations about the structure, the size, and the support of the earth, are also very obscure, and the views entertained would seem to have been very confused. Language is used, doubtless, such as would express the popular belief, and it resembles that which is commonly employed in the Scriptures. The common representation is, that the heavens are stretched out as a curtain or tent, or sometimes as a solid concave sphere in which the heavenly bodies are fixed (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>), and that the earth is an immense plain, surrounded by water, which reached the concave heavens in which the stars were fixed. Occasionally, the earth is represented as supported by pillars, or as resting on a solid foundation; and once we meet with an intimation that it is globular, and suspended in space.<p>In the following passages the earth and the sky are represented as supported by pillars:<p>He shaketh the earth out of her place,<p>And the pillars thereof tremble. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-6.htm">Job 9:6</a><p>The pillars of heaven tremble,<p>And are astonished at his rebuke. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-11.htm">Job 31:11</a>.<p>In the latter passage the reference is to mountains, which seem to uphold the sky as pillars, in accordance with the common and popular representation among the ancients. Thus Mount Atlas, in Mauritania, was represented as a pillar on which heaven was suspended:<p>"Atlas' broad shoulders prop th' incumbent skies,<p>Around his cloud-girt head the stars arise,"<p>In the following passage the earth is represented as suspended on nothing, and there would seem to be a slight evidence that the true doctrine about the form of the earth was then known:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. sweet influences&#8212;the joy diffused by spring, the time when the Pleiades appear. The Eastern poets, Hafiz, Sadi, &c., describe them as "brilliant rosettes." Gesenius translates: "bands" or "knot," which answers better the parallelism. But English Version agrees better with the Hebrew. The seven stars are closely "bound" together (see on [550]Job 9:9). "Canst thou bind or loose the tie?" "Canst thou loose the bonds by which the constellation Orion (represented in the East as an impious giant chained to the sky) is held fast?" (See on [551]Job 9:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Bind, </span> i.e. restrain or hinder them.

Of which See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>; and this constellation of the seven stars which is meant, rising in the spring, the pleasantnesses of the season, as the word may be rendered, may be intended here; which cannot be restrained or hindered from taking place in the proper course of the year; which is beautifully described in Sol 2:12; and may in a spiritual sense relate to the effects of powerful and efficacious grace, the influences of which are irresistible, and cause a springtime in the souls of men, where it was before winter, a state of darkness, deadness, coldness, hardness, and unfruitfulness, but now the reverse. Some versions read, "the bands of the Pleiades" (l), as if the sense was, canst thou gather and bind, or cluster together, such a constellation as the seven stars be, as I have done? thou canst not; and so not stop their rising or hinder their influences, according to the other versions: <p>or loose the bands of Orion? of which See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>. This constellation appears in the winter, and brings with it stormy winds, rain, snow, and frost, which latter binds up the earth, that seeds and roots in it cannot spring up; and binds the hands of men from working, by benumbing them, or rendering their materials or utensils useless; for which reasons bands are ascribed to Orion, and are such strong ones that it is not in the power of men to loose: the seasons are not to be altered by men; and, Job might be taught by this that it was not in his power to make any change in the dispensations of Providence; to turn the winter of adversity into the spring of prosperity; and therefore it was best silently to submit to the sovereignty of God, and wait his time for a change of circumstances. <p>(l)  , Sept.

The questions addressed to Job, throughout the chapter, mean in general, Is it he that effects what is observed to be done? not, Can he undo what is done, or do what is not done? Hence the questions here imply that the Pleiades <span class="ital">are</span> bound and that Orion is loosed, and Job is asked whether it be <span class="ital">he</span> that binds in the one case and looses in the other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the sweet influences</span>] The idea suggested by “influences” is that man’s life on the earth is ruled by the stars, as Shakespeare calls the moon<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the moist star,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire hangs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is, however, no trace of this idea in the original word. Those who retain this translation suppose the reference to be to the genial influence of spring, of which this cluster of stars, when appearing before the sun in the east, was a joyful herald. Such a reference is too remote; neither does it allow any just meaning to “bind.” Besides, the exegetical tradition is that the word rendered “sweet influences “has the same sense as “bands” in the second clause (so Sept. δεσμόν), as the parallelism requires. The verse rather means,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dost thou bind the bands of the Pleiades,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or loose the cords of Orion?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not certain that these are the stars meant, and the allusions are obscure. As “loosing the cords” or bands of Orion cannot mean dissolving the constellation and separating its stars from one another, so, if the parallelism is exact, “binding the bands” of the Pleiades ought not to refer to the fact that the stars of this constellation always appear as a group in the same form, although this is the idea which most writers consider to be expressed. The word in the second clause, being from a root always meaning <span class="ital">to draw</span> (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm" title="Can you draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which you let down?">Job 41:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-18.htm" title="Woe to them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:">Isaiah 5:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-4.htm" title="I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat to them.">Hosea 11:4</a>), ought to have some such sense as <span class="ital">cords</span>,—that by which anything is drawn, rather than that by which it is bound. The reference is probably to the motion of the constellation in the heavens. An Arabic poet, bewailing the slowness of the hours of a night of sorrow, says that, in their immobility and tardiness to turn towards their setting-place, “its stars seem bound by cords to a rock.” The same poet, however, compares the Pleiades, including perhaps Orion under the name, when it appears upon the horizon, to a girdle studded with jewels; and some have supposed that the sense in the present passage is similar, rendering, <span class="ital">Dost thou bind into a band</span> (or fillet) <span class="ital">the Pleiades</span>? This is an improbable conceit. So far as the mere language is concerned, the first clause most naturally refers to some star or constellation which appears bound to one place, whether it be that it stands always high in the heavens or is unable to rise much above the horizon; and the second clause to some star or group whose motion in the heavens is free, whether it be that it is able to rise high or that it sets and disappears.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">31–38</span>.

Whether the "sweet influences" of the constellation are here spoken of is very doubtful. Schultens and Professor Lee support the rendering; but most critics prefer to translate the word employed (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) by "chains" or "fastenings" (Rashi, Kimchi, Rosenmuller, Dillmann, Canon Cook). If we adopt this view, we must suppose the invisible links which unite the stars into a constellation to be intended. Job is asked whether he can draw the links nearer  together, and bind the stars closer to one another. <span class="cmt_word">Or loose the bands of Orion?</span> The identity of <span class="accented">Kesil</span> with Orion is generally allowed.

Wetzstein has in his possession a writing of Muhammed el-Chatb el-Bosrwi, in which he describes a fearful fall of snow in Hauran, by which, in February 1860, innumerable herds of sheep, goats, and camels, and also many human beings perished.<p>(Note: Since the Hauranites say of snow as of fire: jahrik, it burns (brlant in French is also used of extreme cold), <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a> might also be understood of a fall of snow; but the tenor of the words there requires it to be understood of actual fire.)<p>continued...</body></html>
