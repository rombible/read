It is not easy to decide which is most in accordance with the context, for the context also is somewhat uncertain, according as we interpret the solid mass of thick mud or of hard, dry soil. The survey of physical phenomena ends with this verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/38.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/38-37.htm" title="Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,...">Job 38:37-38</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who can number the clouds in wisdom? — </span>Who can wisely search, and exactly find out, the number of the clouds? which are indeed numberless, and filled with water as the next clause implies. <span class="ital">Or who can stay the bottles of heaven? — </span>Can prevent the rain from being poured upon the earth out of the clouds, in which it is kept as in bottles; <span class="ital">when the dust groweth into hardness — </span>When the earth grows very hard, in the time of a great drought; <span class="ital">and the clods cleave fast together — </span>Become close and compact.

As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who can number the clouds? - The word here rendered "clouds" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;  shachaqiym) is applied to the clouds as made up of "small particles" - as if they were composed of fine dust, and hence, the word number is applied to them, not as meaning that the clouds themselves were innumerable, but that no one could estimate the number of particles which enter into their formation.<p>In wisdom - By his wisdom. Who has sufficient intelligence to do it?<p>Or who can stay the bottles of heaven? - Margin, as in Hebrew "cause to lie down." The clouds are here compared with bottles, as if they held the water in the same manner; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>. The word rendered "stay" in the text, and in the margin "cause to lie down," is rendered by Umbreit, "pour out," from an Arabic signification of the word. Gesenius supposes that the meaning to "pour out" is derived from the idea of "causing to lie down," from the fact that a bottle or vessel was made to lie down or was inclined to one side when its contents were poured out. This explanation seems probable, though there is no other place in the Hebrew where the word is used in this signification. The sense of pouring out agrees well with the connection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37.

Aben Ezra interprets it, who can make them as sapphire? in which he is followed by Mr. Broughton and others (u); the sapphire is a precious stone, very clear and lucid, of a sky colour. And then the sense is, who can make a clear and serene sky, when it is cloudy? None but the Lord; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11</a>; <p>or who can stay the bottles of heaven? or "barrels", as Mr. Broughton; the clouds in which the rain is bottled or barrelled up; and when it is the pleasure of God to pour them out, who can stay, stop, or restrain them? or who can "cause them to lie down" (w)? that is, on the earth; to descend or "distil" on it, as the same translator. Who can do this, when it is the will of God to withhold them? To stop or unstop, those bottles, to restrain rain, or pour it forth, is entirely at his dispose, and not man's; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-34.htm">Job 38:34</a>. <p>(t) "enarrabit", V.

The Arabic name thurajja (diminutive feminine of tharwa&#770;n) probably signifies the richly-adorned, clustered constellation. But &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; signifies without doubt the clustered group,<p>(Note: The verb &#1499;&#1493;&#1501; is still in general use in the Piel (to heap up, form a heap, part. mukauwam, heaped up) and Hithpa.

If, according to Kamus, in old Jemanic k&#305;&#770;m in the sense of muka&#770;wim signifies a confederate (synon. chilt, gils), the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; would be a confederation, or a heap, assemblage (coetus) of confederates. Perhaps the &#1499;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; was regarded as a troop of camels; the Beduins at least call the star directly before the seven-starred constellation of the Pleiades the ha&#770;di, i.e., the singer riding before the procession, who cheers the camels by the sound of the hadwa (&#1495;&#1491;&#1493;&#1492;), and thereby urges them on. - Wetzst.<p>On &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, which perhaps also bear this name as a compressed group (figuratively &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;) of several stars (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;), vid., Kuhn's Zeitschr. vi. 282-285.)<p>and Beigel (in Ideler, Sternnamen, S. 147) does not translate badly: "Canst thou not arrange together the rosette of diamonds (chain would be better) of the Pleiades?"<p>As to &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, we firmly hold that it denotes Orion (according to which the Greek versions translate &#x3a9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, the Syriac gaboro, the Targ. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488; or &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488;, the Giant). Orion and the Pleiades are visible in the Syrian sky longer in the year than with us, and there they come about 17 higher above the horizon than with us. Nevertheless the figure of a giant chained to the heavens cannot be rightly shown to be Semitic, and it is questionable whether &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; is not rather, with Saad., Gecat., Abulwalid, and others, to be regarded as the Suhl, i.e., Canopus, especially as this is placed as a sluggish helper (&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, Hebr. a fool, Arab. the slothful one, ignavus) in mythical relation to the constellation of the Bear, which here is called &#1506;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a> &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, and is regarded as a bier, &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; (even in the present day this is the name in the towns and villages of Syria), which the sons and daughters forming the attendants upon the corpse of their father, slain by Ged, the Pole-star. Understood of Orion, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; (with which Arab. msk, tenere, detinere, is certainly to be compared) are the chains (Arab. masakat, compes), with which he is chained to the sky; understood of Suhl, the restraints which prevent his breaking away too soon and reaching the goal.<p>(Note: In June 1860 I witnessed a quarrel in an encampment of Mo'gil-Beduins, in which one accused the others of having rendered it possible for the enemy to carry off his camels through their negligence; and when the accused assured him they had gone forth in pursuit of the marauders soon after the raid, and only turned back at sunset, the man exclaimed: Ye came indeed to my assistance as Suhl to Ged (&#1508;&#1494;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497; &#1508;&#1494;&#1506; &#1505;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1500;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;). I asked my neighbour what the words meant, and was informed they are a proverb which is very often used, and has its origin as follows: The Ged (i.e., the Pole-star, called misma&#770;r, &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1512;, in Damascus) slew the Na&#8219;sh (&#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;), and is accordingly encompassed every night by the children of the slain Na&#8219;sh, who are determined to take vengeance on the murderer. The sons (on which account poets usually say ben&#305;&#770; instead of bena&#770;t Na&#8219;sh) go first with the corpse of their father, and the daughters follow. One of the latter is called walda&#770;ne, a lying-in woman; she has only recently given birth to a child, and carries her child in her bosom, and she is still pale from her lying-in. (The clear atmosphere of the Syrian sky admits of the child in the bosom of the walda&#770;ne being distinctly seen.) In order to give help to the Ged in this danger, the Suhl appears in the south, and struggles towards the north with a twinkling brightness, but he has risen too late; the night passes away ere he reaches his goal. Later I frequently heard this story, which is generally known among the Hauranites. - Wetzst.<p>We add the following by way of explanation. The Pleiades encircle the Pole-star as do all stars, since it stands at the axis of the sky, but they are nearer to it than to Canopus by more than half the distance. This star of the first magnitude culminates about three hours later than the Pleiades, and rises, at the highest, only ten moon's diameters above the horizon of Damascusa significant figure, therefore, of ineffectual endeavour.)<p>&#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is not distinct from &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a> (comp. &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, "Thy star of fortune," on Cilician coins), and denotes not the twenty-eight menzil (from Arab. nzl, to descend, turn in, lodge) of the moon,<p>continued...</body></html>
