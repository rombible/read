Either to the present clap of thunder then heard; or rather to what Elihu had last said concerning clouds of rain coming for correction or mercy; and improve it and apply it to his own case, and consider whether the afflictions he was under were for the reproof and correction of him for sin, or in mercy and love to his soul and for his good, as both might be the case; or to what he had further to say to him, which was but little more, and he should conclude; <p>stand still; stand up, in order to hear better, and in reverence of what might be said; and with silence, that it might be the better received and understood: <p>and consider the wondrous works of God; not prodigies and extraordinary things, which are out of the common course of nature, such as the wonders in Egypt, at the Red sea, in the wilderness, and in the land of Canaan, but common things; such as come more or less under daily observation, for of such only he had been speaking, and continued to speak; such as winds, clouds, thunder, lightning, hail, rain, and snow; these he would have him consider and reflect upon, that though they were so common and obvious to view, yet there were some things in them marvellous and beyond the full comprehension of men; and therefore much more must be the works of Providence, and the hidden causes and reasons of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14–23</span>.

If not, shouldest thou not own, as we do, that "we cannot find him out" (ver. 23), cannot reach to the depths of his nature, and therefore are unfit to pronounce judgment on his doings? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  6  For He saith to the snow: Fall towards the earth,<p>And to the rain-shower<p>And the showers of His mighty rain.<p>  7  He putteth a seal on the hand of every man,<p>That all men may come to a knowledge of His creative work.<p>  8  The wild beast creepeth into a hiding-place,<p>And in its resting-place it remaineth.<p>  9  Out of the remote part cometh the whirlwind,<p>And cold from the cloud-sweepers.<p>10  From the breath of God cometh ice,<p>And the breadth of the waters is straitened.<p>Like &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-36.htm">Job 34:36</a>, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>, &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a> (is falsely translated "be earthwards" by lxx, Targ., and Syr.), also belongs to the most striking Arabisms of the Elihu section: it signifies delabere (Jer. ut descendat), a signification which the Arab. hawa&#770; does not gain from the radical signification placed first in Gesenius-Dietrich's Handwrterbuch, to breathe, blow, but from the radical signification, to gape, yawn, by means of the development of the meaning which also decides in favour of the primary notion of the Hebr. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, according to which, what was said on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-2.htm">Job 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-13.htm">Job 30:13</a> is to be corrected.<p>(Note: Arab. hawa&#770; is originally &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to gape, yawn, hiare, e.g., hawat et-ta&#8219;natu, the stab gapes (imperf. tahw&#305;&#770;, inf. huw&#305;&#770;jun), "when it opens its mouth" - the Turkish Kamus adds, to complete the picture: like a tulip. Thence next ha&#770;wijatun, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  equals  hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, huwa&#770;atun, mahwa&#770;tun, a cleft, yawning deep, chasm, abyss, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, vorago; haw&#305;&#770;jatun and hauha&#770;tun (a reduplicated form), especially a very deep pit or well. But these same words, ha&#770;wijatun, hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, mahwa&#770;tun, also signify, like the usual Arab. hawa'a&#770;'un, the &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; between heaven and earth, i.e., the wide, empty space, the same as 'gauwun. The wider significations, or rather applications and references of hawa&#770;: air set in motion, a current of air, wind, weather, are all secondary, and related to that primary signification as sama&#770;, rain-clouds, rain, grass produced by the rain, to the prim. signification height, heaven, vid., Mehren, Rhetorik d. Araber, S. 107, Z. 14ff. This hawa&#770;, however, also signifies in general: a broad, empty space, and by transferring the notion of "empty" to mind and heart, as the reduplicated forms hu&#770;hatun and hauha&#770;tun: devoid of understanding and devoid of courage, e.g., Koran xiv. 44: wa-af'i-datuhum hawa&#770;un, where Bedhw first explains hawa&#770; directly by chala&#770;, emptiness, empty space, i.e., as he adds, cha&#770;lijetun &#8219;an el-fahm, as one says of one without mind and courage qalbuhu hawa&#770;un. Thence also hauwun, emptiness, a hole, i.e., in a wall or roof, a dormar-window (kauwe, ku&#770;we), but also with the genit. of a person or thing: their hole, i.e., the space left empty by them, the side not taken up by them, e.g., qa&#8219;ada fi hauwihi, he set himself beside him. From the signification to be empty then comes (1) hawat el-mar'atu, i.e., vacua fuit mulier  equals  orba oiberis, as &#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, vidua, properly empty, French vide; (2) hawa&#770; er-ragulu, i.e., vacuus, inanis factus est vir  equals  exanimatus (comp. Arab. frg, he became empty, euphemistic for he died).<p>From this variously applied primary signification is developed the generally known and usual Arab. hawa&#770;, loose and free, without being held or holding to anything one's self, to pass away, fly, swing, etc., libere ferri, labi, in general in every direction, as the wind, or what is driven hither and thither by the wind, especially however from above downwards, labi, delabi, cadere, deorsum ruere. From this point, like many similar, the word first passes into the signification of sound (as certainly also &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, &#1513;&#1488;): as anything falling has a full noise, and so on, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, rumorem, fragorem edere (fragor from frangi), hence hawat udhnuhu jaw&#305;&#770;jan of a singing in the ears.<p>continued...</body></html>
