We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of the south - Margin, "chamber." Jerome, "ab interioribus - from the interior," or "inner places." Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  ek taueio&#772;n - "from their chambers issue sorrows" - &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  othunas. The Hebrew word used here (&#1495;&#1491;&#1512;  cheder) denotes properly "an apartment," or "chamber," especially an inner apartment, or a chamber in the interior of a house or tent: <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-9.htm">Judges 16:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-12.htm">Judges 16:12</a>. Hence, it means a bed-chamber, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-7.htm">2 Samuel 4:7</a>, or a female apartment or harem, Sol 1:4; Sol 3:4. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>, it is connected with the "south" - "the chambers of the south" (see the notes at that place), and means some remote, hidden regions in that quarter. There can be little doubt that the word "south "is here also to be understood, as it stands in contrast with a word which properly denotes the north. Still there may have been reference to a supposed opinion that whirlwinds had their origin in deep, hollow caves, and that they were owing to the winds which were supposed to be pent up there, and which raged tumultuously until they broke open the doors of their prison, and then poured forth with violence over the earth; compare the description of the storm in Virgil, as quoted above in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-5.htm">Job 37:5</a>. There are frequent allusions in the Scriptures to the fact that whirlwinds come from the South; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>. Savary says of the south wind, which blows in Egypt from February to May, that it fills the atmosphere with a fine dust, rendering breathing difficult, and that it is filled with an injurious vapor. Sometimes it appears in the form of a furious whirlwind, which advances with great rapidity, and which is highly dangerous to those who traverse the desert. It drives before it clouds of burning sand; the horizon appears covered with a thick veil, and the sun appears red as blood. Occasionally whole caravans are buried by it in the sand. It is possible that there may be reference to such a whirlwind in the passage before us; compare Burder, in Rosenmuller's Alte u. neue Morgenland. No. 765.<p>The whirlwind - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>, note.<p>And cold out of the north - Margin, "scattering" winds. The Hebrew word used here (&#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  meza&#770;riym) means literally, "the scattering," and is hence used for the north winds, says Gesenius which scatter the clouds, and bring severe cold. Umbreit thinks the word is used to denote the north, because we seem to see the north winds strewed on the clouds. Probably the reference is to the north wind as scattering the snow or hail on the ground. Heated winds come from the south; but those which scatter the snow, and are the source of cold, come from the north. In all places north of the equator it is true that the winds from the northern quarter are the source of cold. The idea of Elihu is, that all these things are under the control of God, and that these various arrangements for heat and cold are striking proofs of his greatness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. south&#8212;literally, "chambers"; connected with the south (Job 9:9). The whirlwinds are poetically regarded as pent up by God in His southern chambers, whence He sends them forth (so Job 38:22; Ps 135:7). As to the southern whirlwinds (see Isa 21:1; Zec 9:14), they drive before them burning sands; chiefly from February to May.<p>the north&#8212;literally, "scattering"; the north wind scatters the clouds.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Out of the south, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">out of the inner chamber</span>; as the southern part of the world is called, because in a great part it was and is hid and unknown to those who live in the northern hemisphere, in which Job’s habitation lay. <span class="ital">Or, out of the chambers of the south</span>, as it is more largely expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm" title="Which makes Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.">Job 9:9</a></span>; for this is opposed to the north in the following clause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The whirlwind; </span> violent and stormy winds which in those parts most frequently came-out of the south, whence they are called <span class="ital">whirlwinds of the south</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-14.htm" title="And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.">Zechariah 9:14</a></span>.
