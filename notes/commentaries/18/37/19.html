The best of men are much in the dark concerning the glorious perfections of the Divine nature and the Divine government. Those who, through grace, know much of God, know nothing, in comparison with what is to be known, and of what will be known, when that which is perfect is come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Teach us what we shall say unto him - This seems to be addressed to Job. It is the language of Elihu, implying that he was overawed with a sense of the majesty and glory of such a God. He knew not in what manner, or with what words to approach such a Being, and he asks Job to inform him, if he knew.<p>We cannot order our speech by reason of darkness - Job had repeatedly professed a desire to bring his cause directly before God, and to argue it in his presence. He felt assured that if he could do that, he should be able so to present it as to obtain a decision in his favor; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18-22</a>, notes. Elihu now designs, indirectly, to censure that confidence. He says that he and his friends were so overawed by the majesty of God, and felt themselves so ignorant and so ill qualified to judge of him and his works, that they would not know what to say. They were in darkness. They could not understand even the works of his hands which were directly before them, and the most common operations of nature were inscrutable to them. How then could they presume to arraign God? How could they manage a cause before him with any hope of success? It is scarcely necessary to say, that the state of mind referred to here by Elihu is that which should be cultivated, and that the feelings which he expresses are those with which we should approach the Creator. We need someone to teach us. We are surrounded by mysteries which we cannot comprehend, and we should, therefore, approach our Maker with profound reverence and submission <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

To this wonder working God, of whose common works of nature we know so little; how we should reason with him about his works of Providence, when we know so little of these: <p>for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness; by reason of darkness in themselves, which is in all men naturally, and even in the saints in this state of imperfection; and by reason of the clouds and darkness which are about the Lord himself, who is incomprehensible in his nature and perfections; and by reason of the darkness cast about his providential dealings with men, so that they are unsearchable and past finding out; and the best of men are at a loss how to order their speech, or discourse with God concerning these things. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Teach us what we shall say unto him; <i>for</i> we cannot order <i>our speech</i> by reason of <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> darkness.</span><p>(p) That is, our ignorance: signifying that Job was so presumptuous, that he would control the works of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>.

The old versions connect &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; partly with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, electus (lxx, Syr., Theod.) or frumentum (Symm., Jer.), partly with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512; in the signification puritas, serenitas (Targ.); but &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; is, as Schultens has already perceived, the Hebr.-Arabic &#1512;&#1497;, Arab. r&#305;&#770;yun, r&#305;&#770;j-un (from &#1512;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  riwj), abundant irrigation, with &#1489;&#1468;; and &#1497;&#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495; does not signify, according to the Arab. atraha, "to hurl down," so that what is spoken of would be the bursting of the clouds (Stick.), <p>(Note: This "atraha" is, moreover, a pure invention of our ordinary Arabic lexicons instead of ittaraha (VIII form): (1) to throw one's self, (2) to throw anything from one's self, with an acc. of the thing. - Fl.)<p>but, according to &#1496;&#1512;&#1495;, a burden (comp. Arab. taraha ala, to load), "to burden;" with fluidity (Ew., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm.), better: fulness of water, He burdens the clouds (comp. rawij-un as a designation of cloud as the place of rain). &#1506;&#1504;&#1503; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;, His cloud of light, is that that is charged with lightning, and &#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509; has here its Hebr.-Arab. radical signification effundere, diffundere, with a preponderance of the idea not of scattering, but of spreading out wide (Arab. faid, abundance). &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-12.htm">Job 37:12</a>, refers to the cloud pregnant with lightning; this turns round about (&#1502;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, adv. as &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;, round about, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>) seeking a place, where it shall unburden itself by virtue of His (God's) direction or disposing (&#1514;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, a word belonging to the book of Proverbs; lxx, Cod. Vat. and Alex., untranslated: &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;, Cod. Sinait. still more monstrous), in order that they (the clouds full of lightning) may accomplish everything that He commands them over the surface of the earth; &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a>, and the combination &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-31.htm">Proverbs 8:31</a>, comp. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1493;&#1514;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>. The reference of the pronominal suff. to men is as inadmissible here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-13.htm">Job 37:13</a> two &#1488;&#1501; have certainly, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-29.htm">Job 34:29</a>, two &#1493;, the correlative signification sive ... sive (Arab. in ... wa-in), in a third, as appears, a conditional, but which? According to Ew., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm., and others, the middle one: if it (the rod) belongs to His land, i.e., if it has deserved it. But even the possessive suff. of &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493; shows that the &#1500; is to be taken as dat. commodi: be it for a rod, be it for the good of His land; which is then followed by a conditional verbal clause: in case He mercifully causes it (the storm) to come, i.e., causes this His land to be overtaken by it (&#1492;&#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; here with the acc., the thing coming, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-11.htm">Job 34:11</a> of the thing to be overtaken). The accentuation, indeed, appears to assume a threefold sive: whether He causeth it to discharge itself upon man for punishment, man for mercy, or His earth for good with reference to man. Then Elihu would think of the uninhabited steppe in connection with &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;. Since a conditional &#1488;&#1501; by the side of two correlatives is hazardous, we decide finally with the lxx, Targ., and all the old versions, in favour of the same rendering of the threefold &#1488;&#1501;, especially since it corresponds to the circumstances of the case. </body></html>
