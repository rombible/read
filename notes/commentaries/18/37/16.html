The difficulty to be explained was, that the clouds, so full of water, did not fail to the earth, but remained suspended in the atmosphere. They were poised and moved about by some unseen hand. Elihu asks what kept them there; what prevented their falling to the earth; what preserved the equilibrium so that they did not all roll together. The phenomena of the clouds would be among the first that would attract the attention of man, and in the early times of Job it is not to be supposed that the subject could be explained. Elihu assumes that they were held in the sky by the power of God, but what was the nature of his agency, he says, man could not understand, and hence, he infers that God should be regarded with profound veneration. We know more of the facts and laws respecting the clouds than was understood then, but our knowledge in this, as in all other things, is fitted only to exalt our conceptions of the Deity, and to change blind wonder into intelligent adoration.<p>The causes of the suspension of the clouds are thus stated in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia, Art. Meteorology: "When different portions of the atmosphere are intermixed so as to produce a deposition of moisture;" (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-28.htm">Job 38:28</a>), "the consequence will be the formation of a cloud. This cloud, from its increased specific gravity, will have a tendency to sink downward; and were the lower strata of the air of the same temperature with the cloud, and saturated with moisture, it would continue to descend until it reached the surface of the earth - in the form of rain, or what is commonly called mist. In general, however, the cloud in its descent passes through a warmer region, when the condensed moisture again passes into a vapor, and consequently ascends until it reaches a temperature sufficiently low to recondense it, when it will begin again to sink. This oscillation will continue until the cloud settles at the point where the temperature and humidity are such as that the condensed moisture begins to be dissipated, and which is found on an average to be between two and three miles above the surface of the earth." By such laws the "balancing" of the clouds is secured, and thus is shown the wisdom of Him that is "perfect in knowledge."<p>The wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge - Particularly in the matter under consideration. He who can command the lightning, and hold the clouds suspended in the air, Elihu infers must be perfect in knowledge. To a Being who can do this, everything must be known. The reasoning of Elihu here is well-founded, and is not less forcible now than it was in the time of Job. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. Hebrew, "Hast thou understanding of the balancings," &c., how the clouds are poised in the air, so that their watery gravity does not bring them to the earth? The condensed moisture, descending by gravity, meets a warmer temperature, which dissipates it into vapor (the tendency of which is to ascend) and so counteracts the descending force.<p>perfect in knowledge&#8212;God; not here in the sense that Elihu uses it of himself (Job 36:4).<p>dost thou know&#8212;how, &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The balancings; </span> how God doth as it were weigh and suspend the clouds in balances; so that although they are ponderous and flail of water, yet they are by his power kept up in the thin air from falling down upon us in spouts and floods, as sometimes they have done, and generally would do, if not overruled by a higher Providence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which is perfect in knowledge; </span> who exactly knows the weight.

Thence next ha&#770;wijatun, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  equals  hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, huwa&#770;atun, mahwa&#770;tun, a cleft, yawning deep, chasm, abyss, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, vorago; haw&#305;&#770;jatun and hauha&#770;tun (a reduplicated form), especially a very deep pit or well. But these same words, ha&#770;wijatun, hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, mahwa&#770;tun, also signify, like the usual Arab. hawa'a&#770;'un, the &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; between heaven and earth, i.e., the wide, empty space, the same as 'gauwun. The wider significations, or rather applications and references of hawa&#770;: air set in motion, a current of air, wind, weather, are all secondary, and related to that primary signification as sama&#770;, rain-clouds, rain, grass produced by the rain, to the prim. signification height, heaven, vid., Mehren, Rhetorik d. Araber, S. 107, Z. 14ff. This hawa&#770;, however, also signifies in general: a broad, empty space, and by transferring the notion of "empty" to mind and heart, as the reduplicated forms hu&#770;hatun and hauha&#770;tun: devoid of understanding and devoid of courage, e.g., Koran xiv. 44: wa-af'i-datuhum hawa&#770;un, where Bedhw first explains hawa&#770; directly by chala&#770;, emptiness, empty space, i.e., as he adds, cha&#770;lijetun &#8219;an el-fahm, as one says of one without mind and courage qalbuhu hawa&#770;un. Thence also hauwun, emptiness, a hole, i.e., in a wall or roof, a dormar-window (kauwe, ku&#770;we), but also with the genit. of a person or thing: their hole, i.e., the space left empty by them, the side not taken up by them, e.g., qa&#8219;ada fi hauwihi, he set himself beside him. From the signification to be empty then comes (1) hawat el-mar'atu, i.e., vacua fuit mulier  equals  orba oiberis, as &#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, vidua, properly empty, French vide; (2) hawa&#770; er-ragulu, i.e., vacuus, inanis factus est vir  equals  exanimatus (comp. Arab. frg, he became empty, euphemistic for he died).<p>From this variously applied primary signification is developed the generally known and usual Arab. hawa&#770;, loose and free, without being held or holding to anything one's self, to pass away, fly, swing, etc., libere ferri, labi, in general in every direction, as the wind, or what is driven hither and thither by the wind, especially however from above downwards, labi, delabi, cadere, deorsum ruere. From this point, like many similar, the word first passes into the signification of sound (as certainly also &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, &#1513;&#1488;): as anything falling has a full noise, and so on, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, rumorem, fragorem edere (fragor from frangi), hence hawat udhnuhu jaw&#305;&#770;jan of a singing in the ears.<p>continued...</body></html>
