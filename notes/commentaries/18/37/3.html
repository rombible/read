We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He directeth it under the whole heaven - It is under the control of God, and he directs it where he pleases.

Thus the ministers of the word, who are compared to clouds, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>, are charged with it by the Lord: they are directed by him what they shall say, where they shall go and declare it, and he directs where it shall fall with power and weight; yea, he directs it into the very hearts of men, where it pierces and penetrates, and is a discerner and discoverer of their thoughts and intents; <p>and his lightning unto the ends of the earth: it cometh out of the east, and shineth to the west, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>; and swiftly move to the further parts of the earth: and such a direction, motion, and extent, has the Gospel had; the glorious light of it, comparable to lightning, it first broke forth in the east, where Christ, his forerunner and his disciples, first preached it, and Christian churches were formed; and from thence it spread into the western parts of the world, and before the destruction of Jerusalem it was preached unto all nations; it had a free course, ran, and was glorified; the sound of the voice of it went into all the earth, and the words and doctrines of the apostles unto the ends of the world. <p>(x) Nat.

Similarly, the lightning, though originating in a flash at some definite spot, sets the whole sky aglow, shining from side to side of the heavens, and, as it were, to the very "ends of the earth."

Others as (Umbr., Ew.) the masses of water drawn up to the sky out of the depths of the sea, on which a Persian passage cited by Stick. (who, however, regards the Waw of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; as Waw adaequationis) from Schebisteri may be compared: "an exhalation rises up out of the sea, and comes down at God's command upon the deserts." In both cases &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; would be equivalent to &#1499;&#1505;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, obtegit se, which in and of itself is possible. But he who has once witnessed a storm in the neighbourhood of the sea, will decide in favour of one of the three following explanations: (1.) He covereth the uprooted ground of the sea (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>.) with the subsiding waves (Blumenf.); but then <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-30.htm">Job 36:30</a> would require to be understood of the light of the brightening sky following the darkness of the storm, which is improbable in respect of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-32.htm">Job 36:32</a>. (2.) While the sky is brilliantly lighted up by the lightning, the abysses of the ocean are veiled in a so much deeper darkness; the observation is correct, but not less so another, that the lightning by a thunder-storm, especially when occurring at night, descends into the depths of the sea like snares that are cast down (&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>), and the water is momentarily changed as it were into a sea of flame; accordingly it may be explained, (3.) Behold, He spreadeth over Himself His light (viz., the light which incessantly illumines the world), and the roots of the sea, i.e., the sea down to its depths, He covers with it, since He makes it light through and through (Stuhlm. Wolfs.).
