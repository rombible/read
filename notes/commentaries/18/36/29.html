Man may see God's works, and is capable of discerning his hand in them, which the beasts are not, therefore they ought to give him the glory. But while the worker of iniquity ought to tremble, the true believer should rejoice. Children should hear with pleasure their Father's voice, even when he speaks in terror to his enemies. There is no light but there may be a cloud to intercept it. The light of the favour of God, the light of his countenance, the most blessed light of all, even that light has many a cloud. The clouds of our sins cause the Lord to his face, and hinder the light of his loving-kindness from shining on our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Also, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds? - The out spreading - the manner in which they expand themselves over us. The idea is, that the manner in which the clouds seem to "spread out," or unfold themselves on the sky, could not be explained, and was a striking proof of the wisdom and power of God. In the early periods of the world, it could not be expected that the causes of these phenomena would be known. Now that the causes "are" better known, however, they do not less indicate the wisdom and power of God, nor are these facts less fitted to excite our wonder. The simple and beautiful laws by which the clouds are suspended; by which they roll in the sky; by which they spread themselves out - as in a rising tempest, and by which they seem to unfold themselves over the heavens, should increase, rather than diminish, our conceptions of the wisdom and power of the Most High.<p>Or, the noise of his tabernacle - Referring, doubtless, to thunder. The clouds are represented as a tent or pavilion spread out for the dwelling of God (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>), and the idea here is, that the noise made in a thunder-storm is in the unique dwelling of God. Herder well expresses it, "The fearful thunderings in his tent," compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a> - <p>He made darkness his secret place,<p>His pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.<p>The sense here is, who can understand and explain the cause of thunder? The object of Elihu in this is, to show how great and incomprehensible is God, and nature furnishes few more impressive illustrations of this than the crash of thunder. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

Or "of a cloud" (l), a thick cloud, a single one; which sometimes at the beginning is very small, about the size of a man's hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-44.htm">1 Kings 18:44</a>; and which in a little time spreads all over the heavens, and covers them with black clouds and darkness; none can understand, describe, and tell by what means so small a cloud at first appearance is spread to such a prodigious extent; and which is done partly for the use of God himself, to be a pavilion or tent around him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>; and partly for the use of men, either to let down ram on the several parts of the world, or to be a sort of an umbrella to men, to shelter them from scorching heat; nor can any understand how the clouds, stretched out to such a compass, are poised and balanced in the air, so as to retain their position as long as it is the pleasure of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-16.htm">Job 37:16</a>. Ben Gersom, who is followed by others (m), interprets this of the differences of the clouds, which are unaccountable, as to the form and colour of them being curious, and the matter which they contain or what issues from them; out of some rain, others hail, others snow and sleet, others wind, others thunder and lightning; and yet all arise from the same, even from vapours exhaled from the earth and sea; some become moist and cold, others hot and dry. As clouds are emblems of Gospel ministers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; this may lead us to observe the different gifts of grace bestowed on them, and the different uses they are of; some are Boanergeses, sons of thunder, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-17.htm">Mark 3:17</a>; others Barnabases, sons of consolation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>; and the extent of the Gospel ministry all over the world, which first began as a small cloud over the land of Judea, and then was spread throughout the Gentile world; <p>or the noise of his tabernacle; the tabernacle of God, which are the clouds, which are laid as the flooring of his palace, and are drawn about him as a tent or pavilion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>, where he sits invisible, and from whence, as a general of an army, he issues out his orders, and sends forth his artillery, rain, hail, snow, thunder, and lightning, and stormy wind fulfilling his word; the noise hereof is either the noise of the waters in the clouds, the sound of an abundance of rain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41</a>; or of the blustering winds, by which the clouds are moved and portend rain; or of the thunder that bursts out of them with a vehement noise, and which is usually followed with rain; and the thunder of his power who can understand? <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>. This may be an emblem of the voice of God in his Gospel out of his tabernacle, the church, which the natural man understands not; or the voice of God in his providences, in which he speaks to men once and twice, and they perceive it not. <p>(l) "nubis", Montanus, Tigurine version, Mercerus, Piscator, Schultens.

The “spreadings” of the clouds refers probably to the accumulation and diffusion of the storm clouds over the heavens; and the second clause to the loud thundering within the dark cloud, where God is enshrouded, and which is therefore called His “pavilion.” So the word is rendered <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm" title="He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.">Psalm 18:11</a>, where the representation is similar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">29, 30</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-30.htm" title="Behold, he spreads his light on it, and covers the bottom of the sea.">Job 36:30</a> needs some modification—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>29.&emsp;&emsp;Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the crashings of his pavilion?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>30.&emsp;&emsp;Behold, he spreadeth his light around him,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And covereth him over with the deeps of the sea.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds?</span> The rapid generation of clouds, their gathering together, seemingly, from all quarters, and the way they almost suddenly overspread the heavens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-45.htm">1 Kings 18:45</a>). are among the most remarkable phenomena of nature, and are very difficult to "understand" and account for. <span class="cmt_word">Or the noise of his tabernacle</span>.
