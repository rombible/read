He is always ready to defend those that are injured. If our eye is ever toward God in duty, his eye will be ever upon us in mercy, and, when we are at the lowest, will not overlook us. God intends, when he afflicts us, to discover past sins to us, and to bring them to our remembrance. Also, to dispose our hearts to be taught: affliction makes people willing to learn, through the grace of God working with and by it. And further, to deter us from sinning for the future. It is a command, to have no more to do with sin. If we faithfully serve God, we have the promise of the life that now is, and the comforts of it, as far as is for God's glory and our good: and who would desire them any further? We have the possession of inward pleasures, the great peace which those have that love God's law. If the affliction fail in its work, let men expect the furnace to be heated till they are consumed. Those that die without knowledge, die without grace, and are undone for ever. See the nature of hypocrisy; it lies in the heart: that is for the world and the flesh, while perhaps the outside seems to be for God and religion. Whether sinners die in youth, or live long to heap up wrath, their case is dreadful. The souls of the wicked live after death, but it is in everlasting misery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous - That is, he constantly observes them, whether they are in the more elevated or humble ranks of life. Even though he afflicts them, his eye is upon them, and he does not forsake them. It will be remembered that one of the difficulties to be accounted for was, that they who professed to be righteous are subjected to severe trials. The friends of Job had maintained that such a fact was in itself proof that they who professed to be pious were not so, but were hypocrites. Job had verged to the other extreme, and had said that it looked as if God had forsaken those that loved him, and that there was no advantage in being righteous; notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-2.htm">Job 35:2</a>. Elihu takes a middle ground, and says that neither was the correct opinion. It is true, he says, that the righteous are afflicted, but they are not forsaken. The eye of God is still upon them, and he watches over them, whether on the throne or in dungeons, in order "to bring good results" out of their trials.<p>But with kings are they on the throne - That is, if the righteous are in the state of the highest earthly honor and prosperity, God is with them, and is their protector and friend. The same thing Elihu, in the following verses, says is true respecting the righteous, when they are in the most down-trodden and depressed condition.<p>Yea, he doth establish them for ever - The meaning of this is, that they are regarded by God with favor. When righteous kings "are" thus prospered, and have a permanent and peaceful reign, it is God who gives this prosperity to them. They are under his watchful eye, and his protecting hand. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. (1Pe 3:12). God does not forsake the godly, as Job implied, but "establishes," or makes them sit on the throne as kings (1Sa 2:8; Ps 113:7, 8).

His eyes of providence are upon them to supply their temporal wants, and to protect and defend them from their enemies, and they are never off of them; his eyes of love, grace, and mercy, are upon them; he always viewed them as righteous in his Son, and through his righteousness imputed; and looked upon them with delight and pleasure, and always so views them; they are engraven on his heart and on his hands, and are ever before him, and in his sight: and his eyes are upon them from the beginning of the year to the end of it, yea, from one eternity to another; these were set upon them from everlasting, and are upon them in time; at the time of their conversion to quicken them, and call them by his grace; and afterwards they continue upon them under all their afflictions, temptations, and desertions, and ever will remain on them; they will never be withdrawn, nothing can separate them from the love of God; <p>but with kings are they on the throne; that is, either the eyes of the Lord are with them, even with righteous kings, as the Targum; to guide and direct them in the affairs of government, and to protect and preserve them from the designs of evil men: or the righteous are with kings on the throne, or are the favourites of kings that are on thrones; are admitted into their presence, and are highly esteemed by them, and have honour conferred on them, even to be the next to them in the throne and kingdom, as Joseph and Daniel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41</a>, or rather, the righteous are equal to kings on the throne; they are so accounted of by the Lord as kings; they are made by him kings and priests, and are regarded by him as such; they have the power, and riches, and honour of kings; they have a kingdom of grace bestowed on them now, and a kingdom of glory they are entitled to hereafter; and shall reign with Christ on earth a thousand years, and in the ultimate glory to all eternity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>; <p>yea, he doth establish them for ever; as righteous persons in their righteousness, which is an everlasting one; so that they shall never come into condemnation: they are established in the love of God, in the covenant of grace, in the hands of Christ, and in a state of grace now, and shall be in a stable permanent state of happiness to all eternity; <p>and they are exalted: now, being raised as beggars from the dung hill to sit among princes, even among the princes of God's people; and they will be exalted hereafter, and sit at Christ's right hand, and be introduced into his kingdom, where they will be set down with him in his throne, and reign with him for ever and ever, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> kings <i>are they</i> on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</span><p>(e) He prefers the godly to honour.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

Under no circumstances does God cease to keep an eye upon the righteous, as Job had seemed to imply when he exclaimed, "Oh that I were as in months of old, in the days when God preserved me!" or "watched me!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-2.htm">Job 29:2</a>). "The eyes of the Lord are" always "upon the righteous, as his ears are open unto their <span class="accented">cry"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With kings are they on the throne</span>. In some cases, God shows his care of the righteous by "setting them with princes, even with the princes of his people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113-8.htm">Psalm 113:8</a>), raising them, that is, to high station, and making them companions of the great of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted</span>. They are permanently established in their high positions, like Joseph and Mordecai and Daniel; and they are exalted to the highest pitch of prosperity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then Elihu continued and said:<p>  2  Suffer me a little, and I will inform thee,<p>For there is something still to be said for Eloah.<p>  3  I will fetch my knowledge from afar,<p>And to my Creator will I ascribe right.<p>  4  For truly my words are not lies,<p>One perfect in knowledge stands before thee.<p>Elihu's preceding three speeches were introduced by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1503;; this fourth, in honour of the number three, is introduced only as a continuation of the others. Job is to wait yet a little while, for he still has ( equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;), or: there still are, words in favour of Eloah; i.e., what may be said in vindication of God against Job's complaints and accusations is not yet exhausted. This appears to be the only instance of the Aramaic &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; being taken up as Hebr.; whereas &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, nunciare (Arab. wh&#803;a&#770;, I, IV), is a poetic Aramaism occurring even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-3.htm">Psalm 19:3</a> (comp. on the construction <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>); and &#1494;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (a diminutive form, after the manner of the Arab. zu&#8219;air) belongs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-13.htm">Isaiah 28:13</a> to the popular language (of Jerusalem), but is here used poetically. The verb &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-3.htm">Job 36:3</a>, is not to be understood according to &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, but according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>; and &#1500;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; signifies, as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-29.htm">Job 39:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>, e longinquo, viz., out of the wide realm of history and nature.
