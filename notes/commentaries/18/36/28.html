Man may see God's works, and is capable of discerning his hand in them, which the beasts are not, therefore they ought to give him the glory. But while the worker of iniquity ought to tremble, the true believer should rejoice. Children should hear with pleasure their Father's voice, even when he speaks in terror to his enemies. There is no light but there may be a cloud to intercept it. The light of the favour of God, the light of his countenance, the most blessed light of all, even that light has many a cloud. The clouds of our sins cause the Lord to his face, and hinder the light of his loving-kindness from shining on our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon man abundantly - That is, upon many people. The clouds having received the ascending vapor, retain it, and pour it down copiously for the use of man. The arrangement, to the eye even of one who did not understand the scientific principles by which it is done, is beautiful and wonderful; the beauty and wonder are increased when the laws by which it is accomplished are understood. Elihu does not attempt to explain the mode by which this is done. The fact was probably all that was then understood, and that was sufficient for his purpose. The Septuagint has given a translation of this verse which cannot be well accounted for, and which is certainly very unlike the original. It is, "But when the clouds east a shade over the dumb creation, he impresseth a care on beasts, and they know the order for retiring to rest - &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  koite&#772;s taxin.

Not upon the persons of men, which they take care as much as possible to shun and avoid, but upon the fields of men, and so for the profit and advantage of men; and this denotes both the gentle manner in which the clouds let down rain, and the liberal profusion of them; they let it down both in an easy and plentiful manner, and upon an abundance of men, or upon an abundance of fields and lands belonging to men; though sometimes rain falls upon the wilderness, where no man is, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26</a>. The Targum is, <p>"at the prayer of a son of a great man,'' <p>or at the prayer of a man that has great interest with God; that is famous for his faith and piety, as Elijah was, to whom perhaps the Targumist may have respect. The rain is an emblem of the word of God, the Gospel of Christ, which drops and distils on the souls of men like rain, and refreshes them, and makes them fruitful; and is dispensed by the ministers of it, who are compared to clouds, according to the measure of the gift of grace received by them, and that freely and fully as they have received it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">upon man abundantly</span>] This is possible, but the more natural meaning is as above, the reference being to the universal reach of the rain, and its fall on all mankind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">29â€“37:5</span>.

For (1) &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; (from &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-12.htm">Psalm 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>) has no etymological connection with mr (of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;, Arab. maru'a, opimum, robustum esse); (2) it is, moreover, peculiar to Elihu to represent God as a teacher both by dreams and dispensations of affliction, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-32.htm">Job 34:32</a>, and by His creatures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-11.htm">Job 35:11</a>; and (3) the designation of God as an incomparable teacher is also not inappropriate here, after His rule is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-22.htm">Job 36:22</a> as transcendently exalted, which on that very account commands to human research a reverence which esteems itself lightly. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-23.htm">Job 36:23</a> is not to be translated: who overlooketh Him in His way? (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; with &#1506;&#1500; of the personal and acc. of the neutral obj.), which is without support in the language; but: who has prescribed to Him (&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a>) His way? i.e., as Rosenm. correctly interprets: quis ei praescripsit quae agere deberet, He is no mandatory, is responsible to no one, and under obligation to no one, and who should dare to say (quis dixerit; on the perf. comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>): Thou doest evil? - man shall be a docile learner, not a self-satisfied, conceited censurer of the absolute One, whose rule is not to be judged according to the laws of another, but according to His own laws.
