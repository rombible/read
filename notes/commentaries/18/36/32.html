Man may see God's works, and is capable of discerning his hand in them, which the beasts are not, therefore they ought to give him the glory. But while the worker of iniquity ought to tremble, the true believer should rejoice. Children should hear with pleasure their Father's voice, even when he speaks in terror to his enemies. There is no light but there may be a cloud to intercept it. The light of the favour of God, the light of his countenance, the most blessed light of all, even that light has many a cloud. The clouds of our sins cause the Lord to his face, and hinder the light of his loving-kindness from shining on our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Terrors come upon him like waters,<p>In the night a tempest stealeth him away.<p>The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth,<p>And it sweeps him away from his place. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20-21</a>.<p>(c) The dew had been carefully observed, yet the speakers did not understand its phenomena. How it was produced; whether it descended from the atmosphere, or ascended from the earth, they did not profess to be able to explain. It was regarded as one of the things which God only could understand; yet the manner in which it is spoken of shows that it had attracted deep attention, and led to much inquiry:<p>Hath the rain a father?<p>And who hath begotten the drops of the dew? <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-28.htm">Job 38:28</a>.<p>(d) The same remarks may be made of the formation of the hoar frost, of snow, of hail, and of ice. There is no theory suggested to account for them but they are regarded as among the things which God alone could comprehend, and which evinced his wisdom. There had been evidently much careful observation of the facts, and much inquiry into the cause of these things but the speakers did not profess to be able to explain them. To this day, also, there is much about them which is unexplained, and the farther the investigation is carried, the more occasion is there to admire the wisdom of God in the formation of these things, See the notes on the passages that will now be referred to:<p>From whose womb came the ice;<p>The hoar-frost of heaven, who gave it birth? <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-29.htm">Job 38:29</a> (note).<p>By the breath of God frost is produced,<p>And the broad waters become compressed. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-10.htm">Job 37:10</a> (note).<p>For he saith to the snow, "Be thou on the earth." <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a> (note).<p>Hast thou been into the storehouses of snow?<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.

Thus, as in Job 36:31, the twofold effects of His waters are set forth, so here, of His light; in the one hand, destructive lightning against the wicked; in the other, the genial light for good to His friends, &c.

Either the lightning, which is hid and covered in the black dark cloud until it bursts out of it; or the light of the sun, which is wonderful, that waters naturally clear and transparent, when formed into clouds, should obstruct the rays of the sun and darken it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; and thus it was in the storm and tempest the Apostle Paul was in many days, which was so thick and dark, that the sun and stars did not appear of a long time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-20.htm">Acts 27:20</a>; <p>and commandeth it not to shine, by the cloud that cometh betwixt; that is, commands the sun that it shines not, or hinders it from shining, by reason of the intervening clouds; this is an emblem of sin interposing between God and his people, which causes him to hide his face from them and not shine upon them: sins are comparable to clouds for numbers, being more than can be told; and for their nature and quality, like clouds they rise out of the earthly and carnal heart of man; and which is also like a troubled sea which cannot rest; and which reach up unto heaven and bring down wrath and vengeance from thence on wicked men; and in God's own people, like the clouds they intercept the light of his countenance, the bright shining of the sun of righteousness, the comfort, peace, and joy of the Holy Spirit: the words may be rendered, "with hands he covers the light, and commands that it shine not by reason of what comes between": and they are understood by some, as by Schmidt particularly, of the eclipses of the sun and moon, when God as it were covers them with hands, and suffers them not to shine by intervening bodies; so the eclipse of the sun is occasioned by the moon's coming between that and the earth, and the eclipse of the moon by the interposition of the earth between that and the sun; the Targum is, <p>"because of rapine of hands he restrains rain, and commands it to descend because of him that prays,'' <p>who comes between and intercedes for a sinful people, as Elijah did; or, as others, he commands the lightning that it harms not because of him that comes between and intercedes with his prayers. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it <i>not to shine</i> by <i>the cloud</i> that cometh <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> betwixt.</span><p>(z) That is, one cloud to dash against another.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32–33</span>.

In what follows Elihu describes the wondrous origin of rain. "If Job had only come," says a Midrash (Jalkut, 518), "to explain to us the matter of the race of the deluge (vid., especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15-18</a>), it had been sufficient; and if Elihu had only come to explain to us the matter of the origin of rain (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1514; &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), it had been enough." In Gesenius' Handwrterbuch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27</a> is translated: when He has drawn up the drops of water to Himself, then, etc. But it is &#1497;&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;, not &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; neither in Hebr. nor in Arab. signifies attrahere in sublime (Rosenm.), but only attrahere (root &#1490;&#1512;) and detrahere; the latter signification is the prevailing one in Hebr.

With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; the transcendent exaltation of the Being who survives all changes of creation is shown by an example: He draws away (draws off, as it were) the water-drops, viz., from the waters that are confined above on the circle of the sky, which pass over us as mist and cloud (vid., Genesis, S. 107); and these water-drops distil down (&#1494;&#1511;&#1511;, to ooze, distil, here not in a transitive but an intransitive signification, since the water-drops are the rain itself) as rain, &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;, with its mist, i.e., since a mist produced by it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-6.htm">Genesis 2:6</a>) fills the expanse (&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;), the downfall of which is just this rain, which, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-28.htm">Job 36:28</a> says, the clouds (called &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; on account of its thin strata of air, in distinction from the next mist-circle) cause to flow gently down upon the multitude of men, i.e., far and wide over the mass of men who inhabit the district visited by the rain; both verbs are used transitively here, both &#1504;&#1494;&#1500; as <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>, and &#1512;&#1506;&#1507;, as evidently <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20</a>. &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-29.htm">Job 36:29</a>, commences an intensive question: moreover, could one understand  equals  could one completely understand; which certainly, according to the sense, is equivalent to: how much less (&#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;). &#1488;&#1501; is, however, the interrogative an, and &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1501; corresponds to &#1492;&#1488;&#1507; in the first member of the double question, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-8.htm">Job 40:8</a>. &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; are not the burstings, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, frangere, findere, but spreadings, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a> shows, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, expandere, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>, comp. supra on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>.
