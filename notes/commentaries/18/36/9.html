This is Elihu’s special doctrine, that God’s chastisements are by way of discipline, to reform the future rather than to chastise the past.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:5-14 Elihu here shows that God acts as righteous Governor. He is always ready to defend those that are injured. If our eye is ever toward God in duty, his eye will be ever upon us in mercy, and, when we are at the lowest, will not overlook us. God intends, when he afflicts us, to discover past sins to us, and to bring them to our remembrance. Also, to dispose our hearts to be taught: affliction makes people willing to learn, through the grace of God working with and by it. And further, to deter us from sinning for the future. It is a command, to have no more to do with sin. If we faithfully serve God, we have the promise of the life that now is, and the comforts of it, as far as is for God's glory and our good: and who would desire them any further? We have the possession of inward pleasures, the great peace which those have that love God's law. If the affliction fail in its work, let men expect the furnace to be heated till they are consumed. Those that die without knowledge, die without grace, and are undone for ever. See the nature of hypocrisy; it lies in the heart: that is for the world and the flesh, while perhaps the outside seems to be for God and religion. Whether sinners die in youth, or live long to heap up wrath, their case is dreadful. The souls of the wicked live after death, but it is in everlasting misery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then he showeth them their work - What their lives have been. This he does either by a messenger sent to them <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm">Job 33:23</a>, or by their own reflections <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-27.htm">Job 33:27</a>, or by the influences of his Spirit leading them to a proper review of their lives. The object of their affliction, Elihu says, is to bring them to see what their conduct has been, and to reform what has been amiss. It should not be interpreted either as proof that the afflicted are eminently wicked, as the friends of Job maintained, or as furnishing an occasion for severe reflections on the divine government, such as Job had indulged in. It is all consistent with an equitable and kind administration; with the belief that the afflicted have true piety - though they have wandered and erred; and with the conviction that God is dealing with them in mercy, and not in the severity of wrath. They need only recal the errors of their lives; humble themselves, and exercise true repentance, and they would find afflictions to be among even their richest blessings.<p>Transgressions that they have exceeded - Or, rather, "he shows them their transgressions that they have been very great"; that they have made themselves great, mighty, strong - &#1497;&#1514;&#1490;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;  yitga&#770;baru&#770;. The idea is, that their transgressions had been allowed to accumulate, or to become strong, until it was necessary to interpose in this manner, and check them by severe affliction. All this was consistent, however, with the belief that the sufferer was truly pious and might find favor if he would repent. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. work&#8212;transgression.<p>that &#8230; exceeded&#8212;"In that they behaved themselves mightily" (literally, "great"); that is, presumptuously, or, at least, self-confidently.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their work, </span> i.e. their evil works, as the next clause explains and limits it.

Either what they ought to do, so the Tigurine version; and which they have not done, their sins of omission; when they have been negligent either of the duty of prayer in private and public, or of attendance on the ordinances of the house of God; then he sends an affliction, and by it, as in a glass, presents to their view the omissions they have been guilty of: or else the work which they have done, and should not have done, their sins of commission: sin is a work at which some toil and labour, and weary themselves to commit; it is a work of the flesh; and so it is in good men; it is a man's own work, and which he can work of himself; to have a will, and to do good works, is owing to God working in his people, and it is through him strengthening them they do them; but sin fill works are their own act and deed, though tempted to them by others, and which they are able to do of their own freewill and power. Now God, in the glass of affliction, holds forth to view the sinful actions of good men, and brings them to their remembrance which they had forgotten; as the cases of Joseph's brethren, David, and others, prove: the Lord shows them that they have done such actions, and shows them the evil of them, how exceeding sinful they are; and humbles them under a sense of them, and brings them to repentance for them, and the acknowledgment of them; which sense is confirmed by the next clause, which explains what this their work is, <p>and their transgressions that they have exceeded. Sin is a transgression of the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>; every sin, greater or lesser, is, and even righteous persons are guilty of many; for there is not a just man that sinneth not; and these exceed the bounds set by the righteous law of God, and many of them are sadly aggravated by the light and knowledge, grace and mercy, such have been favoured with; and some of them, they are suffered to fall into, are exceeding great and exceeding sinful; such as those of David, Peter, and others; all which they are made to see, bewail, and weep over, when God by afflictions brings them to a sense of them. Or "when" or "because they have prevailed" (m); or begin to prevail: as soon as ever indwelling sin begins to be prevalent, the Lord is pleased to take measures to nip it in the bud, by sending a sharp and severe affliction; or when it has prevailed greatly, as sometimes it does, so that good is hindered from being done, and much evil is committed, then the soul is so much under the power of it, as to be carried captive with it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a>. Or "because they are become proud", or "behaved themselves proudly" (n); and therefore he afflicts them to humble them, and drive pride from them. <p>(m)  "quum invalescunt", Mercerus; "quum invaluerunt", Munster, Piscator; so Drusius, Panginus, Bolducius.

God, by his chastisements, makes men see what has been faulty in their life's work, in what respects they have been negligent, where they have lapsed into actual sin. Signal afflictions are a call to men to "consider their ways," and search out the nature of their offences. Some afflictions, as sickness and imprisonment, by depriving men of active employment, almost force them to engage in such a retrospect. <span class="cmt_word">And their transgressions that they have exceeded</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and their transgressions</span> <span class="accented">wherein they have behaved themselves proudly</span> (compare the Revised Version). In all sin, as it is a contempt of God's Law, there is an element of pride. The temptation to pride especially besets those whose conduct is, in outward appearance, correct and virtuous. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then Elihu continued and said:<p>  2  Suffer me a little, and I will inform thee,<p>For there is something still to be said for Eloah.<p>  3  I will fetch my knowledge from afar,<p>And to my Creator will I ascribe right.<p>  4  For truly my words are not lies,<p>One perfect in knowledge stands before thee.<p>Elihu's preceding three speeches were introduced by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1503;; this fourth, in honour of the number three, is introduced only as a continuation of the others. Job is to wait yet a little while, for he still has ( equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;), or: there still are, words in favour of Eloah; i.e., what may be said in vindication of God against Job's complaints and accusations is not yet exhausted. This appears to be the only instance of the Aramaic &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; being taken up as Hebr.; whereas &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, nunciare (Arab. wh&#803;a&#770;, I, IV), is a poetic Aramaism occurring even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-3.htm">Psalm 19:3</a> (comp. on the construction <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>); and &#1494;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (a diminutive form, after the manner of the Arab. zu&#8219;air) belongs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-13.htm">Isaiah 28:13</a> to the popular language (of Jerusalem), but is here used poetically. The verb &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-3.htm">Job 36:3</a>, is not to be understood according to &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, but according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>; and &#1500;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; signifies, as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-29.htm">Job 39:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>, e longinquo, viz., out of the wide realm of history and nature.
