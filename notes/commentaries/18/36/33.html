We may translate the first clause, “The noise thereof (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the crash of the thunder) declareth concerning Him:” it is His voice, and speaks of Him; but the last clause is almost unintelligible. The words as they stand mean, or may mean, <span class= "ital">cattle even concerning a goer up; </span>but what this means who shall say? Possibly, <span class= "ital">the thunder-crash telleth the cattle even concerning Him who goeth up: i.e.</span>, even the cattle show, by their terror, that the thunder speaketh to them of God, who goeth up on high. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-9.htm" title="The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests: and in his temple does every one speak of his glory.">Psalm 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-4.htm" title="Sing to God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rides on the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.">Psalm 68:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-5.htm" title="God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.">Psalm 47:5</a>.) Some render the last clause, “The cattle also concerning Him as He riseth up;” or, “The cattle also concerning the rising storm.” There can be no doubt but that the general meaning is that all nature participateth in the terror caused by the thunder, which is regarded as the audible voice of God; but what the exact expression of this general thought may be it is very hard to say.<p>There should he no break between this chapter and the next.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:24-33 Elihu endeavours to fill Job with high thought of God, and so to persuade him into cheerful submission to his providence. Man may see God's works, and is capable of discerning his hand in them, which the beasts are not, therefore they ought to give him the glory. But while the worker of iniquity ought to tremble, the true believer should rejoice. Children should hear with pleasure their Father's voice, even when he speaks in terror to his enemies. There is no light but there may be a cloud to intercept it. The light of the favour of God, the light of his countenance, the most blessed light of all, even that light has many a cloud. The clouds of our sins cause the Lord to his face, and hinder the light of his loving-kindness from shining on our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The noise thereof showeth concerning it - The word "noise" here has been inserted by our translators as a version of the Hebrew word (&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;  re&#770;&#8219;o&#770;), and if the translators attached any idea to the language which they have used, it seems to have been that the noise attending the lightning, that is, the thunder, furnished an illustration of the power and majesty of God. But it is not possible to educe this idea from the original, and perhaps it is not possible to determine the sense of the passage. Herder renders it, "He pointeth out to them the wicked." Prof. Lee, "By it he announceth his will." Umbreit, "He makes known to it his friend;" that is, he points out his friend to the light, so that it may serve for the happiness of that friend. Noyes, "He uttereth to him his voice; to the herds and the plants." Rosenmuller," He announces what he has decreed against people, and the flocks which the earth has produced."<p>Many other expositions have been proposed, and there is no reasonable ground of hope that an interpretation will be arrived at which will be free from all difficulty. The principal difficulty in this part of the verse arises from the word &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;  re&#770;&#8219;o&#770;, rendered in our version, "The noise thereof." This may be from &#1512;&#1493;&#1506;  ru&#770;a&#8219;, and may mean a noise, or outcry, and so it is rendered here by Gesenius, "He makes known to him his thunder, that is, to man, or to his enemies." Or the word may mean "his friend," as the word &#1512;&#1506;  re&#770;a&#8219; is often used; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-21.htm">Job 19:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>; Sol 5:16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>. Or it may denote "will, thought, desire;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>. A choice must be made between these different meanings according to the view entertained of the scope of the passage. To me it seems that the word ""friend"" will better suit the connection than anyone of the other interpretations proposed. According to this, the idea is, that God points out "his friends" to the lightning which he holds in his hand, and bids it spare them. He has entire control of it, and can direct it where he pleases, and instead of sending it forth to work indiscriminate destruction, he carefully designates those on whom he wishes it to strike, but bids it spare his friends.<p>The cattle also concerning the vapour - Margin, "that which goeth up." What idea the translators attached to this phrase it is impossible now to know, and the probability is, that being conscious of utter inability to give any meaning to the passage, they endeavored to translate the "words" of the original as literally as possible. Coverdale evidently felt the same perplexity, for he renders it, "The rising up thereof showeth he to his friends and to the cattle." Indeed almost every translator and expositor has had the same difficulty, and each one has proposed a version of his own. Aa examination of the "words" employed is the only hope of arriving at any satisfactory view of the passage. The word rendered "cattle" (&#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;  miqneh), means properly:<p>(1) expectation, hope, confidence; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-2.htm">Ezra 10:2</a>;<p>(2) a gathering together, a collection, as<p>(a) of waters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a>,<p>(b) a gathering together, a collection, or company of people, horses, etc. - a caravan. So it may possibly mean in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>, where interpreters have greatly differed.<p>The word "cattle," therefore, by no means expresses its usual signification. That would be better expressed by "gathering, collecting," or "assembling." The word rendered also (&#1488;&#1507;  'aph), denotes:<p>(1) also, even, more, besides, etc., and<p>(2) "the nose," and then "anger" - from the effect of anger in producing hard breathing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-24.htm">Proverbs 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-20.htm">Deuteronomy 29:20</a>.<p>Here it may be rendered, without impropriety, "anger," and then the phrase will mean, "the collecting, or gathering together of anger." The word rendered "vapour" (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;ovela&#770;h - if from &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;a&#770;la&#770;h), means that which "ascends," and would then mean anything that ascends - as smoke, vapor; or as Rosenmuller supposes, what "ascends" or "grows" from the ground - that is, plants and vegetables, And so Umbreit, "das Gewachs" - "plants of any kind." Note. But with a slight variation in the pointing &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;ovela&#770;h - instead of &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;oleh), the word means "evil, wickedness, iniquity" - from our word "evil;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-20.htm">Job 24:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-29.htm">Job 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-14.htm">Job 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-7.htm">Job 13:7</a>; and it may, without impropriety, be regarded as having this signification here, as the points have no authority. The meaning of the whole phrase then will be, "the gathering, or collecting of his wrath is upon evil, that is, upon the wicked;" and the sense is, that while, on the one hand, God, who holds the lightning in his hands, points out to it his friends, so that they are spared; on the other hand the gathering together, or the condensation, of his wrath is upon the evil. That is, the lightnings - so vivid, so mighty, and apparently so wholly beyond law or control, are under his direction, and he makes them the means of executing his pleasure. His friends are spared; and the condensation of his wrath is on his foes. This exposition of the passage accords with the general scope of the remarks of Elihu, and this view of the manner in which God controls even the lightning, was one that was adapted to fill the mind with exalted conceptions of the majesty and power of the Most High. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. noise&#8212;rather, He revealeth it (literally, "announceth concerning it") to His friend (antithesis to adversary, Job 36:32, so the Hebrew is translated, Job 2:11); also to cattle and plants (literally, "that which shooteth up"; Ge 40:10; 41:22). As the genial effect of "water" in the growth of food, is mentioned, Job 36:31, so here that of "light" in cherishing cattle and plants [Umbreit]. If English Version, "noise" be retained, translate, "His noise (thunder) announces concerning Him (His coming in the tempest), the cattle (to announce) concerning Him when He is in the act of rising up" (in the storm). Some animals give various intimations that they are sensible of the approach of a storm [Virgil, Georgics, I.373, &c.].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The noise thereof, </span> to wit. of or within the black or thick cloud, spoken of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-32.htm" title="With clouds he covers the light; and commands it not to shine by the cloud that comes between.">Job 36:32</a></span>.

"If Job had only come," says a Midrash (Jalkut, 518), "to explain to us the matter of the race of the deluge (vid., especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15-18</a>), it had been sufficient; and if Elihu had only come to explain to us the matter of the origin of rain (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1514; &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), it had been enough."
