When we hear any thing said to God's dishonour, we ought to bear our testimony against it. Job had represented God as severe in marking what he did amiss. Elihu urges that he had spoken wrong, and that he ought to humble himself before God, and by repentance to unsay it. God is not accountable to us. It is unreasonable for weak, sinful creatures, to strive with a God of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness. He acts with perfect justice, wisdom, and goodness, where we cannot perceive it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He putteth my feet in the stocks - This also is language which Job had used; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>.

It is man's twofold origin which Elihu, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>, gives utterance to in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> : the mode of man's origin, which is exalted above that of all other earthly beings that have life; for the life of the animal is only the individualizing of the breath of the Divine Spirit already existing in matter. The spirit of man, on the contrary (for which the language has reserved the name &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;), is an inspiration directly coming forth from God the personal being, transferred into the bodily frame, and therefore forming a person.<p>(Note: God took a small piece of His own life - says the tradition among the Karens, a scattered tribe of Eastern India - blew into the nostrils of His son and daughter, and they became living beings, and were really human.)<p>In the exalted consciousness of having been originated by the Spirit of God, and being endowed with life from the inbreathed breath of the Almighty, Elihu stands invincible before Job: if thou canst, refute me (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with acc. of the person, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-32.htm">Job 33:32</a>); array thyself (&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, according to Ges. 63, rem. 1) before me (here with the additional thought of &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>, in a forensic sense with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;), place thyself in position, or take thy post (imper. Hithpa. with the ah less frequent by longer forms, Ew. 228, a).<p>On the other side, he also, like Job, belongs to God, i.e., is dependent and conditioned. &#1492;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is to be written with Segol (not Ssere); &#1500;&#1488;&#1500; is intended like &#1500;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-16.htm">Job 12:16</a>; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1498; signifies properly, according to thine utterance, i.e., standard, in accordance with, i.e., like thee, and is used even in the Pentateuch (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>) in this sense pro ratione; &#1499;&#1508;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18</a>, we took differently. He, Elihu, is also nipped from the clay, i.e., taken from the earth, as when the potter nips off a piece of his clay (comp. Aram. &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, a piece, Arab. qurs, a bread-cake, or a dung-cake, vid., supra, p. 449, from qarasa, to pinch off, take off, cogn. qarada, to gnaw off, cut off, p. 512). Thus, therefore, no terribleness in his appearing will disconcert Job, and his pressure will not be a burden upon him. By a comparison of <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, it might seem that &#1488;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; (lxx &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), but &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; is everywhere connected only with &#1497;&#1491;, never with &#1499;&#1468;&#1507;; and the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. is explained according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>, where &#1488;&#1499;&#1507; signifies to oppress, drive (Jer. compulit), and from the dialects differently, for in Syr. ecaf signifies to be anxious about anything (ecaf li, it causes me anxiety, curae mihi est), and in Arab. accafa, to saddle, uca&#770;f, Talmud. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1507;, a saddle, so that consequently the Targ. translation of &#1488;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; by &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, my burden, and the Syr. by &#1488;&#1493;&#1499;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, my pressing forward (Arabic version iqba&#770;li, my touch), are supported, since &#1488;&#1499;&#1507; signifies pressure, heavy weight, load, and burden; according to which it is also translated by Saad. (my constraint), Gecat. (my might). It is therefore not an opponent who is not on an equality with him by nature, with whom Job has to do. If he is not able to answer him, he will have to be considered as beaten. </body></html>
