This thought will be of great use for our getting good from sickness, in and by which God speaks to men. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet, by the grace of God, the pain of the body is often made a means of good to the soul. When afflictions have done their work, they shall be removed. A ransom or propitiation is found. Jesus Christ is the Messenger and the Ransom, so Elihu calls him, as Job had called him his Redeemer, for he is both the Purchaser and the Price, the Priest and the sacrifice. So high was the value of souls, that nothing less would redeem them; and so great the hurt done by sin, that nothing less would atone for it, than the blood of the Son of God, who gave his life a ransom for many. A blessed change follows. Recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed, when it proceeds from the remission of sin. All that truly repent of their sins, shall find mercy with God. The works of darkness are unfruitful works; all the gains of sin will come far short of the damage. We must, with a broken and contrite heart, confess our sins to God, 1Jo 1:9. We must confess the fact of sin; and not try to justify or excuse ourselves. We must confess the fault of sin; I have perverted that which was right. We must confess the folly of sin; So foolish have I been and ignorant. Is there not good reason why we should make such a confession?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave - That is, he himself does, for the word soul is often used to denote self.<p>And his life to the destroyers -  - &#1500;&#1502;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;  lammitiym. literally, "to those causing death."

But it probably refers to diseases and pangs as having power to terminate life, and being the cause of the close of life. The meaning is, that the afflicted man comes very near to those acute sufferings which terminate life, and which by personification are here represented as the authors of death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. destroyers&#8212;angels of death commissioned by God to end man's life (2Sa 24:16; Ps 78:49).

S. 282f.), as a medium of revelation - a usual form of divine revelation, especially in the heathen world, to which positive revelation is wanting. The reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (Codd., lxx, Syr., Symm., Jer.), as also the accentuation of the &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; with Mehupach Legarme, proceeds from the correct assumption, that vision of the night and dream are not coincident notions; moreover, the detailing <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>, is formed according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>. In this condition of deep or half sleep, revelat aurem hominum, a phrase used of the preparation of the ear for the purpose of hearing by the removal of hindrances, and, in general, of confidential communication, therefore: He opens the ear of men, and seals their admonition, i.e., the admonition that is wholesome and necessary for them. Elihu uses &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468; here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-7.htm">Job 37:7</a> as &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a> : to seal anything (to seal up), comp. Arab. h&#803;&#305;&#770;m, &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, in the sense of infallible attestation and confirmation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>), especially (with Arab. b) of divine revelation or inspiration, distinct in meaning from Arab. chtm, &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, in the proper sense. Elihu means that by such dreams and visions, as rare overpowering facts not to be forgotten, God puts the seal upon the warning directed to them which, sent forth in any other way, would make no such impression. Most ancient versions (also Luther) translate as though it were &#1497;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;). &#1502;&#1505;&#1512; is a secondary form to &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-10.htm">Job 36:10</a>, which occurs only here. Next comes the fuller statement of the object of the admonition or warning delivered in such an impressive manner. According to the text before us, it is to be explained: in order that man may remove (put from himself) mischief from himself (Ges. 133, 3); but this inconvenient change of subject is avoided, if we supply a &#1502; to the second, and read &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1502;&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, as lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (which does not necessarily presuppose the reading &#1502;&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1493;), Targ. ab opere malo; Jer. not so good; ab his quae fecit. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; signifies facinus, an evil deed, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-19.htm">1 Samuel 20:19</a>, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>, evil-doing. The infin. constr. now passes into the v. fin., which would be very liable to misconstruction with different subjects: and in order that He (God) may conceal arrogance from man, i.e., altogether remove from him, unaccustom him to, render him weary of. the sin of pride (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492; from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-29.htm">Job 22:29</a>, according to Ges., Ew., Olsh., for &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;). Here everything in thought and expression is peculiar. Also &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-18.htm">Job 33:18</a> (as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-22.htm">Job 33:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-28.htm">Job 33:28</a>), for &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; rof ,)  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-30.htm">Job 33:30</a>) does not occur elsewhere in the book of Job, and the phrase &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-12.htm">Job 36:12</a> (comp. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-28.htm">Job 33:28</a>) nowhere else in the Old Testament. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; (Arab. sila&#770;h, a weapon of offence, opp. meta&#770;&#8219;, a weapon of defence) is the engine for shooting, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, emmittere, to shoot; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; is equivalent to &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; &#1489;&#1506;&#1491; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; ot tnelaviuqe s, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-8.htm">Joel 2:8</a>, to pass away by (precipitate one's self into) the weapon for shooting. To deliver man from sin, viz., sins of carnal security and imaginary self-importance, and at the same time from an early death, whether natural or violent, this is the disciplinary design which God has in view in connection with this first mode of speaking to him; but there is also a second mode. </body></html>
