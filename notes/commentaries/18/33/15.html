There was not then, that we know of, any Divine revelation in writing, though now it is our principal guide. When God designs men's good, by the convictions and dictates of their own consciences, he opens the heart, as Lydia's, and opens the ears, so that conviction finds or forces its way in. The end and design of these admonitions are to keep men from sin, particularly the sin of pride. While sinners are pursuing evil purposes, and indulging their pride, their souls are hastening to destruction. That which turns men from sin, saves them from hell. What a mercy it is to be under the restraints of an awakened conscience!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In a dream - This was one of the methods by which the will of God was made known in the early periods of the world; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12-17</a>. And for a fuller account of this method of communicating the divine will, see the introduction to Isaiah, Section 7 (2).<p>In a vision of the night - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>; compare the introduction to Isaiah, Section 7 (4).<p>When deep sleep falleth upon men - This may be designed to intimate more distinctly that it was from God. It was not the effect of disturbed and broken rest; not such fancies as come into the mind between sleeping and waking, but the visitations of the divine Spirit in the profoundest repose of the night. The word rendered "deep sleep" (&#1514;&#1512;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;  tarde&#770;ma&#770;h) is one that denotes the most profound repose. It is not merely sleep, but it is sleep of the soundest kind - that kind when we do not usually dream; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>. The Chaldee has here rendered it correctly, &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488; &#1513;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1488; - sleep that is deep. The Septuagint renders it, &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  deinos phobos - dread horror. The Syriac renders this verse, "Not by the lips does he teach; by dreams and visions of the night," etc.<p>In slumberings upon the bed - The word rendered "slumberings" (&#1489;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492;  bitenu&#770;ma&#770;h) means a light sleep, as contradistinguished from very profound repose. Our word slumber conveys the exact idea. The meaning of the whole is, that God speaks to people when their senses are locked in repose - alike in the profound sleep when they do not ordinarily dream, and in the gentle and light slumbers when the sleep is easily broken. In what way, however, they were to distinguish such communications from ordinary dreams, we have no information. It is scarcely necessary to remark that what is here and elsewhere said in the Scriptures about dreams, is no warrant for putting any confidence in them now as if they were revelations from heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. slumberings&#8212;light is opposed to "deep sleep." Elihu has in view Eliphaz (Job 4:13), and also Job himself (Job 7:14).

That is, God speaks to men in this way, and which in those times was his most usual way; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a>; sometimes he spake to a prophet, a person in public office, and made known his mind and will in this manner to him, that he might deliver it to others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>; and sometimes directly and immediately to persons themselves, as he did to Abimelech and Laban, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>; <p>when deep sleep lieth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; the former denotes a fast, heavy, and sound sleep, when the senses are all locked up, and there is not the least attention to any outward object; the latter a slight sleep, when a man is between sleeping and waking; and now at such a time, when he was laid on his bed in the night season, it was usual for God to come to him in a visionary way, and impress things on his mind; when it was called off front worldly and earthly thoughts and cares, and was calm and serene, and so fit to receive what intimations and instructions might be given this way; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-4.htm">Psalm 4:4</a>.

Sometimes men recognized such visions as Divine communications; but sometimes, probably quite as often, they regarded them as mere dreams, fancies, phantasies, unworthy of any attention. Elihu seems to hold that Divine visions came only when deep sleep falleth upon men; and similarly Eliphaz, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>. This method of revelation seems to belong especially to the more primitive times, and the earlier stages of God's dealings with men. In the New Testament dreams scarcely form any part of the economy of grace. <span class="cmt_word">In slumberings upon the bed</span>.
