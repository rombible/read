The spirit of his inner nature constrains him, since, on account of its intensity and the fulness of this interior, it struggles to break through as through a space that is too narrow for it. &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>, not from the curved appearance of the belly, but from the interior of the body with its organs, which serve the spirit life as the strings of a harp; comp. Arab. batn, the middle or interior; ba&#770;tin, inwardly (opposite of za&#770;hir, outwardly). His interior is like wine &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, which, or (as an adverbial dependent clause) when it is not opened, i.e., is kept closed, so that the accumulated gas has no vent, lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (bound up), Jer. absque spiraculo; it will burst like new bottles. &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506; is not a relative clause referring distributively to each single one of these bottles (Hirz. and others), and not an adverbial subordinate clause (Hahn: when it will explode), but predicate to &#1489;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497;: his interior is near bursting like new bottles (&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; masc. like &#1504;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-13.htm">Joshua 9:13</a>), i.e., not such as are themselves new (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>, for these do not burst so easily), but like bottles of new wine, which has to undergo the action of fermentation, lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; (Cod.

Since he will now yield to his irresistible impulse, in order that he may obtain air or free space, i.e., disburdening and ease (&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;), he intends to accept no man's person, i.e., to show partiality to no one (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-8.htm">Job 13:8</a>), and he will flatter no one. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; signifies in all three dialects to call any one by an honourable name, to give a surname, here with &#1488;&#1500;, to speak fine words to any one, to flatter him. This Elihu is determined he will not do; for &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, I know not how to flatter (French, je ne sais point flatter), for &#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1500;&#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;; comp. the similar constructions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3</a> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-6.htm">Esther 8:6</a>), <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-16.htm">Job 10:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-21.htm">Isaiah 42:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>, Ges. 142, 3, c; also in Arabic similar verbs, as "to be able" and "to prepare one's self," are thus connected with the fut. without a particle between (e.g., anshaa jef&#8219;alu, he began to act). Without partiality he will speak, flattery is not his force. If by flattery he should deny the truth, his Maker would quickly carry him off. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; followed by subjunct. fut.: for a little (with disjunctive accent, because equivalent to haud multum abest quin), i.e., very soon indeed, or easily would or might ... ; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1504;&#1497; (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>) seems designedly to harmonize with &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1497;. </body></html>
