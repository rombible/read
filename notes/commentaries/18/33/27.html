This thought will be of great use for our getting good from sickness, in and by which God speaks to men. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet, by the grace of God, the pain of the body is often made a means of good to the soul. When afflictions have done their work, they shall be removed. A ransom or propitiation is found. Jesus Christ is the Messenger and the Ransom, so Elihu calls him, as Job had called him his Redeemer, for he is both the Purchaser and the Price, the Priest and the sacrifice. So high was the value of souls, that nothing less would redeem them; and so great the hurt done by sin, that nothing less would atone for it, than the blood of the Son of God, who gave his life a ransom for many. A blessed change follows. Recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed, when it proceeds from the remission of sin. All that truly repent of their sins, shall find mercy with God. The works of darkness are unfruitful works; all the gains of sin will come far short of the damage. We must, with a broken and contrite heart, confess our sins to God, 1Jo 1:9. We must confess the fact of sin; and not try to justify or excuse ourselves. We must confess the fault of sin; I have perverted that which was right. We must confess the folly of sin; So foolish have I been and ignorant. Is there not good reason why we should make such a confession?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He looketh upon men - Margin, "or, he shall look upon men, and say, I have sinned." Umbreit renders this, Nun singt er jubelnd zu den Menschen - "now he sings joyfully among men." So Noyes, "He shall sing among men, and say." Prof. Lee "He shall fully consider or pronounce right to men, so that one shall say, I have sinned." Coverdale, "Such a respect hath he unto men. Therefore let a man confess and say, I have offended." The Septuagint renders it, &#x395;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;  Eita tote apomempsetai anthro&#772;pos autos heauto&#772;, "then shall a man blame himself," etc. These various renderings arise from the difference of signification attached to the Hebrew word &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  ya&#772;shor. According to our interpretation, it is derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;  sh&#305;&#770;yr, "to sing," and then the meaning would be, "he sings before men," and thus the reference would be to the sufferer, meaning that he would have occasion to rejoice among men. See Gesenius on the word. According to the other view, the word is derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;  shu&#770;r, "to look round"; "to care for, or regard"; and according to this, the reference is to God, meaning that he carefully and attentively observes people in such circumstances, and, if he sees evidence that there is true penitence, he has compassion and saves. This idea certainly accords better with the scope of the passage than the former, and it seems to me is to be regarded as correct.<p>And if any say, I have sinned - Hebrew "And says," that is, if the sufferer, under the pressure of his afflictions, is willing to confess his faults, then God is ready to show him mercy. This accords with what Elihu purposed to state of the design of afflictions, that they were intended to bring people to reflection, and to be a means of wholesome discipline. There is no doubt that he meant that all this should be understood by Job as applicable to himself, for he manifestly means to be understood as saying that he had not seen in him the evidence of a penitent mind, such as he supposed afflictions were designed to produce.<p>And perverted that which was right - That is, in regard to operations and views of the divine government. He had held error, or had cherished wrong apprehensions of the divine character. Or it may mean, that he had dealt unjustly with people in his contact with them.<p>And it profited me not - The word used here (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;  sha&#770;va&#770;h) means properly to be even or level; then to be equal, or of like value; and here may mean, that he now saw that it was no advantage to him to have done wickedly, since it brought upon him such a punishment, or the benefit which he received from his life of wickedness was no equivalent for the pain which he had been called to suffer in consequence of it. This is the common interpretation. Rosenmuller, however, suggests another, which is, that he designs by this language to express his sense of the divine mercy, and that it means "my afflictions are in no sense equal to my deserts. I have not been punished as I might justly have been, for God has interposed to spare me." It seems to me, however, that the former interpretation accords best with the meaning of the words and the scope of the passage. It would then be the reflection of a man on the bed of suffering, that the course of life which brought him there had been attended with no advantage, but had been the means of plunging him into deserved sorrows. from which he could be rescued only by the grace of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. he looketh&#8212;God.

According to our version, and other interpreters, the sense is, God looks upon men as he does on all men in general, their ways and their works; and particularly he takes notice of men under affliction, and observes how they behave; if they are penitent and confess their sins, he restores them to health, and does them good both in body and soul. But most carry the sense another way, and interpret it of the sick man recovered, who looks upon his friends and relations about him, and any others that come within his reach; of he goes about them, as Aben Ezra explains the word; or will accompany with men, as Mr. Broughton; or sets them in rows, as Gersom, in order, as at a levee, that he may the better address them; or he shall direct himself to them, as the Targum; or shall sing over them or before them, so Schultens (t); in a joyful manner, in an exulting strain, express himself, as follows; for the phrase, <p>and if any say (u), should be rendered, "and he shall say"; make the following confession of his acknowledgment of the goodness of God unto him; <p>I have sinned; against God and man, and that has been the cause of all my afflictions; I am now sensible of it, and ingenuously own it: <p>and perverted that which was right: have not done that which is right in the sight of God, nor what is just and right between man and man; have perverted the right ways of God, swerved from his commandments, and gone into crooked paths, with the workers of iniquity; and declined from, or perverted, justice and judgment among men; <p>and it profiteth me not; as sin does not in the issue; though it promises profit and advantage, it does not yield it; but, on the contrary, much harm and mischief come by it. <p>(t)  "cantabit super vel coram", Schultens.

Aboda zara 42a: If a heathen have broken an idol to pieces (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;) to derive advantage from the pieces, both the (shattered) idol and the fragments (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1497;&#1503;) are permitted (since both are deprived of their heathenish character).)<p>signifies conterere, comminuere; Abulwald (in Ges. Thes.) interprets it here by suhifet wa-baradet, they are consumed and wasted away, and explains it by &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;. The radical notion is that of scraping, scratching, rubbing away (not to be interchanged with Arab. sf', &#1505;&#1508;&#1492;, which, starting from the radical notion of sweeping away, vanishing, comes to have that of wasting away; cognate, however, with the above Arab. sh&#803;f, whence suha&#770;f, consumption, prop. a rasure of the plumpness of the body). According to the Keri, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a> runs: and his bones (limbs) are shattered (fallen away), they are not seen, i.e., in their wasting away and shrivelling up they have lost their former pleasing form. Others, taking the bones in their strict sense, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1492; in the signification to scrape away  equals  lay bare, take &#1500;&#1488; &#1512;&#1488;&#1493; as a relative clause, as Jer. has done: ossa quae tecta fuerant nudabuntur (rather nudata sunt), but this ought with a change of mood to be &#1500;&#1488; &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;...&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. To the former interpretation corresponds the unexceptionable Chethib: and the falling away of his limbs are not seen, i.e., (per attractionem) his wasting limbs are diminished until they are become invisible. &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is one of the four Old Testament words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-26.htm">Genesis 43:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-18.htm">Ezra 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm">Leviticus 23:17</a>) which have a Dagesh in the Aleph; in all four the Aleph stands between two vowels, and the dageshing (probably the remains of a custom in the system of pointing which has become the prevailing one, which, with these few exceptions, has been suffered to fall away) is intended to indicate that the Aleph is here to be carefully pronounced as a guttural (to use an Arabic expression, as Hamza), therefore in this passage ru-'u&#770;.<p>(Note: Vid., Luzzatto's Grammatica della Lingua Ebraica (1853), 54. Ewald's (21) view, that in these instances the pointed Aleph is to be read as j (therefore ruju), is unfounded; moreover, the point over the Aleph is certainly only improperly called Dagesh, it might at least just as suitably be called Mappik.)<p>Thus, then, the soul (the bearer of the life of the body) of the sick man, at last succumbing to this process of decay, comes near to the pit, and his life to the &#1502;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, destroying angels (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>), i.e., the angels who are commissioned by God to slay the man, if he does not anticipate the decree of death by penitence. To understand the powers of death in general, with Rosenm., or the pains of death, with Schlottm. and others, does not commend itself, because the Elihu section has a strong angelological colouring in common with the book of Job. The following strophe, indeed, in contrast to the &#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, speaks of an angel that effects deliverance from death. </body></html>
