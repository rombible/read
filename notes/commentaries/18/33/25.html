This thought will be of great use for our getting good from sickness, in and by which God speaks to men. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet, by the grace of God, the pain of the body is often made a means of good to the soul. When afflictions have done their work, they shall be removed. A ransom or propitiation is found. Jesus Christ is the Messenger and the Ransom, so Elihu calls him, as Job had called him his Redeemer, for he is both the Purchaser and the Price, the Priest and the sacrifice. So high was the value of souls, that nothing less would redeem them; and so great the hurt done by sin, that nothing less would atone for it, than the blood of the Son of God, who gave his life a ransom for many. A blessed change follows. Recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed, when it proceeds from the remission of sin. All that truly repent of their sins, shall find mercy with God. The works of darkness are unfruitful works; all the gains of sin will come far short of the damage. We must, with a broken and contrite heart, confess our sins to God, 1Jo 1:9. We must confess the fact of sin; and not try to justify or excuse ourselves. We must confess the fault of sin; I have perverted that which was right. We must confess the folly of sin; So foolish have I been and ignorant. Is there not good reason why we should make such a confession?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His flesh shall be fresher than a child's - Margin, "childhood." The meaning is obvious. He would be restored again to health. The calamity which had been brought upon him for purposes of discipline, would be removed. This was the theory of Elihu in regard to afflictions, and he undoubtedly meant that it should be applied to Job. If he would now, understanding the nature and design of affliction, turn to God, he would be recovered again, and enjoy the health and rigor of his youth. We are not to suppose that this is universally true, though it is undoubtedly often a fact now, that if those who are afflicted become truly penitent, and call upon God, the affliction will be removed. It will have accomplished its object, and may be withdrawn. Hence, they who pray that their afflictions may be withdrawn, should first pray that they may accomplish on their own hearts the effect which God designs, producing in them penitence, deadness to the world, and humiliation, and then that his hand may be withdrawn.<p>He shall return to the days of his youth - That is, to health and rigor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25-28.

Being recovered from illness and restored to health, through the gracious dealings of God with him. This is to be understood not simply and absolutely, but comparatively, or with respect to his former condition; that he, who before was reduced to skin and bone, is now become fat and plump; and whose flesh was dry and withered, now moist, succulent, and juicy; and whose skin was wrinkled, now soft and smooth, and sleek; and whose face was pale, now bloomy and ruddy. The Targum is, <p>"his flesh is weakened more than a child,'' <p>and the Vulgate Latin, <p>"is consumed,'' <p>referring to his former state: <p>he shall return to the days of his youth. His youth renewed, and he seem young again; become hale and robust as in his youthful days; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">His flesh shall be <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</span><p>(q) He will feel God's favour and rejoice; declaring by this in which stands the true joy of the faithful, and that God will restore him to health, which is a token of his blessing.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>.

Thus is the Keri &#1493;&#1512;&#1489; to be understood, for the interpretation: and the multitude of his limbs with unceasing pain (Arnh. after Aben-Ezra), is unnatural. But the Chethib is far more commendable: and with a constant tumult of his limbs (Hirz. and others). <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19</a> might also be taken as a substantival clause: and the tumult of his limbs is unceasing (Umbr., Welte); but that taking over of &#1489;&#1468; from &#1489;&#1502;&#1499;&#1488;&#1493;&#1489; is simpler and more pleasing. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; (opposite of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>) is an excellent description of disease which consists in a disturbance of the equilibrium of the powers, in the dissolution of their harmony, in the excitement of one against another (Psychol. S. 287). &#1488;&#1514;&#1503; for &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; belongs to the many defective forms of writing of this section. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-20.htm">Job 33:20</a> we again meet a Hebraeo-Arabic hapaxlegomenon. &#1494;&#1492;&#1501; from &#1494;&#1492;&#1501;. In Arab. zahuma signifies to stink, like the Aram. &#1494;&#1492;&#1501; (whence &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, dirt and stench), zahama to thrust back, restrain, after which Abu Suleiman Dad Alfsi, in his Arabic Lexicon of the Hebrew, interprets: "his soul thrusts back (&#1514;&#1494;&#1492;&#1501; &#1504;&#1508;&#1505;&#1492;) food and every means of life," <p>(Note: Vid., Pinsker's Likkute Kadmoniot, p. &#1511;&#1502;&#1490;.)<p>beside which the suff. of &#1493;&#1494;&#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is taken as an anticipation of the following object (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>): his life feels disgust at it, at bread, and his soul at dainty meat. The Piel has then only the intensive signification of Kal (synon. &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-18.htm">Psalm 107:18</a>), according to which it is translated by Hahn with many before him. But if the poet had wished to be so understood, he would have made use of a less ambiguous arrangement of the words, &#1493;&#1494;&#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;. We take &#1494;&#1492;&#1501; with Ew. 122, b, as causative of Kal, in which signification the Piel, it is true, occurs but rarely, yet it does sometimes, instead of Hiph.; but without translating, with Hirz., &#1495;&#1497;&#1492; by hunger and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; by appetite, which gives a confused thought. Schlottm. appropriately remarks: "It is very clearly expressed, as the proper vital power, the proper &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;, when it is inwardly consumed by disease, gives one a loathing for that which it otherwise likes as being a necessary condition of its own existence." Thus it is: health produces an appetite, sickness causes nausea; the soul that is in an uninjured normal state longs for food, that which is severely weakened by sickness turns the desire for dainties into loathing and aversion.</body></html>
