This thought will be of great use for our getting good from sickness, in and by which God speaks to men. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet, by the grace of God, the pain of the body is often made a means of good to the soul. When afflictions have done their work, they shall be removed. A ransom or propitiation is found. Jesus Christ is the Messenger and the Ransom, so Elihu calls him, as Job had called him his Redeemer, for he is both the Purchaser and the Price, the Priest and the sacrifice. So high was the value of souls, that nothing less would redeem them; and so great the hurt done by sin, that nothing less would atone for it, than the blood of the Son of God, who gave his life a ransom for many. A blessed change follows. Recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed, when it proceeds from the remission of sin. All that truly repent of their sins, shall find mercy with God. The works of darkness are unfruitful works; all the gains of sin will come far short of the damage. We must, with a broken and contrite heart, confess our sins to God, 1Jo 1:9. We must confess the fact of sin; and not try to justify or excuse ourselves. We must confess the fault of sin; I have perverted that which was right. We must confess the folly of sin; So foolish have I been and ignorant. Is there not good reason why we should make such a confession?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So that his life abhorreth bread - It is a common effect of sickness to take away the appetite. Elihu here regards it as a part of the wholesome discipline of the sufferer. He has no relish for the comforts of life.<p>And his soul dainty meat - Margin, "meat of desire." The Hebrew is, "food of desire." The word rendered "meat" (&#1502;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;  ma'a&#774;ka&#770;l) does not denote animal food only, but any kind of food. So the Old English word meat was used. The idea is, that the sick man loathes the most delicate food. It is a part of his discipline that the pleasure which he had in the days of his health is now taken away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. life&#8212;that is, the appetite, which ordinarily sustains "life" (Job 38:39; Ps 107:18; Ec 12:5). The taking away of desire for food by sickness symbolizes the removal by affliction of lust, for things which foster the spiritual fever of pride.<p>soul&#8212;desire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His life, </span> i.e. his soul, as the next clause explains it; or his appetite, which is a sign and an act of life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Bread, </span> i.e. common and necessary food. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dainty meat; </span> such as others do, and he formerly did, much desire and prize. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So that his life abhorreth bread,.... Through the force of pain he loses his appetite for food, and even a nausea of it takes place; he loathes it as the most abominable and filthy thing that can be thought of; even bread, so necessary to the support of human life, so strengthening to the heart of man, and what he every day stands in need of, and should pray for, and in health is never weary of; it may be put for all common and useful food: <p>and his soul dainty meat; the most rich and delicious; such as the tables of the great and rich are furnished with: "food of desire" (p); or desirable food, as it may be rendered; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>; such as in the time of health the appetite craves and desires, and is fed on with delight and pleasure, but now had in the utmost aversion.

He has longed for God's answer to these questions; and because God has veiled Himself in silence, he has fallen into complain against Him, as a ruler who governs according to His own sovereign arbitrary will. This is what Elihu has before his mind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-13.htm">Job 33:13</a>. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; (elsewhere in the book of Job with &#1506;&#1501; or the acc. of the person with whom one contends) is here, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a> and freq., joined with &#1488;&#1500; and conjugated as a contracted Hiph. (&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; instead of &#1512;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;, Ges. 73, 1); and &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; with the acc. signifies here: to answer anything (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-3.htm">Job 9:3</a>); the suff. does not refer back to &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; of the preceding strophe (Hirz., Hahn), but to God. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; are the things, i.e., facts and circumstances of His rule; all those things which are mysterious in it He answers not, i.e., He answers concerning nothing in this respect (comp. &#1499;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-27.htm">Job 34:27</a>), He gives no kind of account of them (Schnurr., Ges., and others). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14</a>, in the sense of imo, is attached to this negative thought, which has become a ground of contention for Job: yet no, God does really speak with men, although not as Job desires when challenged and in His own defence. Many expositors take &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; after lxx, Syr., and Jer., in the signification semel, secundo (thus also Hahn, Schlottm.); but semel is &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, whereas &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is nowhere equivalent to &#1489;&#1508;&#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-4.htm">Numbers 10:4</a> it signifies with one, viz., trumpet; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-18.htm">Proverbs 28:18</a>, on one, viz., of the many ways; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-8.htm">Jeremiah 10:8</a>, in one, i.e., in like folly (not: altogether, at once, which &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, Syr. bachdo, signifies); then further on it is not twice, but two different modes or means of divine attestation, viz., dreams and sicknesses, that are spoken of; wherefore it is rightly translated by the Targ. una loquela, by Pagn. uno modo, by Vatabl., Merc., una via. The form of the declaration: by one - by two, is that of the so-called number-proverbs, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>. In diverse ways or by different means God speaks to mortal man - he does not believe it, it is his own fault if he does perceive it. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, which is correctly denoted as a separate clause by Rebia mugrasch, is neither with Schlottm. to be regarded as a circumstantial clause (without one's ... ), nor with Vatablus and Hahn as a conditional clause (if one does not attend to it), nor with Montanus and Piscator as a relative clause (to him who does not observe it), but with Tremellius as a co-ordinate second predicative clause without a particle (one might expect &#1488;&#1498;): he (mortal man) or one observes it not (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; with neut. suff. exactly like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-13.htm">Job 35:13</a>).</body></html>
