This thought will be of great use for our getting good from sickness, in and by which God speaks to men. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet, by the grace of God, the pain of the body is often made a means of good to the soul. When afflictions have done their work, they shall be removed. A ransom or propitiation is found. Jesus Christ is the Messenger and the Ransom, so Elihu calls him, as Job had called him his Redeemer, for he is both the Purchaser and the Price, the Priest and the sacrifice. So high was the value of souls, that nothing less would redeem them; and so great the hurt done by sin, that nothing less would atone for it, than the blood of the Son of God, who gave his life a ransom for many. A blessed change follows. Recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed, when it proceeds from the remission of sin. All that truly repent of their sins, shall find mercy with God. The works of darkness are unfruitful works; all the gains of sin will come far short of the damage. We must, with a broken and contrite heart, confess our sins to God, 1Jo 1:9. We must confess the fact of sin; and not try to justify or excuse ourselves. We must confess the fault of sin; I have perverted that which was right. We must confess the folly of sin; So foolish have I been and ignorant. Is there not good reason why we should make such a confession?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He is chastened also with pain - As another means of checking and restraining him from the commission of sin. When the warnings of the night fail, and when he is bent on a life of sin, then God lays him on a bed of pain, and he is brought to reflection there. There he has an opportunity to think of his life, and of all the consequences which must follow from a career of iniquity. This involves the main inquiry before the disputants. It was, why people were afflicted. The three friends of Job had said that it was a full proof of wickedness, and that when the professedly pious were afflicted it was demonstrative of insincerity and hypocrisy. Job had called this position in question, and proved that it could not be so, but still was at a loss why it was. Elihu now says, that affliction is a part of a disciplinary government; that it is one of the means which God adopts, when warnings are ineffectual, to restrain people and to bring them to reflection and repentance. This appears to have been a view which was almost entirely new to them.<p>And the multitude of his bones with strong pain - The bones, as has before been remarked, it was supposed might be the seat of the acutest pain; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-11.htm">Job 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-30.htm">Job 30:30</a>. The meaning here is, that the frame was racked with intense suffering in order to admonish men of sin, to save them from plunging into deeper transgression, and to bring them to repentance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. When man does not heed warnings of the night, he is chastened, &c. The new thought suggested by Elihu is that affliction is disciplinary (Job 36:10); for the good of the godly.<p>multitude&#8212;so the Margin, Hebrew (Keri).

This seems to be another way, in which God, according to his eternal purposes, speaks unto men, as the word "also" intimates; namely, by afflictions, and sometimes painful ones; which have a voice in them, and men of wisdom will hearken to it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>. Pain here signifies not pain of the mind, or a wounded spirit, which is very afflicting, distressing, and intolerable; but pain of the body, as the next clause shows; and this endured on the bed, it being so great as to confine a man to his bed, or is what he felt there, where he might hope for ease and rest; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-13.htm">Job 7:13</a>; <p>and the multitude of his bones with strong pain; not with a slight one, but a very strong one, such as those felt who gnawed their tongues for pain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>. Jarchi interprets it, the multitude of his bones, which are strong; though they are hardy and strong, yet filled with exquisite pain; and not one, or a few of them, but a multitude of them, as there are a multitude of them in a man's body; even all of them, as Hezekiah complains, which must be very excruciating indeed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; and which was Job's case; not only his flesh was in pain, through the sores and ulcers upon him, but his bones were pierced in him, and his sinews had no rest, and he was full of tossings to and fro, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>; and in this way he was, as other good men are, reproved and chastened by the Lord; and in which way he had spoke to him, as he does to others, and which should be attended to; and since such painful afflictions are but fatherly chastisements, they should be patiently endured, and the voice of God in them listened to, and before long there will be no more pain: the "Cetib", or textual writing, is, "the contention of his bones is strong"; through pain, or with which God contends with men; we follow the marginal reading. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">multitude of his Bones with strong pain</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">and with a continual strife In his bones</span>—the word “strife” meaning “conflict of pain.” This is the reading of the Heb. text.

God also speaks to men, secretly and silently, in another way, viz. through chastisements.

He has longed for God's answer to these questions; and because God has veiled Himself in silence, he has fallen into complain against Him, as a ruler who governs according to His own sovereign arbitrary will. This is what Elihu has before his mind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-13.htm">Job 33:13</a>. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; (elsewhere in the book of Job with &#1506;&#1501; or the acc. of the person with whom one contends) is here, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a> and freq., joined with &#1488;&#1500; and conjugated as a contracted Hiph. (&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; instead of &#1512;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;, Ges. 73, 1); and &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; with the acc. signifies here: to answer anything (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-3.htm">Job 9:3</a>); the suff. does not refer back to &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; of the preceding strophe (Hirz., Hahn), but to God. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; are the things, i.e., facts and circumstances of His rule; all those things which are mysterious in it He answers not, i.e., He answers concerning nothing in this respect (comp. &#1499;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-27.htm">Job 34:27</a>), He gives no kind of account of them (Schnurr., Ges., and others). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14</a>, in the sense of imo, is attached to this negative thought, which has become a ground of contention for Job: yet no, God does really speak with men, although not as Job desires when challenged and in His own defence. Many expositors take &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; after lxx, Syr., and Jer., in the signification semel, secundo (thus also Hahn, Schlottm.); but semel is &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, whereas &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is nowhere equivalent to &#1489;&#1508;&#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-4.htm">Numbers 10:4</a> it signifies with one, viz., trumpet; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-18.htm">Proverbs 28:18</a>, on one, viz., of the many ways; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-8.htm">Jeremiah 10:8</a>, in one, i.e., in like folly (not: altogether, at once, which &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, Syr. bachdo, signifies); then further on it is not twice, but two different modes or means of divine attestation, viz., dreams and sicknesses, that are spoken of; wherefore it is rightly translated by the Targ. una loquela, by Pagn. uno modo, by Vatabl., Merc., una via. The form of the declaration: by one - by two, is that of the so-called number-proverbs, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>.
