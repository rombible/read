When we hear any thing said to God's dishonour, we ought to bear our testimony against it. Job had represented God as severe in marking what he did amiss. Elihu urges that he had spoken wrong, and that he ought to humble himself before God, and by repentance to unsay it. God is not accountable to us. It is unreasonable for weak, sinful creatures, to strive with a God of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness. He acts with perfect justice, wisdom, and goodness, where we cannot perceive it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, he findeth occasions against me - That is, God. This is not exactly the language of Job, though much that he had said had seemed to imply this. The idea is, that God sought opportunity to oppose him; that he was desirous to find in him some ground or reason for punishing him; that he wished to be hostile to him, and was narrowly on the watch to find an opportunity which would justify his bringing calamity upon him. The word rendered "occasions" - &#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;  tenu&#770;'a&#770;h, is from &#1504;&#1493;&#1488;  nu&#770;', in the Hiphil, &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;  ha&#772;niy' - to refuse, decline; to hinder, restrain, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-6.htm">Numbers 30:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-9.htm">Numbers 30:9</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-12.htm">Numbers 30:12</a>; and hence, the noun means, a holding back, a withdrawal, an alienation; and hence, the idea is, that God sought to be alienated from Job. The Vulgate renders it, "He seeks complaints (querales) against me." The Septuagint, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  mempsin - accusation. Umbreit, Feindshaft, enmity. So Gesenius and Noyes. "He counteth me for his enemy." This is language which Job had used; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. occasions&#8212;for hostility; literally, "enmities" (Job 13:24; 16:9; 19:11; 30:21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He picketh quarrels with me, and <span class="ital">watcheth over</span> and <span class="ital">searcheth after</span> all my errors and frailties, as Job said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-6.htm" title="That you enquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?">Job 10:6</a> 14:16,17</span>; severely marking what is amiss in me, that thence he may take occasion to punish me worse than mine iniquities deserve.

That is, sought in order to find them; so Job in some places suggests, that God inquired after his sins, and sought diligently after them, that he might have something to bring against him; and because he could not find great sins, gross enormities, he sought after lesser sins; so some render the word, "staggerings", "totterings" (h); frailties, failings, and infirmities; and because he could find none of late of a very heinous nature, he went back as far as the sins of his youth; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-6.htm">Job 10:6</a>; and this in order to pick a quarrel with him; and so Mr. Broughton renders the words, "lo, he picketh quarrels against me"; or that he might have just reason to depart from him, or to break from him, or to break off friendship with him, or to break him to pieces in his estate, family, and health; all which senses some observe the words will bear: but it would be needless for God to seek in order to find occasions against men; there is enough ready at hand, the sins that are about them; and to represent the Lord as dealing thus with good men is to represent him as acting contrary to the declarations and methods of his grace; yea, as doing what wicked men do to good men, as the enemies of David, Daniel, and Jeremiah, did to them; nay, even as Satan himself does, who goes about and seeks for, and picks up accusations against the saints; this must be owned to be a very irreverent and unbecoming expression of Job's, and for which he deserved to be sharply rebuked, as well as for some following ones, and for which he afterwards was thoroughly humbled: <p>he counteth me for his enemy; this he had often said, but very wrongly; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-24.htm">Job 13:24</a>, and See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>, and See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11</a>. <p>(h) "vacillationes", Cocceius; "aut mutationes", Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

Certainly, Job had <span class="accented">said</span> this more than ones (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19.htm">Job 19</a>. l 1). But he cannot really have believed it, or his trust in God must have failed. The fact that to the last he clung to God, appealed to him, hoped to receive judgment from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-2.htm">Job 31:2, 6, 28, 35-37</a>), is proof sufficient that he knew God was not really alienated from him, but would in the end acknowledge him and vindicate his character. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  4  The Spirit of God hath made me,<p>And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.<p>  5  If thou canst, answer me,<p>Prepare in my presence, take thy stand!<p>  6  Behold, I am like thyself, of God,<p>Formed out of clay am Ialso.<p>  7  Behold, my terror shall not affright thee,<p>And my pressure shall not be heavy upon thee.<p>He has both in common with Job: the spirituality as well as the earthliness of man's nature; but by virtue of the former he does not, indeed, feel himself exalted above Job's person, but above the present standpoint taken up by Job; and in consideration of this, Job need not fear any unequal contest, nor as before God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, in order that he may be able to defend himself against Him, make it a stipulation that His majesty may not terrify him. It is man's twofold origin which Elihu, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>, gives utterance to in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> : the mode of man's origin, which is exalted above that of all other earthly beings that have life; for the life of the animal is only the individualizing of the breath of the Divine Spirit already existing in matter. The spirit of man, on the contrary (for which the language has reserved the name &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;), is an inspiration directly coming forth from God the personal being, transferred into the bodily frame, and therefore forming a person.<p>(Note: God took a small piece of His own life - says the tradition among the Karens, a scattered tribe of Eastern India - blew into the nostrils of His son and daughter, and they became living beings, and were really human.)<p>In the exalted consciousness of having been originated by the Spirit of God, and being endowed with life from the inbreathed breath of the Almighty, Elihu stands invincible before Job: if thou canst, refute me (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with acc. of the person, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-32.htm">Job 33:32</a>); array thyself (&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, according to Ges. 63, rem. 1) before me (here with the additional thought of &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>, in a forensic sense with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;), place thyself in position, or take thy post (imper. Hithpa. with the ah less frequent by longer forms, Ew. 228, a).<p>On the other side, he also, like Job, belongs to God, i.e., is dependent and conditioned. &#1492;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is to be written with Segol (not Ssere); &#1500;&#1488;&#1500; is intended like &#1500;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-16.htm">Job 12:16</a>; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1498; signifies properly, according to thine utterance, i.e., standard, in accordance with, i.e., like thee, and is used even in the Pentateuch (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>) in this sense pro ratione; &#1499;&#1508;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18</a>, we took differently. He, Elihu, is also nipped from the clay, i.e., taken from the earth, as when the potter nips off a piece of his clay (comp. Aram. &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, a piece, Arab. qurs, a bread-cake, or a dung-cake, vid., supra, p. 449, from qarasa, to pinch off, take off, cogn. qarada, to gnaw off, cut off, p. 512). Thus, therefore, no terribleness in his appearing will disconcert Job, and his pressure will not be a burden upon him. By a comparison of <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, it might seem that &#1488;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; (lxx &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), but &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; is everywhere connected only with &#1497;&#1491;, never with &#1499;&#1468;&#1507;; and the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. is explained according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>, where &#1488;&#1499;&#1507; signifies to oppress, drive (Jer. compulit), and from the dialects differently, for in Syr. ecaf signifies to be anxious about anything (ecaf li, it causes me anxiety, curae mihi est), and in Arab. accafa, to saddle, uca&#770;f, Talmud. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1507;, a saddle, so that consequently the Targ. translation of &#1488;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; by &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, my burden, and the Syr. by &#1488;&#1493;&#1499;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, my pressing forward (Arabic version iqba&#770;li, my touch), are supported, since &#1488;&#1499;&#1507; signifies pressure, heavy weight, load, and burden; according to which it is also translated by Saad. (my constraint), Gecat. (my might). It is therefore not an opponent who is not on an equality with him by nature, with whom Job has to do. If he is not able to answer him, he will have to be considered as beaten. </body></html>
