But as, in general, he comes to men by his messengers or ministers, and as their instructions and encouragements are deduced from his mediation, and are made effectual by his gracious presence, it does not much signify whether we interpret the passage of the messengers of God pointing to the Saviour, or the Saviour revealing himself by their ministry. It is equally immaterial whether the words, <span class="ital">Deliver him from going down to the pit, </span>be considered as the language of Christ’s intercession, pleading the <span class="ital">ransom </span>of his blood in behalf of the sinner, or the words of the Father, accepting of his plea and giving command to save the sinner, satisfied with that appointed <span class="ital">ransom: </span>for it cannot reasonably be doubted but that Elihu had reference to it; though he might also intend the sacrifices which prefigured the great atonement.” — Scott. Add to this, that it may serve as no small confirmation of our faith in the doctrines of the gospel, that we find the substance, or great outlines of them thus pointed out to men, by divine revelation, in the earliest ages of the world. Some thousands of years have certainly passed since the book of Job was written, and yet we here find the same great truths declared in relation to man and his salvation through Christ, which are so fully revealed in the New Testament.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:19-28 Job complained of his diseases, and judged by them that God was angry with him; his friends did so too: but Elihu shows that God often afflicts the body for good to the soul. This thought will be of great use for our getting good from sickness, in and by which God speaks to men. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet, by the grace of God, the pain of the body is often made a means of good to the soul. When afflictions have done their work, they shall be removed. A ransom or propitiation is found. Jesus Christ is the Messenger and the Ransom, so Elihu calls him, as Job had called him his Redeemer, for he is both the Purchaser and the Price, the Priest and the sacrifice. So high was the value of souls, that nothing less would redeem them; and so great the hurt done by sin, that nothing less would atone for it, than the blood of the Son of God, who gave his life a ransom for many. A blessed change follows. Recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed, when it proceeds from the remission of sin. All that truly repent of their sins, shall find mercy with God. The works of darkness are unfruitful works; all the gains of sin will come far short of the damage. We must, with a broken and contrite heart, confess our sins to God, 1Jo 1:9. We must confess the fact of sin; and not try to justify or excuse ourselves. We must confess the fault of sin; I have perverted that which was right. We must confess the folly of sin; So foolish have I been and ignorant. Is there not good reason why we should make such a confession?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If there be a messenger with him - This part of the speech of Elihu has given rise to scarcely less diversity of opinion, and to scarcely less discussion, than the celebrated passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a>. Almost every interpreter has had a special view of its meaning, and of course it is very difficult, if not impossible, to determine its true sense. Before the opinions which have been entertained are specified, and an attempt made to determine the true sense of the passage, it may be of interest to see how it is presented in the ancient versions, and what light they throw on it. The Vulgate renders it, "If there is for him an angel speaking, one of thousands, that he may announce the righteousness of the man; he will pity him, and say, Deliver him that he descends not into corruption: I have found him in whom I will be propitious to him" - inveni in quo ei propitier. The Septuagint translators render it, "If there be a thousand angels of death (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  angeloi thanate&#772;foroi), not one of them can mortally wound him (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;  tro&#772;se&#772; auton). If he determine in his heart to turn to the Lord, when he shall have shown man his charge against him, and shown his folly, he will support him that he may not fall to death, and renew his body, like plastering on a wall (&#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  ho&#772;sper aloife&#772;n epi toichou), and will fill his bones with marrow, and make his flesh soft like an infant." The Chaldee renders it, "If there is merit &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488;  z-k-w-t-' in him, an angel is prepared, a comforter (&#1508;&#1512;&#1511;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1488;, Paraclete, Gr. &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  parakle&#772;tos), one among a thousand accusers (&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;, Gr. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  kate&#772;goros), that he may announce to man his rectitude. And he spares him, and says, Redeem him, that he may not descend to corruption; I have found a ransom." Schultens has divided the opinions which have been entertained of the passage into three classes. They are,<p>I. The opinions of those who suppose that by the messenger, or angel, here, there is reference to a man. Of those who hold this opinion, he enumerates no less than seven classes. They are such as these:<p>(1) those who hold that the man referred to is some distinguished instructor sent to the sick to teach them the will of God, an opinion held by Munster and Isidorus;<p>(2) those who refer it to a prophet, as Junius et Tremillius:<p>(3) Codurcus supposes that there is reference to the case of Abimelech, who was made sick on account of Sarah, and that the man referred to was a prophet, who announced to him that God was righteous; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a>.<p>The 4th and 5th cases slightly vary from these specified.<p>(6) Those who hold that Elihu referred to himself as being the angel, or messenger, that God had sent to make known to Job the truth in regard to the divine government, and the reason why he afflicts people. Of this opinion was Gusset, and we may add that this is the opinion of Umbreit.<p>(7) Those who suppose that some faithful servant of God is intended, without specifying who, who comes to the sick and afflicted, and announces to them the reason of the divine dispensations.<p>II. The second class of opinions is, that an angel is referred to here, and that the meaning is, that God employs angelic beings to communicate His will to people, and especially to the afflicted - to make known to them the reason why they are afflicted, and the assurance that he is willing to show mercy to them if they will repent. Of those who hold this, Schultens mentions<p>(1) the Septuagint which renders it, "the angels of death;"<p>(2) the Chaldee paraphrasist, who understands it of the comforting angel" - the Paraclete;<p>(3) the opinion of Mercer, who supposes it to refer to a good angel, who, though there be a thousand of a contrary description, if he announces the will of God, and shows the true reason why He afflicts people, may be the means of reclaiming them;<p>(4) the opinion of Clerc, who regards it as a mere hypothesis of Elihu, saying that on the supposition that an angel would thus visit people, they might be reclaimed;<p>(5) the opinion of Grotius, who supposes it refers to angels regarded as mediators, who perform their office of mediation in two ways - by admonishing people, and by praying for them. This was also the opinion of Maimonides.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. Elihu refers to himself as the divinely-sent (Job 32:8; 33:6) "messenger," the "interpreter" to explain to Job and vindicate God's righteousness; such a one Eliphaz had denied that Job could look for (Job 5:1), and Job (Job 9:33) had wished for such a "daysman" or umpire between him and God. The "messenger" of good is antithetical to the "destroyers" (Job 33:23).<p>with him&#8212;if there be vouchsafed to the sufferer. The office of the interpreter is stated "to show unto man God's uprightness" in His dealings; or, as Umbreit, "man's upright course towards God" (Pr 14:2). The former is better; Job maintained his own "uprightness" (Job 16:17; 27:5, 6); Elihu on the contrary maintains God's, and that man's true uprightness lies in submission to God. "One among a thousand" is a man rarely to be found. So Jesus Christ (So 5:10). Elihu, the God-sent mediator of a temporal deliverance, is a type of the God-man Jesus Christ the Mediator of eternal deliverance: "the messenger of the covenant" (Mal 3:1). This is the wonderful work of the Holy Ghost, that persons and events move in their own sphere in such a way as unconsciously to shadow forth Him, whose "testimony is the Spirit of prophecy"; as the same point may be center of a small and of a vastly larger concentric circle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A messenger; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

With man, who is expressed in the last clause of this verse, and of whom this same pronoun him is twice used in the next verse. Nor is it strange that the pronoun relative is put before the noun to which it belongs, but usual in the Hebrew language, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm" title="And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept.

By which words he doth covertly reflect upon Job’s three friends, and imply that they were not such persons, though they had undertaken to perform this office or work to Job; and withal, modestly intimates, that although he was in himself mean and inferior to all of them, (as he acknowledgeth,) yet he was selected by God for this work; which he saith not out of a desire of vain boasting of himself, but to dispose Job to a more diligent attention unto, and a more ready entertainment of his present discourses. <span class="ital">His uprightness</span>, or rectitude, or righteousness. <span class="ital">His</span>, i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. God’s; to convince a man that God is just and right in all his dealings with him, though never so severe; of which Job was not yet convinced. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Man’s; to teach man his duty, or to direct him to the right way and method how he may please God, and procure that mercy and deliverance which he thirsts after; which is not by quarrelling with God, as Job did, but by a humble confession and hearty detestation and forsaking of his sins, and supplication to God for mercy in and through Christ the Redeemer, of whom Job spoke before. Or thus, to discover to man, that although he be afflicted, yet he is an upright and righteous person, and consequently in God’s favour; about which good men oft doubt, and need the help of a skilful minister to satisfy them therein. But this seems not so well to suit Job’s case, who was sufficiently and more than enough persuaded of his own integrity, and needed no minister to preach that doctrine to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If there be a messenger with him,.... Or angel, either with God, as some think; or rather with the sick man; by which messenger is meant not an angel by nature, a created angel, though sometimes such are God's messengers, sent by him on errands to men, are interpreters of things to them, as Gabriel was to Daniel; of whom there are thousands, and who may be of service to sick men for their comfort and instruction, since it is certain they attend saints in their dying moments; yet this proves not that they are to be invoked as mediators between God and men: but rather a minister of the word is designed, who is by office an angel, a "messenger" of Christ, and of the churches; an "interpreter" of the Scriptures, and of the mind of God in them; and a spiritual, evangelical, faithful minister, is scarce and rare, one among a thousand; and his business is to visit sick persons, and to observe the "uprightness" and faithfulness of God in afflicting them, that they may quietly submit to and patiently bear the affliction; and to direct them for their peace and comfort to the uprightness or righteousness of Christ, for their justification before God; and to show them what is right for them to do in their present circumstances; whether the sick man be stupid and insensible of his case, and his need of righteousness, or whether he be a truly gracious man, yet labouring under doubts and fears about the truth of grace in him, the uprightness of his heart, and his interest in the righteousness of Christ: but it seems best to understand this of Christ himself, the angel of God's presence, the messenger of the covenant, who is with the sick man, and favours him with his spiritual presence; or is "for him" (q) as it may be rendered, is on his side, an advocate and intercessor for him with God; <p>an interpreter of his Father's mind, and with which he is long acquainted, he lying in his bosom; and of the sacred Scriptures, as he was to his disciples concerning himself; or an "orator" (r), an eloquent one, never man spake like him, having the tongue of the learned given him as man; and who as a divine Person is the eternal and essential Word of God; who spake for his people in the council of peace and covenant of grace; and also as Mediator is the antitypical Aaron, can speak well for them on all occasions: <p>one among a thousand: the chiefest among ten thousand, angels or men; see Sol 5:10; <p>to show unto man his uprightness; which to do is his office as Mediator, and especially as a prophet, even to show the uprightness of God, the rectitude of his nature, the righteousness required in his holy law; and this Christ has shown forth and declared in his being the propitiation for the sins of his people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; by his Spirit he shows to man, and so to a sick man, his want of uprightness in himself, his need of righteousness from another; and brings it near him, and shows it to be perfect, complete, and suitable; as well as teaches to live soberly, righteously, and godly. <p>(q) "pro eo", V.

It is generally supposed that "the angel of the covenant" is meant, and that the whole passage is Messianic; but much obscurity hangs over it. The Jews certainly understand it Messianically, since they read it on the great Day of Atonement, and use in their liturgies the prayer, "Raise up for us the righteous Interpreter; say, I have found a ransom." Elihu's knowledge of an Interpreter, or Mediator, one among a thousand, who should deliver the afflicted man from going down to the pit, and find a ransom for him (ver. 24), is certainly very surprising; and we can scarcely imagine that he understood the full force of his words; but it cannot be right to denude them of their natural signification Elihu certainly did not mean to  speak of himself as an "angel-interpreter, one among a thousand;" and it is not probable that he intends a reference to any merely human helper. <span class="cmt_word">To show unto man. his uprightness</span>; either "to show to a man what it is right for him to do," or "to indicate to a man in what true righteousness consists." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elihu now describes the first mode in which God speaks to man: He Himself comes forward as a witness in man's sleep, He makes use of dreams or dream-like visions, which come upon one suddenly within the realm of nocturnal thought (vid., Psychol.

The reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (Codd., lxx, Syr., Symm., Jer.), as also the accentuation of the &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; with Mehupach Legarme, proceeds from the correct assumption, that vision of the night and dream are not coincident notions; moreover, the detailing <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>, is formed according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>.

Arab. h&#803;&#305;&#770;m, &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, in the sense of infallible attestation and confirmation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>), especially (with Arab. b) of divine revelation or inspiration, distinct in meaning from Arab. chtm, &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, in the proper sense. Elihu means that by such dreams and visions, as rare overpowering facts not to be forgotten, God puts the seal upon the warning directed to them which, sent forth in any other way, would make no such impression. Most ancient versions (also Luther) translate as though it were &#1497;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;). &#1502;&#1505;&#1512; is a secondary form to &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-10.htm">Job 36:10</a>, which occurs only here. Next comes the fuller statement of the object of the admonition or warning delivered in such an impressive manner. According to the text before us, it is to be explained: in order that man may remove (put from himself) mischief from himself (Ges. 133, 3); but this inconvenient change of subject is avoided, if we supply a &#1502; to the second, and read &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1502;&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, as lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (which does not necessarily presuppose the reading &#1502;&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1493;), Targ. ab opere malo; Jer. not so good; ab his quae fecit. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; signifies facinus, an evil deed, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-19.htm">1 Samuel 20:19</a>, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>, evil-doing. The infin. constr. now passes into the v. fin., which would be very liable to misconstruction with different subjects: and in order that He (God) may conceal arrogance from man, i.e., altogether remove from him, unaccustom him to, render him weary of. the sin of pride (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492; from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-29.htm">Job 22:29</a>, according to Ges., Ew., Olsh., for &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;). Here everything in thought and expression is peculiar. Also &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-18.htm">Job 33:18</a> (as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-22.htm">Job 33:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-28.htm">Job 33:28</a>), for &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; rof ,)  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-30.htm">Job 33:30</a>) does not occur elsewhere in the book of Job, and the phrase &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-12.htm">Job 36:12</a> (comp. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-28.htm">Job 33:28</a>) nowhere else in the Old Testament. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; (Arab. sila&#770;h, a weapon of offence, opp. meta&#770;&#8219;, a weapon of defence) is the engine for shooting, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, emmittere, to shoot; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; is equivalent to &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; &#1489;&#1506;&#1491; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; ot tnelaviuqe s, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-8.htm">Joel 2:8</a>, to pass away by (precipitate one's self into) the weapon for shooting. To deliver man from sin, viz., sins of carnal security and imaginary self-importance, and at the same time from an early death, whether natural or violent, this is the disciplinary design which God has in view in connection with this first mode of speaking to him; but there is also a second mode. </body></html>
