Thou forgettest thy distance from him, and castest off that veneration and awe which thou oughtest constantly to maintain toward thy sovereign Lord. Elihu’s argument is, “Notwithstanding all thy pretensions to purity and innocence, thou art far from perfection; there is human frailty enough in thee, and all mankind, to justify the dealings of God with thee or them, however severe they are; give him therefore the glory: acknowledge the justice of his proceedings.” This, in Scripture phrase, is giving God the glory.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:8-13 Elihu charges Job with reflecting upon the justice and goodness of God. When we hear any thing said to God's dishonour, we ought to bear our testimony against it. Job had represented God as severe in marking what he did amiss. Elihu urges that he had spoken wrong, and that he ought to humble himself before God, and by repentance to unsay it. God is not accountable to us. It is unreasonable for weak, sinful creatures, to strive with a God of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness. He acts with perfect justice, wisdom, and goodness, where we cannot perceive it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, in this thou art not just - In this view of God, and in these reflections on his character and government. Such language in regard to the Deity cannot be vindicated; such views cannot be right. It cannot be that he wishes to be the foe of man; that he watches with a jealous eye every movement with a view to find something that will justify him in bringing heavy calamities upon his creatures, or that he sets himself as a spy upon the way in which man goes, in order to find out something that shall make it proper for him to treat him as an enemy. It cannot be denied that Job had indulged in language making substantially such representations of God, and that he had thus given occasion for the reproof of Elihu. It can as little be denied that such thoughts frequently pass through the minds of the afflicted, though they do not express them in words, nor is it less doubtful that they should be at once banished from the soul. They cannot be true. It cannot be that God thus regards and treats his crea tures; that he wishes to find "occasion" in them to make it proper for him to bring calamity upon them, or that he desires to regard them as his foes.<p>I will answer thee - That is, I will show that this view is unjust." This he does in the subsequent verses by stating what he supposes to be the real design of afflictions, and by showing that God in these trials had a good and benevolent object.<p>That -  - &#1499;&#1497;  k&#305;&#770;y. Rather, "because," or "for." The object is not to show that God was greater than man - for that could not be a matter of information, but to show that because he was far above man he had great and elevated objects in his dealings with him, and man should submit to him without a complaint.<p>God is greater than man - The meaning of this is, that man should suppose that God has good reasons for all that he does, and that he might not be qualified to understand the reason of his doings. He should therefore acquiesce in his arrangements, and not call in question the equity of the divine dealings. In all our trials it is well to remember that God is greater than we are. He knows what is best; and though we may not be able to see the reason of his doings, yet it becomes us to acquiesce in his superior wisdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. in this&#8212;view of God and His government. It cannot be that God should jealously "watch" man, though "spotless," as an "enemy," or as one afraid of him as an equal. For "God is greater than man!" There must be sin in man, even though he be no hypocrite, which needs correction by suffering for the sufferer's good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I do not accuse thee of hypocrisy, nor rip up the former errors of thy life; but in this thou art unjust and much to blame, that thou boastest so much of thine own integrity, and chargest God with rigorous dealing, and callest him to an account before thy tribunal, and offerest to dispute the matter with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That God is greater than man; </span> not only in power and majesty, which thou acknowledgest, but also in justice, and wisdom, and goodness; and therefore thou dost very foolishly, and presumptuously, and wickedly in contending with him, and censuring his judgments: thou forgettest thy distance from him, and castest off that awe and reverence which thou shouldst constantly maintain towards thy sovereign Lord. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, in this thou art not just,.... Here begins Elihu's answer, who does not deny that Job was a just man, both before God in an evangelic sense, and before men in a moral sense; he did not go about to detract from Job's general character, as a man that lived soberly, righteously, and godly in the world; but in this he was not just, nor is it to be justified, with respect to this thing, he could not acquit him of doing what was wrong; namely, insisting so much on his own innocence, and tacking therewith such unbecoming and undue reflections on the dealings of God with him; he did not give to God his due, he did not do him justice in representing him in this light; he did not say nor do the right thing, so Mr. Broughton translates the words, <p>"lo, here thou art not in the right;'' <p>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>; <p>I will answer thee; or "I must tell thee"; as the same writer renders the words, being able to make it clear and plain: <p>that God is greater than man: than any man, than the greatest of men, most famous for power, wisdom, or justice; he is not only greater in his power, faithfulness, goodness, grace, and mercy, but in his holiness and righteousness, wisdom and knowledge; and therefore can never do either an unjust thing, or an unwise one; and for man, who is both sinful and ignorant, even the best in comparison of him, to arraign him at his bar, is very arrogant and presumptuous; since he knows best what to do, and what are his reasons for so doing, and is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. The verse probably reads,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Behold in this thou art not in the right, I will answer thee,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For God is greater than man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words <span class="ital">I will answer thee</span> are equivalent to, “Behold, <span class="ital">my answer is</span>, in this thou art not right,” &c. The answer to Job’s charges which Elihu contents himself with giving meantime is simply: “in this thou art not in the right, for God is greater than man.” Elihu, as he does often, e.g. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm" title="They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;">Job 24:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/36-3.htm" title="I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker....">Job 36:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/36-24.htm" title="Remember that you magnify his work, which men behold....">Job 36:24-25</a>, falls back on man’s necessary thoughts of God. Job’s charges are incompatible with just conceptions of God. The three friends had argued in the same way, though they hardly gave the idea the same important place that Elihu does; comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm" title="Does God pervert judgment? or does the Almighty pervert justice?">Job 8:3</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, in this thou art not just</span>. It would certainly not have been a just charge to make against God, that he counted Job as an enemy; and, so far as Job's statements go, it must be admitted that he had laid himself open to Elihu's rebuke. But it is no logical "answer" <span class="accented">to</span> Job's charge to say, in reply to it, <span class="cmt_word">I will answer thee, that God is greater than man</span>. Might does not constitute right, and it is a poor way of justifying God to urge that he is all-powerful, and may do what he likes. So Cambyses was justified in his worst acts by the royal judges (Herod., 3:31); and so in an absolute monarchy it is always possible to justify the extremest acts of tyranny. Certainly God cannot act unjustly; but this is not because his doing a thing makes it right, but because his justice, is a law to his will, and he never wills to do anything that he has not previously seen to be just (see Cudworth's 'Immutable Morality,' which deserves the careful study, not alone of moralists, but also of theologians). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  4  The Spirit of God hath made me,<p>And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.<p>  5  If thou canst, answer me,<p>Prepare in my presence, take thy stand!<p>  6  Behold, I am like thyself, of God,<p>Formed out of clay am Ialso.<p>  7  Behold, my terror shall not affright thee,<p>And my pressure shall not be heavy upon thee.<p>He has both in common with Job: the spirituality as well as the earthliness of man's nature; but by virtue of the former he does not, indeed, feel himself exalted above Job's person, but above the present standpoint taken up by Job; and in consideration of this, Job need not fear any unequal contest, nor as before God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, in order that he may be able to defend himself against Him, make it a stipulation that His majesty may not terrify him. It is man's twofold origin which Elihu, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>, gives utterance to in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> : the mode of man's origin, which is exalted above that of all other earthly beings that have life; for the life of the animal is only the individualizing of the breath of the Divine Spirit already existing in matter. The spirit of man, on the contrary (for which the language has reserved the name &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;), is an inspiration directly coming forth from God the personal being, transferred into the bodily frame, and therefore forming a person.<p>(Note: God took a small piece of His own life - says the tradition among the Karens, a scattered tribe of Eastern India - blew into the nostrils of His son and daughter, and they became living beings, and were really human.)<p>In the exalted consciousness of having been originated by the Spirit of God, and being endowed with life from the inbreathed breath of the Almighty, Elihu stands invincible before Job: if thou canst, refute me (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with acc. of the person, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-32.htm">Job 33:32</a>); array thyself (&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, according to Ges. 63, rem. 1) before me (here with the additional thought of &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>, in a forensic sense with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;), place thyself in position, or take thy post (imper. Hithpa. with the ah less frequent by longer forms, Ew. 228, a).<p>On the other side, he also, like Job, belongs to God, i.e., is dependent and conditioned. &#1492;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is to be written with Segol (not Ssere); &#1500;&#1488;&#1500; is intended like &#1500;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-16.htm">Job 12:16</a>; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1498; signifies properly, according to thine utterance, i.e., standard, in accordance with, i.e., like thee, and is used even in the Pentateuch (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>) in this sense pro ratione; &#1499;&#1508;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18</a>, we took differently. He, Elihu, is also nipped from the clay, i.e., taken from the earth, as when the potter nips off a piece of his clay (comp. Aram. &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, a piece, Arab. qurs, a bread-cake, or a dung-cake, vid., supra, p. 449, from qarasa, to pinch off, take off, cogn. qarada, to gnaw off, cut off, p. 512). Thus, therefore, no terribleness in his appearing will disconcert Job, and his pressure will not be a burden upon him. By a comparison of <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, it might seem that &#1488;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; (lxx &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), but &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; is everywhere connected only with &#1497;&#1491;, never with &#1499;&#1468;&#1507;; and the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. is explained according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>, where &#1488;&#1499;&#1507; signifies to oppress, drive (Jer. compulit), and from the dialects differently, for in Syr. ecaf signifies to be anxious about anything (ecaf li, it causes me anxiety, curae mihi est), and in Arab. accafa, to saddle, uca&#770;f, Talmud. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1507;, a saddle, so that consequently the Targ. translation of &#1488;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; by &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, my burden, and the Syr. by &#1488;&#1493;&#1499;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, my pressing forward (Arabic version iqba&#770;li, my touch), are supported, since &#1488;&#1499;&#1507; signifies pressure, heavy weight, load, and burden; according to which it is also translated by Saad. (my constraint), Gecat. (my might). It is therefore not an opponent who is not on an equality with him by nature, with whom Job has to do. If he is not able to answer him, he will have to be considered as beaten. </body></html>
