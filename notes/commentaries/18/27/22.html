Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man, is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but, to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away to destruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but now the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon him his wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, nor bearing up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms of Divine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able to flee from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them. And what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and thus lose his own soul?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For God shall cast upon him - That is, God shall bring calamities upon him, or cast his thunderbolts upon him, and shall not pity him.<p>He would fain flee - He would gladly escape from the wrath of God, but he is unable to do it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. cast&#8212;namely, thunderbolts (Job 6:4; 7:20; 16:13; Ps 7:12, 13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God shall cast upon him</span> his darts or plagues, one after another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And not spare, </span> i.e. shall show no pity nor mercy to him, when he crieth to God for it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He would fain flee out of his hand; </span> he earnestly desires and endeavours by all ways possible to escape the judgments of God, but all in vain. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For God shall cast upon him, and not spare,.... Cast his sins upon him, which will lie as an intolerable weight upon his conscience; and his wrath upon him, which being poured out like fire, he will not be able to bear it; and deserved punishment on him, which, like a talent of lead, will bear him down to the lowest hell; and this will be done without showing any mercy at all; for, though the wicked have much of sparing mercy in this world, they have none in the next; there is sparing mercy now, but none in hell; God, that spared not the angels that sinned, nor the old world, nor Sodom and Gomorrah, will not spare them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>; he that made them will have no mercy on them; and he that formed them will show them no favour: <p>he would fain flee out of his hands; in whose hands he is, not as all men are, being the works of his hands, and supported by him; much less as his people are, secure there; but in his hands as an awful and terrible Judge, condemning him for his sins, and sentencing him to everlasting punishment; and a fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the living and almighty God: there is no getting out of them, though "fleeing, he flees", as the phrase is, with all his might and main, with all the swiftness he can; it is all to no purpose; he is where he was, and must continue in the torment and misery he is in to all eternity; his worm of conscience will never die, nor the fire of divine wrath be ever quenched; though he will desire death ten thousand times over, he shall not find it, it shall flee from him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-6.htm">Revelation 9:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">shall cast upon him</span>] i. e. shall shoot down upon him His destroying arrows, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-20.htm" title="But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;">Numbers 35:20</a>.

The sword, famine, and pestilence are the three punishing powers by which the evil-doer's posterity, however numerous it may be, is blotted out; these three, &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, &#1512;&#1506;&#1489;, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, appear also side by side in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, instead of &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, diris mortibus, is (as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>) equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; in the same trio, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>; the plague is personified (as when it is called by an Arabian poet umm el-farit, the mother of death), and Vavassor correctly observes: Mors illos sua sepeliet, nihil praeterea honoris supremi consecuturos. Bttcher (de inferis, 72) asserts that &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; can only signify pestilentiae tempore, or better, ipso mortis momento; but since &#1489;&#1468; occurs by the passive elsewhere in the sense of ab or per, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4</a>, it can also by &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1512; denote the efficient cause.

The treasure in gold which his avarice has heaped up, and in garments which his love of display has gathered together, come into the possession of the righteous and the innocent, who are spared when these three powers of judgment sweep away the evil-doer and his family. Dust and dirt (i.e., of the streets, &#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;) are, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>, the emblem of a great abundance that depreciates even that which is valuable. The house of the ungodly man, though a palace, is, as the fate of the fabric shows, as brittle and perishable a thing, and can be as easily destroyed, as the fine spinning of a moth, &#1506;&#1513;&#1473; (according to the Jewish proverb, the brother of the &#1505;&#1505;), or even the small case which it makes from remnants of gnawed articles, and drags about with it; it is like a light hut, perhaps for the watchman of a vineyard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>), which is put together only for the season during which the grapes are ripening.<p>continued...</body></html>
