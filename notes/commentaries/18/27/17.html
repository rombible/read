Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man, is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but, to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away to destruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but now the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon him his wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, nor bearing up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms of Divine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able to flee from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them. And what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and thus lose his own soul?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The just shall put it on - The righteous shall wear it. It shall pass out of the hands of him who prepared it, into the hands of others. The meaning is, that the wicked, though they become rich, would not live to enjoy their ill-gotten gains. These two verses contain a beautiful illustration of what Dr. Jebb calls the introverted parallelism - where the fourth member answers to the first, and the third to the second:<p>"Though he heap up silver as the dust,<p>And prepare raiment as the clay,<p>The just shall put it (raiment) on,<p>And the innocent shall divide the silver."<p>A similar instance occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a> :<p>"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,<p>Neither cast ye your pearls before swine,<p>Lest they (the swine) trample them under their feet.<p>And (the dogs) turn again and rend you."<p>For a full illustration of the nature of Hebrew poetry, the reader may consult DeWette, Einleitung in die Psalmen, translated in the Biblical Repository, vol. iii. pp. 445ff, and Nordheimer's Hebrew Grammar, vol. ii. pp. 319ff; see also the Introduction to Job, Section V.<p>The innocent shall divide the silver - That is, the righteous shall come into possession of it, and divide it among themselves.

He is not one of the godless; for what is the hope of one who is estranged from God, when he comes to die? He has no God on whom his hope might establish itself, to whom it could cling. The old expositors err in many ways respecting <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>, by taking &#1489;&#1510;&#1506;, abscindere (root &#1489;&#1509;), in the sense of (opes) corradere (thus also more recently Rosenm. after the Targ., Syr., and Jer.), and referring &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492; in the signification tranquillum esse (thus even Blumenfeld after Ralbag and others). &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is the object to both verbs, and &#1489;&#1510;&#1506; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, abscindere animam, to cut off the thread of life, is to be explained according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, extrahere animam (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;, whence &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495; Arab. salan, the after-birth, cogn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; . Arab. sll, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; Arab. nsl, nt&#817;l, ns&#780;l), is of similar signification, according to another figure, wince the body is conceived of as the sheath (&#1504;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a>) of the soul <p>(Note: On the similar idea of the body, as the kosha (sheath) of the soul, among the Hindus, vid., Psychol. S. 227.)<p>(comp. Arab. sll in the universal signification evaginare ensem). The fut. apoc. Kal &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; ( equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;) is therefore in meaning equivalent to the intrans. &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-40.htm">Deuteronomy 28:40</a> (according to Ew. 235, c, obtained from this by change of vowel), decidere; and Schnurrer's supposition that &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, like the Arab. ysl, is equivalent to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; (when God demands it), or such a violent correction as De Lagarde's<p>(Note: Anm. zur griech.
