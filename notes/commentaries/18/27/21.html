Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man, is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but, to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away to destruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but now the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon him his wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, nor bearing up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms of Divine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able to flee from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them.

Severe storms are represented in this book as coming from the East; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>. The ancients believed that people might be carried away by a tempest or whirlwind; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>; see also Homer, Odyssey xx. 63ff:<p>"Snatch me, ye whirlwinds far from human race,<p>Test through the void illimitable space;<p>Or if dismounted from the rapid cloud,<p>Me with his whelming wave let Ocean shroud!"<p>Pope<p>Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>. The parallelism here would seem to imply that the wind referred to was violent, but it is possible that the allusion may be to the burning winds of the desert, so well known in the East, and so frequently described by travelers. The Vulgate here renders the Hebrew word &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;  qa&#770;d&#305;&#770;ym, ventus urens, "burning wind;" the Septuagint in like manner, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  kauso&#772;n; the Syriac simply wind. This east wind, or burning wind, is what the Arabians call Samum. It is a hot wind which passes over the desert, and which was formerly supposed to be destructive of life. More recent travelers however, tell us that it is not fatal to life, though exceedingly oppressive.<p>And as a storm - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-9.htm">Psalm 58:9</a>.<p>Hurleth him out of his place - Takes him entirely away, or removes him from the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Which is very strong and powerful, and carries all before it; afflictions are sometimes compared to it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>; and here either death, accompanied with the wrath of God, which carries the wicked man, sore against his will, out of the world, from his house, his family, his friends, his possessions, and estates, and carries him to hell to be a companion with devils, and share with them in all the miseries of that dreadful state and place. The Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions render it, "a burning wind", such as are frequent in the eastern countries, which carry a man off at once, so that he has only time at most to say, I burn, and immediately drops down dead, as Thevenot, and other travellers, relate; which is thus described; <p>"it is a wind called "Samiel", or poison wind, a very hot one, that reigns in summer from Mosul to Surrat, but only by land, not upon the water; they who have breathed that wind fall instantly dead upon the place, though sometimes they have time to say that they burn within. No sooner does a man die by this wind but he becomes as black as a coal; and if one take him by his leg, arm, or any other place, his flesh comes from the same, and is plucked off by the hand that would lift him up (n):'' <p>and again, it is observed, that in Persia, if a man, in June or July, breathes in certain hot south winds that come from the sea, he falls down dead, and at most has no more time than to say he burns (o). Wicked men are like chaff and stubble, and they can no more resist death than either of these can resist the east wind; and they are as easily burnt up and consumed with the burning wind of God's wrath as they are by devouring flames; and though wicked men and hypocrites may think all will be well with them if they have but time to say, Lord have mercy on us; they may be carried off with such a burning wind, or scorching disease, as to be able only to say, that they burn, and not in their bodies only, but in their souls also, feeling the wrath of God in their consciences: or this may have respect to the devouring flames of hell they are surrounded with upon dying, or immediately after death, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-14.htm">Isaiah 33:14</a>; <p>and he departeth; out of the world, not willingly, but, whether he will or not, he must depart; or rather he will be bid to depart, and he will depart from the bar of God, from his presence, into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: <p>an as a storm hurleth him out of his place: this is done either at death, when as a storm hurls a tree, or any other thing, out of its place, so is the sinner forced out of his place in a tempestuous manner, through the power and wrath of God, so that his place knows him no more; and he is hurried into hell and everlasting destruction, just as the sinning angels were hurled out of heaven, and cast down into hell, and there will be no place found in heaven for them any more; or rather this will be his case at judgment, which immediately follows, where the wicked shall not stand, or be able to justify themselves, and make their case good; but with the storm of divine wrath and vengeance shall be hurled from thence, and go, being driven, into everlasting punishment. <p>(n) Thevenot's Travels into the Levant, par. 2.

The sword, famine, and pestilence are the three punishing powers by which the evil-doer's posterity, however numerous it may be, is blotted out; these three, &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, &#1512;&#1506;&#1489;, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, appear also side by side in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, instead of &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, diris mortibus, is (as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>) equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; in the same trio, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>; the plague is personified (as when it is called by an Arabian poet umm el-farit, the mother of death), and Vavassor correctly observes: Mors illos sua sepeliet, nihil praeterea honoris supremi consecuturos. Bttcher (de inferis, 72) asserts that &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; can only signify pestilentiae tempore, or better, ipso mortis momento; but since &#1489;&#1468; occurs by the passive elsewhere in the sense of ab or per, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4</a>, it can also by &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1512; denote the efficient cause.

The treasure in gold which his avarice has heaped up, and in garments which his love of display has gathered together, come into the possession of the righteous and the innocent, who are spared when these three powers of judgment sweep away the evil-doer and his family. Dust and dirt (i.e., of the streets, &#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;) are, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>, the emblem of a great abundance that depreciates even that which is valuable. The house of the ungodly man, though a palace, is, as the fate of the fabric shows, as brittle and perishable a thing, and can be as easily destroyed, as the fine spinning of a moth, &#1506;&#1513;&#1473; (according to the Jewish proverb, the brother of the &#1505;&#1505;), or even the small case which it makes from remnants of gnawed articles, and drags about with it; it is like a light hut, perhaps for the watchman of a vineyard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>), which is put together only for the season during which the grapes are ripening.<p>continued...</body></html>
