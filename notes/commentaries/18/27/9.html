If they gained through life by their profession, and kept up their presumptuous hope till death, what would that avail when God required their souls? The more comfort we find in our religion, the more closely we shall cleave to it. Those who have no delight in God, are easily drawn away by the pleasures, and easily overcome by the crosses of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? - Coverdale has rendered this <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8-9</a> so as to make excellent sense, though not strictly in accordance with the original. "What hope hath the hypocrite though he have great good, and though God give him riches after his heart's desire? Doth God hear him the sooner, when he crieth unto him in his necessity?" The object of the verse is to show the miserable condition of a wicked man or a hypocrite. This is shown by the fact which Job asserts, that God will not hear his cry when he feels his need of aid, and when he is induced to call upon him. This is true only when his object in calling upon God is merely for help. If he has no relentings for his sin, and no real confidence in God; if he calls upon him in trouble, intending to return to his sins as soon as the trouble is over, or if such is the state of his mind that God sees that he would return to his sins as soon as his calamities cease, then he cannot be expected to hear him. But if he comes with a penitent heart, and with a sincere purpose to forsake his sins and to devote himself to God, there is no reason to doubt that he would bear him. The argument of Job is in the main sound. It is, that if a man wishes the favor of God, and the assurance that he will hear his prayer, he must lead a holy life. A hypocrite cannot expect his favor: compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

No, he will not, he heareth not sinners, and such as regard iniquity in their hearts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a>; every man has trouble more or less in this life, even the best of men; and generally speaking they have the most, and wicked men the least; but when death comes, he is a king of terrors to them, and they find sorrow and trouble; and especially at the day of judgment, when they will cry for mercy; and hypocrites, as the foolish virgins, will cry, "Lord, Lord, open unto us", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-11.htm">Matthew 25:11</a>; but when they call for mercy, the Lord will not answer, but laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>; but God hears the cries of his people when in, trouble, whether in, life, or, in death, and is a present help unto them; and when, strength and heart fail, he is their portion, and will be so for evermore; and though sometimes they think he does not hear them, as Job sometimes complains, yet he makes it appear that he does sooner or later, and so Job describes himself as one that "calleth upon God, and he answereth him", <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a>; and therefore might conclude he was no hypocrite. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon Him?</span> Can he expect that in the day of trouble, "when distress and anguish come upon him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>), God will hear his cry, and respond to it, and give him relief? No; conscious hypocrisy - living a lie - cuts off from God, severs between a man and his Maker, makes all prayers for help vain, until it is repented of and put away from us.
