This does not imply that we may lawfully wish any man to be wicked, or that any man who is not wicked should be treated as wicked; but we ought all rather to choose to be in the condition of a beggar, an outlaw, a galley-slave, any thing rather than in the condition of the wicked, though in ever so much outward pomp and prosperity. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:7-10 Job looked upon the condition of a hypocrite and a wicked man, to be most miserable. If they gained through life by their profession, and kept up their presumptuous hope till death, what would that avail when God required their souls? The more comfort we find in our religion, the more closely we shall cleave to it. Those who have no delight in God, are easily drawn away by the pleasures, and easily overcome by the crosses of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let mine enemy be as the wicked - This is probably said that he might show that it was not his intention to justify the wicked, and that in all that he had said it was no part of his purpose to express approbation of their course. His friends had charged him with this; but he now solemnly disclaims it, and says that he had no such design. To show how little he meant to justify the wicked, he says that the utmost that he could desire for an enemy would be, that he would be treated as he believed the wicked would be. A similar expression occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>, "My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies;" that is, calamities are coming upon thee indicated by the dream, such as you would desire on your foes; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>. After the mother of Sisera had anxiously looked for the return of her son from the battle, though he was then slain, the sacred writer adds, "So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord." Thus, when a traitor is executed it is common for the executioner to hold up his head and say, "So let all the enemies of the king die." Job means to say that he had no sympathy with wicked people, and that he believed that they would be punished as certainly and as severely as one could desire his enemy to suffer. Schnurrer supposes that by the enemy here he refers to his friends with whom he had been disputing; but this is to give an unnecessarily harsh construction to the passage. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Job in this, and some following verses, shows, that he was not, and could not, and would not be a wicked man and an hypocrite, or however had no opinion and liking of such persons; for whatever his friends might think of him, because he had said so much of their outward prosperity in this world; yet he was far from approving of or conniving at their wickedness and hypocrisy, or choosing them for his companions, and joining with them in their actions, or imagining they were really happy persons; so far from it, that he would not be in their condition and circumstances for all the world: for if he was to wish a bad thing to the greatest enemy he had, he could not wish him any worse than to be as a wicked and unrighteous man; that is, to be a wicked and unrighteous man; which it is impossible for a good man to wish, and indeed would be a needless wish, since all that are enemies to good men, as such, must be wicked; and such were Job's enemies, as the Chaldeans and Sabeans; but that they might be as such, in their state and circumstances, or rather as they will be in the consequence of things, most wretched and miserable; for they are always under the displeasure of God, and hated by him; and whatever fulness they may have of the things of this world, they have them with a curse, and they are curses to them, and their end will be everlasting ruin and destruction; wherefore the Septuagint version is, <p>"as the overthrow of the ungodly, and as the perdition of transgressors;'' <p>though some take this to be a kind of an ironic imprecation, and that by the wicked man here, and unrighteous in the next clause, he means himself, whom his friends reckoned a wicked and unrighteous man; and then the sense is, I wish you all, my friends, and even the worst enemies I have, were but as wicked Job is, as you call him; not that he wished they might be afflicted in body, family, and estate, as he was, but that they were as good men as he was, and partook of as much of the grace of God as he did, and had the same integrity and righteousness as he had, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-29.htm">Acts 26:29</a>; and such a wish as this, as it serves to illustrate his own character, so it breathes charity and good will to others; and indeed it cannot be thought the words are to be taken in such a sense as that he wished the same evils might be retorted upon his enemies, whether open or secret, which they were the means of bringing upon him, which was contrary to the spirit of Job, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a>. Some consider them not as an imprecation, but as a prediction, "mine enemy shall be as the wicked" (e); and may have respect to his friends, who were so ready to charge him with wickedness, and suggests that in the issue of thin; they would be found, and not he, guilty of sin folly, and to have said the things that were not right, neither of God, nor of him, which had its accomplishment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>; <p>and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous; which is but another way of expressing the same thing; for an enemy, and one that rises up against a man, is the same person; only this the better explains what enemy is intended, even an open one, that rises up in an hostile manner, full of rage and fury; and so a wicked and an unrighteous man are the same, and are frequently put together as describing the same sort of persons, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>. <p>(e)   "erit ut impius inimieus meus", Pagninus, Montanus, Boldacius; so Junius &amp; Tremellius, Broughton, &amp; Ramban. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

With <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-7.htm" title="Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that rises up against me as the unrighteous.">Job 27:7</a></span> commences a description of the misery of mind, and the outward destruction at the hand of God, which are the portion of the unrighteous. The “wicked” is the subject throughout to the end of the chapter; therefore in the words “let mine enemy be as the wicked” the emphasis falls on “wicked.” The words express the speaker’s abhorrence of the “wicked,” they do not imprecate evil on his “enemy.” It it understood that he wishes his “enemy” ill, and he can wish him nothing worse than that he should be as the “wicked”—so much does he himself shrink from the thought of being as the wicked are. Others (e.g. Delitzsch) put the emphasis on “enemy,” taking that expression to mean “him who accuses me of iniquity”—mine enemy must appear an evil-doer, inasmuch as he charges me falsely. This makes the verse a mere parenthetical imprecation by Job on his friends, for the words taken in this sense have no connexion with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/27-8.htm" title="For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his soul?...">Job 27:8-10</a></span>. The speaker, rather, repudiates the idea of his being one of the wicked, and he does so because he shudders to think that the condition of the mind of the wicked man, who has no hope in God, should be his—his condition of mind is very different (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/27-8.htm" title="For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his soul?...">Job 27:8-10</a></span>). Still even when taken in this, their only natural sense, the words of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-7.htm" title="Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that rises up against me as the unrighteous.">Job 27:7</a></span> have no strict logical connexion with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/27-2.htm" title="As God lives, who has taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who has vexed my soul;...">Job 27:2-6</a></span>. The connexion is: “I will never cease to maintain that I am a righteous man, for how comfortless in calamity is the condition of the wicked!” while strictly it should be: “I will never cease holding on to the way of righteousness, for how comfortless in affliction is the wicked man, having no hope in God!” So far as the mere language of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/27-5.htm" title="God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove my integrity from me....">Job 27:5-6</a></span> is concerned, the expressions “I will not remove mine integrity from me,” “and my righteousness I hold fast,” might have the meaning “I will continue to live a righteous life” (comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm" title="Then said his wife to him, Do you still retain your integrity? curse God, and die.">Job 2:9</a>), but such a meaning is absolutely excluded here by the connexion and general scope of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/27-2.htm" title="As God lives, who has taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who has vexed my soul;...">Job 27:2-6</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">7–10</span>.

The nexus of this passage with what goes before is uncertain. Some suppose Job's full thought to have been, "Ye try to persuade me to act wickedly by making a false representation of my feelings and convictions; but I absolutely refuse to do so. Let that rather be the act of my enemy." Others regard him as simply so vexed by his pretended friends, who are his real enemies, that he is driven to utter an imprecation against them. <span class="cmt_word">And he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous</span>. This is another instance of a mere pleonastic hemistich - a repetition of the preceding clause in different words. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then Job continued to take up his proverb, and said:<p>  2  As God liveth, who hath deprived me of my right,<p>And the Almighty, who hath sorely saddened my soul - <p>  3  For still all my breath is in me,<p>And the breath of Eloah in my nostrils - <p>  4  My lips do not speak what is false,<p>And my tongue uttereth not deceit!<p>  5  Far be it from me, to grant that you are in the right:<p>Till I die I will not remove my innocence from me.<p>  6  My righteousness I hold fast, and let it not go:<p>My heart reproacheth not any of my days.<p>  7  Mine enemy must appear as an evil-doer,<p>And he who riseth up against me as unrighteous.<p>The friends are silent, Job remains master of the discourse, and his continued speech is introduced as a continued &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; (after the analogy of the phrase &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a> and further on, the oracles of Balaam. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; is speech of a more elevated tone and more figurative character; here, as frequently, the unaffected outgrowth of an elevated solemn mood. The introduction of the ultimatum, as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, reminds one of "the proverb (el-methel) seals it" in the mouth of the Arab, since in common life it is customary to use a pithy saying as the final proof at the conclusion of a speech.<p>continued...</body></html>
