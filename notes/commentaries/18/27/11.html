Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man, is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but, to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away to destruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but now the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon him his wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, nor bearing up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms of Divine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able to flee from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them. And what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and thus lose his own soul?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will teach you by the hand of God - Margin, "or, being in."

The idea evidently is, that Job would instruct them by what God had done. He would appeal to his works, and to the dispensations of his providence; and by the indications of wisdom and skill which were to be found there, he would derive important lessons for their instruction on the great principles of his administration. Accordingly, in the remainder of this chapter, he makes his appeal to what actually occurs in the dispensations of Providence, and in the next, he refers to various scientific subjects, evincing the wisdom which God had shown in the mineral kingdom. The hand is the instrument by which we accomplish anything, and hence, it is used here to denote what God does.<p>That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal - That is, I will appeal to his works, and show what traces of wisdom there are in them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-23. These words are contrary to Job's previous sentiments (see on [520]Job 21:22-33; [521]Job 24:22-25). Job 21:22-33; 24:22-25). They therefore seem to be Job's statement, not so much of his own sentiments, as of what Zophar would have said had he spoken when his turn came (end of the twenty-sixth chapter). So Job stated the friends' opinion (Job 21:17-21; 24:18-21). The objection is, why, if so, does not Job answer Zophar's opinion, as stated by himself? The fact is, it is probable that Job tacitly, by giving, in the twenty-eighth chapter, only a general answer, implies, that in spite of the wicked often dying, as he said, in prosperity, he does not mean to deny that the wicked are in the main dealt with according to right, and that God herein vindicates His moral government even here. Job therefore states Zophar's argument more strongly than Zophar would have done. But by comparing Job 27:13 with Job 20:29 ("portion," "heritage"), it will be seen, it is Zophar's argument, rather than his own, that Job states. Granting it to be true, implies Job, you ought not to use it as an argument to criminate me. For (Job 28:1-28) the ways of divine wisdom in afflicting the godly are inscrutable: all that is sure to man is, the fear of the Lord is wisdom (Job 28:28).<p>by the hand&#8212;rather, concerning the hand of God, namely, what God does in governing men.<p>with the Almighty&#8212;the counsel or principle which regulates God's dealings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By the hand of God, </span> i.e. by God’s help and inspiration; as God is said to speak to the prophet <span class="ital">with</span> or <span class="ital">by a strong</span> hand, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm" title="For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,">Isaiah 8:11</a></span>.

To serve God, and speak truth, says one of the Jewish commentators (g); rather the works of God, and methods of his providence, with wicked men and hypocrites; the wisdom of God in his dispensations towards them; the reasons why he suffers them to live in outward prosperity and happiness, and what in the issue will be their case and circumstances; wherefore some render the words, "I will teach you the hand of God", or "of", or "concerning the hand of God" (h); and so Mr. Broughton, of God, his hand; not his works of nature which his hand had wrought, of which he had discoursed in the preceding chapter; but his works of providence, and those more mysterious ones relating to the afflictions of the godly, and the prosperity of the wicked. Job had been a teacher and instructor of others in the times of his prosperity, and his words had upheld, strengthened, and comforted many, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-3.htm">Job 4:3</a>; and he was not the less qualified for, nor the less capable of such an office now in his adversity, which had been a school to him, in which he had learned many useful lessons himself, and so was in a better capacity of teaching others. Thus some render the words, "I will teach you", being in or "under the hand of God" (i); under his mighty hand, his afflicting, chastising hand, which had touched him, and pressed him sore, and yet had guided and instructed him in many things, and particularly relating to the subject he proposed to instruct his friends in; who, though they were men of knowledge, and in years, yet he apprehended needed instruction; and he undertook to give them some by the good hand of God upon him, through his help and assistance, and under the influences and teachings of his spirit. The Targum is, <p>"I will teach you by the prophecy of God;'' <p>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <p>that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal; meaning not the secret purposes and decrees of God within himself, which cannot be known, unless he reveals them; rather secret truths, which are not obvious to everyone, the mysteries of the kingdom, the wisdom of God in a mystery, the knowledge of which the Lord vouchsafes to some of his people in a very peculiar manner; though the mysteries of Providence seem chiefly intended, which those that carefully observe attain to an understanding of, so as to be capable of instructing others; and indeed what is in reserve with God for men among his treasures, whether of grace or glory for his own peculiar people, or especially of wrath and vengeance for wicked men and hypocrites, may be here designed; and whatever knowledge men have of the mysteries of nature, providence, and grace, which may be profitable unto others, and make for the glory of God, should not be concealed from men, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a>. <p>(g) Simeon Bar Tzemach.

In a brief preface Job intimates that he will instruct his friends regarding the hand of God, that is, His operation, His method of dealing with the wicked.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the Almighty</span>] There is no just ground for restricting the phrase <span class="ital">with</span> the Almighty to the meaning, the plans or purposes of the Almighty, the general principles of His government, which continue to be His principles though they may not for a time appear in actual operation. Such a limitation is interpolated into the text, and is contrary to the parallelism of the first clause. In <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-13.htm" title="This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.">Job 27:13</a></span> the same phrase occurs, “the portion of the wicked man <span class="ital">with</span> God,” which is interpreted in the next clause as “the heritage which they receive <span class="ital">from</span> the Almighty.” The words refer to no <span class="ital">ideal</span> of moral government, such as always exists and <span class="ital">may</span> always manifest itself; they describe God’s actual treatment of the wicked man, apart from all limitation. This is the doctrine of the three friends; that of Job in ch. 21, and even ch. 24 was very different.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">11–23</span>. The disastrous fate of the wicked man at the hand of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/27-7.htm" title="Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that rises up against me as the unrighteous....">Job 27:7-10</a> drew a contrast between the internal state of the mind of the speaker and that of the sinner; in these verses the contrast is pursued in a terrible picture of the external history and fate of the sinner at the hand of God. From Job’s hand such a picture can have no meaning, unless <span class="ital">either</span> he now anticipates for himself a happy issue out of his afflictions, and restoration to prosperity, while the calamities that befall the wicked are final; <span class="ital">or</span> regards his own afflictions, even though they should bring him unto death, as altogether different in their character and marks from those that bring the wicked man to destruction. Either side of the alternative sets Job in complete contradiction to his position in the chapters that precede and follow this one. On the former side see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-10.htm" title="Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call on God?">Job 27:10</a></span>. The latter side supposes Job now to take a view of his afflictions entirely opposed to that which he has hitherto taken and continues to take, namely that they are due to the enmity and hostility of God (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-24.htm" title="Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?">Job 13:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm" title="He tears me in his wrath, who hates me: he gnashes on me with his teeth; my enemy sharpens his eyes on me.">Job 16:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-11.htm" title="He has also kindled his wrath against me, and he counts me to him as one of his enemies.">Job 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm" title="Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?">Job 19:22</a>, but also ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-21.htm" title="You are become cruel to me: with your strong hand you oppose yourself against me.">Job 30:21</a>, and even the present chap. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/27-2.htm" title="As God lives, who has taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who has vexed my soul;...">Job 27:2-6</a></span>)—a view which Elihu severely animadverts upon, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-10.htm" title="Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,">Job 33:10</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>. And the idea that to become the prey of pestilence and sword (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/27-14.htm" title="If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread....">Job 27:14-15</a></span>) is a sure mark of a wicked man, while to be the victim of a fatal and loathsome malady is no such proof of wickedness (Delitzsch), is one which it is difficult to treat with seriousness.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-23.</span> - It is impossible to deny that this passage directly contradicts Job's former utterances, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>. But the hypotheses which would make Job irresponsible for the present utterance and fix on him, as his steadfast conviction, the opposite theory, are unsatisfactory and have no solid basis. To suppose that Zophar is the real speaker is to imagine the absolute loss and suppression of two entire verses - one between vers. 10 and 11, assigning the speech to him, and another at the beginning  of ch. 28, reintroducing Job and making him once more the interlocutor. That this should have happened by accident is inconceivable. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> To ascribe it to intentional corruption by a Hebrew redactor, bent on maintaining the old orthodox view, and on falsely and wickedly giving the authority of Job to it (Froude 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1. p. 316), is to take away all authority from the existing text of the Hebrew Scriptures, and to open a door to any amount of wild suggestion and conjectural emendation. The other hypothesis - that of Eichhorn - that Job is here simply anticipating what his adversaries will say, though a less dangerous view, is untenable, since Job never does this without following up his statement of the adversaries' ease with a reply, and here is no reply whatever, but a simple turning away, after ver. 23, to another subject. The explanation of the contradiction by supposing that Job's former statement was tentative and controversial, or else hasty and ill-considered, and that now, to prevent misconception, he determines to set himself right, is, on the other hand, thoroughly defensible, and receives a strong support from the remarkable introduction in ver. 11, which "prepares us, if not for a recantation, yet (at any rate) for a modification of statements wrung from the speaker when his words flowed over from a spirit drunk with the poison of God's arrows" (see the remarks of Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 90, which are in substantial agreement with those of Ewald said Dillmann). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will teach you by</span> (or, concerning) <span class="cmt_word">the hand of God</span>. Job is now at last about to deliver his real sentiments respecting God's dealings with men in the world, and prefaces his. remarks with this solemn introduction, to draw special attention to them. He is aware that his previous statements on the subject, especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>, have been overstrained and exaggerated, and wishes, now that he is uttering his last words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-40.htm">Job 31:40</a>), to correct his previous hasty utterances, and put on record his true views. <span class="cmt_word">That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal</span>. By "that which is with the Almighty" Job means the Divine principles of action. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then Job continued to take up his proverb, and said:<p>  2  As God liveth, who hath deprived me of my right,<p>And the Almighty, who hath sorely saddened my soul - <p>  3  For still all my breath is in me,<p>And the breath of Eloah in my nostrils - <p>  4  My lips do not speak what is false,<p>And my tongue uttereth not deceit!<p>  5  Far be it from me, to grant that you are in the right:<p>Till I die I will not remove my innocence from me.<p>  6  My righteousness I hold fast, and let it not go:<p>My heart reproacheth not any of my days.<p>  7  Mine enemy must appear as an evil-doer,<p>And he who riseth up against me as unrighteous.<p>The friends are silent, Job remains master of the discourse, and his continued speech is introduced as a continued &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; (after the analogy of the phrase &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a> and further on, the oracles of Balaam. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; is speech of a more elevated tone and more figurative character; here, as frequently, the unaffected outgrowth of an elevated solemn mood. The introduction of the ultimatum, as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, reminds one of "the proverb (el-methel) seals it" in the mouth of the Arab, since in common life it is customary to use a pithy saying as the final proof at the conclusion of a speech.<p>continued...</body></html>
