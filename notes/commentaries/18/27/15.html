Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man, is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but, to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away to destruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but now the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon him his wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, nor bearing up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms of Divine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able to flee from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them. And what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and thus lose his own soul?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Those that remain of him - Those that survive him.<p>Shall be buried in death - Hebrew "shall be buried BY death" (&#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;  bama&#770;veth), that is. "Death shall be the grave-digger" - or, they shall have no friends to bury them; they shall be unburied. The idea is highly poetical, and the expression is very tender. They would have no one to weep over them, and no one to prepare for them a grave; there would be no procession, no funeral dirge, no train of weeping attendants; even the members of their own family would not weep over them. To be unburied has always been regarded as a dishonor and calamity (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>), and is often referred to as such in the Scriptures; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>. The passage here has a striking resemblance to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a> - <p>"They shall not lament for him, saying,<p>Ah! my brother! or, Ah! sister!<p>They shall not lament for him, saying,<p>Ah! lord! or, Ah! his glory!<p>With the burial of an ass shall he be buried,<p>Drawn out and east beyond the gates of Jerusalem."<p>And his widows shall not weep - The plural here - "widows" - is a proof that polygamy was then practiced. It is probable that Job here alludes to the shrieks of domestic grief which in the East are heard in every part of the house among the females on the death of the master of the family, or to the train of women that usually followed the corpse to the grave. The standing of a man in society was indicated by the length of the train of mourners, and particularly by the number of wives and concubines that followed him as weepers. Job refers to this as the sentiment of his friends, that when a wicked man died, he would die with such evident marks of the divine displeasure, that even his own family would not mourn for him, or that they would be cut off before his death, and none would be left to grieve. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Buried by it implies that they would have none else but the death plague itself (poetically personified) to perform their funeral rites, that is, would have no one.<p>his&#8212;rather, "their widows."

Of the wicked man after his death; or such that remain, and have escaped the sword and famine: <p>shall be buried in death: the pestilence, emphatically called death by the Hebrews, as by us the mortality, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>. This is another of God's sore public judgments wicked men, and is such a kind of death, by reason of the contagion of it, that a person is buried as soon as dead almost, being infectious to keep him; and so Mr. Broughton translates the words, <p>"his remnant shall be buried as soon as they are dead;'' <p>or the disease of which such die being so very infectious sometimes, no one dares to bury them for fear of catching it, and so they lie unburied; which some take to be the sense of the phrase, either that they shall be hurried away to the grave, and so not be embalmed and lie in state, and have an honourable and pompous funeral, or that they shall have none at all, their death will be all the burial they shall have: or else the sense is, they shall die such a death as that death shall be their grave; and they shall have no other, as the men of the old world that were drowned in the flood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-23.htm">Genesis 7:23</a>; and Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>; and Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, who were swallowed up in the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-27.htm">Numbers 16:27</a>; and such as are devoured by wild beasts; and if this last could be thought to be meant, we have all the four sore judgments of God in this verse and <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-14.htm">Job 27:14</a>, sword, famine, pestilence, and evil beasts, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>, <p>and his widows shall not weep; leaving more than one behind him, polygamy being frequent in those times; or else these are his sons' wives, left widows by them, as Bar Tzemach thinks, they being the persons immediately spoken of, dying by various deaths before mentioned; but whether they be his widows, or theirs, they shall weep for neither of them; either because they themselves will be cut off with them; or their husbands dying shameful deaths, lamentation would be forbidden; or they would not be able to weep through the astonishment and stupor they should be seized with at their death; or having lived such miserable and uncomfortable lives with them, they should be so far from lamenting their death, that they should, as Jarchi interprets it, rejoice at it; the Septuagint version is, <p>"no one shall have mercy on their widows.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> shall not weep.</span><p>(l) No one will lament him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">buried in death</span>] “Death” is here, as often (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if they say to you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus said the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm" title="Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.">Jeremiah 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm" title="And when he comes, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.">Jeremiah 43:11</a>) <span class="ital">pestilence</span>.

The old expositors err in many ways respecting <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>, by taking &#1489;&#1510;&#1506;, abscindere (root &#1489;&#1509;), in the sense of (opes) corradere (thus also more recently Rosenm. after the Targ., Syr., and Jer.), and referring &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492; in the signification tranquillum esse (thus even Blumenfeld after Ralbag and others). &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is the object to both verbs, and &#1489;&#1510;&#1506; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, abscindere animam, to cut off the thread of life, is to be explained according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, extrahere animam (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;, whence &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495; Arab. salan, the after-birth, cogn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; .
