It is our wisdom to comfort ourselves, and others, in distress, with that which will not fail; the promise of God, his love and grace, and a well-grounded hope of eternal life. See how Job reconciles himself to the grave. Let this make believers willing to die; it is but going to bed; they are weary, and it is time that they were in their beds. Why should not they go willingly when their Father calls them? Let us remember our bodies are allied to corruption, the worm and the dust; and let us seek for that lively hope which shall be fulfilled, when the hope of the wicked shall be put out in darkness; that when our bodies are in the grave, our souls may enjoy the rest reserved for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My days are past - "I am about to die." Job relapses again into sadness - as he often does. A sense of his miserable condition comes over him like a cloud, and he feels that he must die.<p>My purposes are broken off - All my plans fail, and my schemes of life come to an end. No matter what they could say now, it was all over with him, and he must die; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a> :<p>"My habitation is taken away, and is removed from me<p>Like a shepherd's tent;<p>My life is cut off as by a weaver<p>Who severeth the web from the loom;<p>Between the morning and the night thou wilt make an end of me."<p>Even the thoughts of my heart - Margin, possessions. Noyes, "treasures." Dr. Good, "resolves." Dr. Stock, "the tenants of my heart." Vulgate, "torquen'es cor meum." Septuagint, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  ta arthra te&#772;s kardias mou - the strings of my heart. The Hebrew word (&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;  mo&#770;ra&#770;sh) means properly possession (from &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;  ya&#770;rash, to inherit); and the word here means the dear possessions of his heart; his cherished plans and schemes; the delights of his soul - the purposes which he had hoped to accomplish. All these were now to be broken on by death. This is to man one of the most trying things in death. All his plans must be arrested. His projects of ambition and gain, of pleasure and of fame, of professional eminence and of learning, all are arrested midway. The farmer is compelled to leave his plow in the furrow; the mechanic, his work unfinished; the lawyer, his brief half prepared; the student, his books lying open; the man who is building a palace, leaves it incomplete; and he who is seeking a crown, is taken away when it seemed just within his grasp. How many unfinished plans are caused by death every day! How many unfinished books, sermons, houses, does it make! How many schemes of wickedness and of benevolence, of fraud and of kindness, of gain and of mercy, are daily broken in upon by death! Soon, reader, all your plans and mine will be ended - mine, perhaps, before these lines meet your eye; yours soon afterward. God grant that our purposes of life may be such that we shall be willing to have them broken in upon - all so subordinate to the GREAT PLAN of being prepared for heaven, that we may cheerfully surrender them at any moment, at the call of the Master summoning us into his awful presence! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Or "passed away", or "passed over" (w); not that they passed over the time fixed and appointed by God, for there is no passing the bound settled by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>; but either the common term of man's life was passed with Job, or he speaks of things in his own apprehension; he imagined his death was so near, that he had not a day longer to live; his days, as he before says, were extinct, were at an end, he should never enjoy another day; and therefore it was folly to flatter him with a promise of long life, or encourage him to expect it; which he may mention as a proof of there being not a wise man among them, since they all suggested this in case of repentance; or his meaning is, that his good days, or days of goodness, as Jarchi interprets it, were past; his days of prosperity were at an end, and evil days were come upon him, in which he had no pleasure; nor had he any reason to believe it would be otherwise with him: <p>my purposes are broken off; Job doubtless had formed in his mind great designs of good things, natural, civil; and religious, concerning the enlargement of his temporal estate, the settlement of his children in the world, making provision for the poor, supporting and enlarging the interest of true religion, the reformation of his Heathenish neighbours, and the spread of divine truths among them; but now they were all frustrated, he was not in a capacity of carrying them into execution, and was obliged to drop them, and think no more of them, nor was there with him any prospect of ever renewing them; they were "rooted up" (x), or plucked up, as some render the word, so that there was no likelihood of their ever rising up again, and coming to any effect: <p>even the thoughts of my heart; or "the possessions" (y) of it, as the thoughts are; they are the things of a man, which especially belong to him; they are the inheritance of his mind, what none have a right unto, and a claim upon, but himself, nor can any know but himself, and to whom he discovers them: now the thread of these is broken off at death, they then cease; not that the mind or soul of man ceases to be, or ceases to be a thinking being, it still thinks; but only its thoughts are not employed about the same things in a future state, or in the state after death, as in this, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>. <p>(w) "transierunt", Pagninus, Montanus, &amp;c.

Treated by the friends as a criminal justly undergoing punishment, he seeks his refuge in God, who has set the mark of a horrible disease upon him contrary to his desert, as though he were guilty, and implores Him to confirm the reality of his innocence in some way or other by laying down a pledge for him (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;). The further prayer is &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, as word of entreaty which occurs also in Hezekiah's psalm, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-122.htm">Psalm 119:122</a>; &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; seq. acc. signifies, as noted on the latter passage, to furnish surety for any one, and gen. to take the place of a mediator (comp. also on <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, where &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is a synon. of &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;). Here, however, the significant &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; is added: furnish security for me with Thyself; elsewhere the form is &#1500; &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, to furnish security for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>), or &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; before, any one, here with &#1506;&#1501; of the person by whom the security is to be accepted. The thought already expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a> receives a still stronger expression here: God is conceived of as two persons, on the one side as a judge who treats Job as one deserving of punishment, on the other side as a bondsman who pledges himself for the innocence of the sufferer before the judge, and stands as it were as surety against the future. In the question, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>, the representation is again somewhat changed: Job appears here as the one to whom surety is given. &#1504;&#1514;&#1511;&#1506;, described by expositors as reciprocal, is rather reflexive: to give one's hand (the only instance of the med. form of &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;)  equals  to give surety by striking hands, dextera data sponsionem in se recipere (Hlgst.). And &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; is not to be explained after the analogy of the passive, as the usual &#1500; of the agents: who would allow himself to be struck by my hand, i.e., who would accept the surety from me (Wolfson), which is unnatural both in representation and expression; but it is, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a> (vid., Bertheau), intended of the hand of him who receives the stroke of the hand of him who gives the pledge. This is therefore the meaning of the question: who else (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1502;&#1497;), if not God himself, should strike (his hand) to my hand, i.e., should furnish to me a pledge (viz., of my innocence) by joining hands? There is none but God alone who can intercede for him, as a guarantee of his innocence before himself and others. This negative answer: None but Thou alone, is established in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>. God has closed the heart of the friends against understanding, prop. concealed, i.e., He has fixed a curtain, a wall of partition, between their hearts and the right understanding of the matter; He has smitten them with blindness, therefore He will not (since they are suffering from a want of perception which He has ordained, and which is consequently known to Him) allow them to be exalted, i.e., to conquer and triumph. "The exaltation of the friends," observes Hirzel rightly, "would be, that God should openly justify their assertion of Job's guilt." Lwenthal translates: therefore art thou not honoured; but it is not pointed &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;, but &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;, whether it be that &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; is to be supplied, or that it is equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1502;&#1501; (Ew. 62, a, who, however, prefers to take is as n. Hithpa. like &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1502;&#1501; in the unimproved signification: improvement, since he maintains this affords no right idea), according to the analogy of similar verb-forms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>), by a resolving of the two similar consonants which occur together.<p>The hope thus expressed Job establishes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>) by a principle from general experience, that he who offers his friends as spoil for distribution will be punished most severely for the same upon his children: he shall not escape the divine retribution which visits him, upon his own children, for the wrong done to his friends. Almost all modern expositors are agreed in this rendering of &#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511; as regards <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>; but &#1495;&#1500;&#1511; must not be translated "lot" (Ewald), which it never means; it signifies a share of spoil, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-36.htm">Numbers 31:36</a> (Jerome praedam), or even with a verbal force: plundering (from &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-21.htm">2 Chronicles 28:21</a>), or even in antithesis to entering into bond for a friend with all that one possesses (Stick., Schlottm.), a dividing (of one's property)  equals  distraining, as a result of the surrender to the creditor, to which the verb &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is appropriate, which would then denote denouncing before a court of justice, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>, not merely proclaiming openly, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>. We have translated "spoil," which admits of all these modifications and excludes none; the general meaning is certainly: one deserts (instead of shielding as an intercessor) his friends and delivers them up; &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; with a general subj., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-2.htm">Job 4:2</a> (if any one attempts), <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>. With respect to the other half of the verse, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>, the optative rendering: may they languish (Vaih.), to the adoption of which the old expositors have been misled by parallels like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-9.htm">Psalm 109:9</a>., is to be rejected; it is contrary to the character of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-30.htm">Job 31:30</a>). We agree with Mercerus: Nequaquam hoc per imprecationem, sed ut consequentis justissimae poenae denunciationem ab Iobo dictum putamus. For v. 5b is also not to be taken as a circumstantial clause: even if the eyes of his children languish (Ew., Hlgst. Stick., Hahn, Schl.). It is not &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, but &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;; and before supposing here a Synallage num. so liable to be misunderstood, one must try to get over the difficulty without it, which is here easy enough. Hence Job is made, in the intended application of the general principle, to allude to his own children, and Ewald really considers him the father of infant children, which, however, as may be seen from the prologue, is nothing but an invention unsupported by the history. Since it is &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; and not &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, we refer the suff. to the subj. of &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;. The Waw of &#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; Mich. calls Waw consecutivum; it, however, rather combines things that are inseparable (certainly as cause and effect, sin and punishment). And it is &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, not &#1492;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, because the perf. would describe the fact as past, while the fut. places us in the midst of this faithless conduct. Job says God cannot possibly allow these, his three friends, the upper hand. One proclaims his friends as spoil (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-27.htm">Job 6:27</a>), and the eyes of his children languish (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-20.htm">Job 11:20</a>), i.e., he who so faithlessly disowns the claims of affection, is punished for it on that which he holds most dear. But this uncharitableness which he experiences is also a visitation of God. In the next strophe he refers all that he meets with from man to Him as the final cause, but not without a presage of the purpose for which it is designed. </body></html>
