Literally, they run: <span class= "ital">for a portion he will tell friends. </span>But what is the meaning of this? Some render, “He denounceth his friends for a prey,” <span class= "ital">i.e., such </span>is the conduct of Job’s friends towards Job. Others understand it, “He would say, friends should take their part,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>any one who would undertake to be surety for me would naturally expect my friends to share the responsibility; but so far from this, the eyes of his sons would fail in looking for it; they would never see it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/job/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm" title="He that speaks flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.">Job 17:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">He that speaketh flattery to his friends </span>— “The Hebrew of this verse,” says Peters, “literally, runs thus: <span class="ital">He shall reckon friends for a portion, </span>or <span class="ital">inheritance, and the eyes of his children shall fail; </span>that is, with expectation. They may look their eyes out before they receive any benefit or assistance from these friends. The expression is proverbial, intimating how liable men are to be disappointed, who depend upon the constancy of human friendships. And nothing could be more apposite to Job’s purpose.” Heath renders the words,” <span class="ital">Whoso becometh the accuser of his friends, the eyes of his children will fail; </span>that is, not only he, but his sons after him may look till they be weary, before they get more.” Bishop Patrick’s paraphrase on this and the two preceding verses appears to be perfectly consistent with the context, and is certainly well deserving of the reader’s attention. <span class="ital">Lay down now, </span>&c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm" title="Lay down now, put me in a surety with you; who is he that will strike hands with me?">Job 17:3</a>. “Once more, therefore, I beseech thee, O God, to assure me that thou wilt judge my cause thyself; let somebody undertake for thee; who is it, that on thy behalf will engage to do me right? <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm" title="For you have hid their heart from understanding: therefore shall you not exalt them.">Job 17:4</a>. Not these friends of mine, for they comprehend nothing of the way of thy judgments: therefore thou shalt not confer this honour on them who talk so absurdly. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm" title="He that speaks flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.">Job 17:5</a>. I must speak the truth of them, (though it displease them,) and not sooth them up in their errors: for he that flatters his friends, when he should reprove them, may look long enough before either he, or his children, find one that will deal sincerely with them.” We add also the following interpretation of this verse, proposed by Poole. <span class="ital">“He that uttereth, </span>or <span class="ital">declareth his mind, </span>or <span class="ital">thoughts, with flattery, </span>or <span class="ital">to flatter, </span>or deceive another, he shall be severely punished, not only in his person, but even in his children, whose eyes shall fail with vain expectations of relief, and deliverance out of those calamities which shall come upon them for this sin of their parents.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 Job reflects upon the harsh censures his friends had passed upon him, and, looking on himself as a dying man, he appeals to God. Our time is ending. It concerns us carefully to redeem the days of time, and to spend them in getting ready for eternity. We see the good use the righteous should make of Job's afflictions from God, from enemies, and from friends. Instead of being discouraged in the service of God, by the hard usage this faithful servant of God met with, they should be made bold to proceed and persevere therein. Those who keep their eye upon heaven as their end, will keep their feet in the paths of religion as their way, whatever difficulties and discouragements they may meet with.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that speaketh flattery to his friends - Noyes renders this, "He that delivers up his friend as a prey, the eyes of his children shall fail." So Wemyss, "He who delivers up his friends to plunder." Dr. Good, "He that rebuketh his friends with mildness, even the eyes of his children shall be accomplished." The Septuagint, "He announces evil for his portion; his eyes fail over his sons." The Vulgate, "He promises spoil to his companions, and the eyes of his sons fail." The word rendered "flattery" (&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;  che&#770;leq) properly means "that which is smooth, smoothness" (from &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;  cha&#770;laq to be smooth); and thence it denotes "a lot" or "portion," because "a smooth stone" was anciently used to cast lots in dividing spoils; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-8.htm">Deuteronomy 18:8</a>. Here it is synonymous with plunder or spoil; and the idea is, that he who betrayeth his friends to the spoil or to the spoiler, the eyes of his children shall fail. The meaning in this connection is, that the friends of Job had acted as one would who should announce the residence of his neighbors to robbers, that they might come and plunder them. Instead of defending him, they had acted the part of a traitor. Schultens says that this verse is "a Gordian knot;" and most commentators regard it as such; but the above seems to give a clear and consistent meaning. It is evidently a proverb, and is designed to bear on the professed friends of Job, and to show that they had acted a fraudulent part toward him. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>, he had said that God had hid their heart from understanding, and that wisdom had failed them. He "here" says that in addition to a want of wisdom, they were like a man who should betray his neighbors to robbers.<p>Even the eyes of his children shall fail - He shall be punished. To do this is a crime, and great calamity shall come upon him, represented by the failure of the eyes of his children. Calamity is not unfrequently expressed by the loss of the eyes; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. The Hebrew for "flattery" is "smoothness"; then it came to mean a prey divided by lot, because a smooth stone was used in casting the lots (De 18:8), "a portion" (Ge 14:24). Therefore translate, "He that delivers up his friend as a prey (which the conduct of my friends implies that they would do), even the eyes," &c. [Noyes] (Job 11:20). Job says this as to the sinner's children, retorting upon their reproach as to the cutting off of his (Job 5:4; 15:30). This accords with the Old Testament dispensation of legal retribution (Ex 20:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Hereby Job chargeth them, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

As Job's friends did to him when they promised great outward prosperity, and a restoration to his former state, and to a greater affluence upon his repentance and reformation; or when they spoke deceitfully for God, pretending great regard to the honour of his justice and holiness, and therefore insisted on it that he must be a wicked man and an hypocrite, that was afflicted by him, as Job was: <p>even the eyes of his children shall fail; so hateful are some sins to God, and particularly deceitful tongues, and flattering lips, that he will punish them in their posterity; the eyes of their children shall fail for want of sustenance, and while they are looking in vain for salvation and deliverance out of trouble, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{f}</span> He that speaketh flattery to <i>his</i> friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</span><p>(f) He who flatters a man, and only judges him happy in his prosperity, will not himself only but in his posterity be punished.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. This verse is very obscure. In some way or other it must carry on Job’s severe reflection on the conduct of his friends (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm" title="For you have hid their heart from understanding: therefore shall you not exalt them.">Job 17:4</a></span>), and express it in a stronger way. The word rendered in A.V. <span class="ital">flattery</span> usually means a <span class="ital">portion</span> or share, that which falls to one on a division of land, booty, and the like, or that which is one’s possession. This must be the meaning here. The sense may be,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They give over (their) fellow for a prey,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>While the eyes of his children fail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expression seems to be of the nature of a proverb, which illustrates the cruel treatment to which men are subjected—they are given over, lit. <span class="ital">assigned</span> or <span class="ital">declared</span>, as a prey or possession to others (to whom, as debtors and the like, they are sold), while no pity is had for their perishing children. The language is general, though the conduct of Job’s friends towards him furnishes an illustration of the truth. The word “fellow” is plur., “fellows” or friends, the plur. being used to express the general idea; the sing., referring to each individual, appears in <span class="ital">his</span> children. Job regards his own treatment as an instance of similar ruthlessness, and his friends and those around him as shewing a similar cruelty. The passage expresses a sentiment similar to that in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-27.htm" title="Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless, and you dig a pit for your friend.">Job 6:27</a>. Others render, <span class="ital">he that betrayeth</span> (or, denounceth) <span class="ital">friends for a prey, may the eyes of his children fail</span>, or, <span class="ital">the eyes of his children shall fail</span>. But a malediction or a threat on Job’s part does not suit his tone at this moment, nor the general scope of the passage, in which he is drawing a gloomy picture of his own treatment at the hands of men and God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that speaketh flattery to his friends</span>; rather, he <span class="accented">that denounceth his friends for a prey.</span> Job means to accuse his "comforters" of so acting. By their persistent belief in his grievous wickedness they give him up, as it were, for a prey to calamity, which they pronounce him to have deserved on account of his secret sins. <span class="cmt_word">Even the eyes of his children shall fail</span>. Whoever so acts shall be punished, not only in his own person, but also in the persons of his descendants (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>18  Oh earth, cover thou not my blood,<p>And let my cry find no resting-place!! - <p>19  Even now behold in heaven is my Witness,<p>And One who acknowledgeth me is in the heights!<p>20  Though the mockers of me are my friends - <p>To Eloah mine eyes pour forth tears,<p>21  That He may decide for man against Eloah,<p>And for the son of man against his friend.<p>22  For the years that may be numbered are coming on,<p>And I shall go a way without return.<p>Blood that is not covered up cries for vengeance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-7.htm">Ezekiel 24:7</a>.; so also blood still unavenged is laid bare that it may find vengeance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>. According to this idea, in the lofty consciousness of his innocence, Job calls upon the earth not to suck in his blood as of one innocently slain, but to let it lie bare, thereby showing that it must be first of all avenged ere the earth can take it up; <p>(Note: As, according to the tradition, it is said to have been impossible to remove the stain of the blood of Zachariah the son of Jehoiada, who was murdered in the court of the temple, until it was removed by the destruction of the temple itself.)<p>and for his cry, i.e., the cry (&#1494;&#1506;&#1511;&#1514;&#1497; to be explained according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>) proceeding from his blood as from his poured-out soul, he desires that it may urge its way unhindered and unstilled towards heaven without finding a place of rest (Symm. &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;). Therefore, in the very God who appears to him to be a blood-thirsty enemy in pursuit of him, Job nevertheless hopes to find a witness of his innocence: He will acknowledge his blood, like that of Abel, to be the blood of an innocent man. It is an inward irresistible demand made by his faith which here brings together two opposite principles - principles which the understanding cannot unite - with bewildering boldness. Job believes that God will even finally avenge the blood which His wrath has shed, as blood that has been innocently shed. This faith, which sends forth beyond death itself the word of absolute command contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18</a>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a> brightens and becomes a certain confidence, which draws from the future into the present that acknowledgment which God afterwards makes of him as innocent. The thought of what is unmerited in that decree of wrath which delivers him over to death, is here forced into the background, and in the front stands only the thought of the exaltation of the God in heaven above human short-sightedness, and the thought that no one else but He is the final refuge of the oppressed: even now (i.e., this side of death)<p>(Note: Comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-14.htm">1 Kings 14:14</a>, where it is probably to be explained: Jehovah shall raise up for himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day, but what? even now (&#1490;&#1501; &#1506;&#1514;&#1492;), i.e., He hath raised him up ( equals  but no, even now).)<p>continued...</body></html>
