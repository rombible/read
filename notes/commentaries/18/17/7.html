Our time is ending. It concerns us carefully to redeem the days of time, and to spend them in getting ready for eternity. We see the good use the righteous should make of Job's afflictions from God, from enemies, and from friends. Instead of being discouraged in the service of God, by the hard usage this faithful servant of God met with, they should be made bold to proceed and persevere therein. Those who keep their eye upon heaven as their end, will keep their feet in the paths of religion as their way, whatever difficulties and discouragements they may meet with.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mine eye is dim by reason of sorrow - Schultens supposes that this refers to his external appearance in general, as being worn down, exhausted, "defaced" by his many troubles; but it seems rather to mean that his eyes failed on account of weeping.<p>And all my members are as a shadow - "I am a mere skeleton, I am exhausted and emaciated by my sufferings." It is common to speak of persons who are emaciated by sickness or famine as mere shadows. Thus, Livy (L. 21:40) says, Effigies, imo, "umbrce hominum;" fame, frigore, illuvie, squalore enecti, contusi, debilitati inter saxa rupesque.

The thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-22.htm">Job 16:22</a> is really a concluding thought, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>. Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-1.htm">Job 17:1</a> another strain is taken up; and as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-22.htm">Job 16:22</a> is related, as a confirmation, to the request expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19-21</a>, so <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-1.htm">Job 17:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-2.htm">Job 17:2</a> are related to that expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>. The connection with the conclusion of <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16.htm">Job 16</a> is none the less close: the thoughts move on somewhat crosswise (chiastisch). We do not translate with Ewald: "My spirit is destroyed," because &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500; (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>) signifies not, to be destroyed, but, to be corrupted, disturbed, troubled; not the spirit (after Arab. chbl, usually of disturbance of spirit), but the breath is generally meant, which is become short (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>) and offensive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>), announcing suffocation and decay as no longer far distant. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-1.htm">Job 17:1</a> the &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. &#1504;&#1494;&#1506;&#1499;&#1493;&#1473; is equivalent to &#1504;&#1491;&#1506;&#1499;&#1493;, found elsewhere. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-1.htm">Job 17:1</a> &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is used as if the dead were called, Arab. ssa&#770;chib el-kubu&#770;r, grave-companions. He is indeed one who is dying, from whom the grave is but a step distant, and still the friends promise him long life if he will only repent! This is the mockery which is with him, i.e., surrounds him, as he affirms, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-1.htm">Job 17:1</a>. A secondary verb, &#1492;&#1514;&#1500;, is formed from the Hiph. &#1492;&#1514;&#1500; (of which we had the non-syncopated form of the fut. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-9.htm">Job 13:9</a>), the Piel of which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a> of Elijah's derision of the priests of Baal, and from this is formed the pluralet. &#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (or, according to another reading, &#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, with the same doubling of the &#1500; as in &#1502;&#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, deceitful things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>; comp. the same thing in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-7.htm">Job 33:7</a>, &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, their lions of God  equals  heroes), which has the meaning foolery, - a meaning questioned by Hirz. without right, - in which the idea of deceit and mockery are united. Gecatilia and Ralbag take it as a part.: mockers; Stick., Wolfson, Hahn: deluded; but the analogy of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, and the like, speaks in favour of taking it as a substantive. &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; is affirmative (Ges. 155, 2, f). Ewald renders it as expressive of desire: if only not (Hlgst.: dummodo ne); but this signification (Ew. 329, b) cannot be supported. On the other hand, it might be intended interrogatively (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-25.htm">Job 30:25</a>): annon illusiones mecum (Rosenm.); but this &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488;, corresponding to the second member of a disjunctive question, has no right connection in the preceding. We therefore prefer the affirmative meaning, and explain it like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>. Truly what he continually hears, i.e., from the side of the friends, is only false and delusive utterances, which consequently sound to him like jesting and mockery. The suff. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-2.htm">Job 17:2</a> refers to them. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; (with Dag. dirimens, which renders the sound of the word more pathetic, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-18.htm">Job 9:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17</a>, and in the Hiph. form &#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>), elsewhere generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-18.htm">Joshua 1:18</a> only excepted) of rebellion against God, denotes here the contradictory, quarrelsome bearing of the friends, not the dispute in itself (comp. Arab. mry, III. to attack, VI. to contend with another), but coming forward controversially; only to this is &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1503; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; suitable. &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; must not be taken as  equals  &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; here; Ewald's translation, "only let not mine eye come against their irritation," forces upon this verb, which always signifies to murmur, &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, a meaning foreign to it, and one that does not well suit it here. The voluntative form &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1503;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1503; (here not the pausal form, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-20.htm">Judges 19:20</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-16.htm">2 Samuel 17:16</a>) quite accords with the sense: mine eye shall linger on their janglings; it shall not look on anything that is cheering, but be held fast by this cheerless spectacle, which increases his bodily suffering and his inward pain. From these comforters, who are become his adversaries, Job turns in supplication to God. </body></html>
