It is our wisdom to comfort ourselves, and others, in distress, with that which will not fail; the promise of God, his love and grace, and a well-grounded hope of eternal life. See how Job reconciles himself to the grave. Let this make believers willing to die; it is but going to bed; they are weary, and it is time that they were in their beds. Why should not they go willingly when their Father calls them? Let us remember our bodies are allied to corruption, the worm and the dust; and let us seek for that lively hope which shall be fulfilled, when the hope of the wicked shall be put out in darkness; that when our bodies are in the grave, our souls may enjoy the rest reserved for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But as for you all, do you return - This may mean, either, "return to the debate;" or, "return from your unjust and uncharitable opinion concerning me." The former seems to accord best with the scope of the passage. Tindal renders it, "Get you hence." Dr. Good, "Get ye hence, and begone, I pray." Wemyss, "Repeat your discourses as often as you may, I do not find a wise man among you." It is doubtful, however, whether the Hebrew will bear this construction.<p>For I cannot find one wise man among you - Perhaps the idea here is, "I have not yet found one wise man among you, and you are invited, therefore, to renew the argument. Hitherto you have said nothing that indicates wisdom. Try again, and see if you can say anything now that shall deserve attention." If this is the meaning, it shows that Job was willing to hear all that they had to say, and to give them credit for wisdom, if they ever evinced any. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. return&#8212;If you have anything to advance really wise, though I doubt it, recommence your speech.

This is an address to his three friends, all and everyone of them, who he perceived were nettled with his reply, and were either departing, or preparing for a rejoinder; and being conscious of his innocence, and satisfied of the goodness of his cause, and having nothing to fear from them, boldly challenges them to go on with the dispute; for though they were three to one, he was a match for them all; or else he calls upon them to turn and repent of what they had said to him, to relinquish the bad notions and ill opinion they had of him, and to retract their hard speeches and unjust censures, and return to a friendly and amicable conversation; or however, that they would come and sit down quietly, and patiently hear what he had further to say to them for their information and instruction, which they stood in great need of: <p>for I cannot find one wise man among you; that took his case right, was capable of judging of it, and speaking pertinently to it, and of administering comfort to him in it; they were physicians, but not skilful ones; comforters, but miserable ones; had not the tongue of the learned, to speak a word in season; disputants, but wranglers, and knew not where the pinch of the controversy lay; and their arguments were weak and worthless, and their judgment and sense of things not deserving any regard, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-5.htm">1 Corinthians 6:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But as for <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find <i>one</i> wise <i>man</i> among you.</span><p>(l) Job speaks to the three who came to comfort him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">do ye return, and come</span>] Job bids them renew, if they please, their attempts to solve his problem or deal with his case; as often as they did so they only revealed their incapacity and foolishness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for I cannot find one wise man</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">I shall not find</span>.

Treated by the friends as a criminal justly undergoing punishment, he seeks his refuge in God, who has set the mark of a horrible disease upon him contrary to his desert, as though he were guilty, and implores Him to confirm the reality of his innocence in some way or other by laying down a pledge for him (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;). The further prayer is &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, as word of entreaty which occurs also in Hezekiah's psalm, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-122.htm">Psalm 119:122</a>; &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; seq. acc. signifies, as noted on the latter passage, to furnish surety for any one, and gen. to take the place of a mediator (comp. also on <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, where &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is a synon. of &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;). Here, however, the significant &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; is added: furnish security for me with Thyself; elsewhere the form is &#1500; &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, to furnish security for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>), or &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; before, any one, here with &#1506;&#1501; of the person by whom the security is to be accepted. The thought already expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a> receives a still stronger expression here: God is conceived of as two persons, on the one side as a judge who treats Job as one deserving of punishment, on the other side as a bondsman who pledges himself for the innocence of the sufferer before the judge, and stands as it were as surety against the future. In the question, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>, the representation is again somewhat changed: Job appears here as the one to whom surety is given. &#1504;&#1514;&#1511;&#1506;, described by expositors as reciprocal, is rather reflexive: to give one's hand (the only instance of the med. form of &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;)  equals  to give surety by striking hands, dextera data sponsionem in se recipere (Hlgst.). And &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; is not to be explained after the analogy of the passive, as the usual &#1500; of the agents: who would allow himself to be struck by my hand, i.e., who would accept the surety from me (Wolfson), which is unnatural both in representation and expression; but it is, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a> (vid., Bertheau), intended of the hand of him who receives the stroke of the hand of him who gives the pledge. This is therefore the meaning of the question: who else (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1502;&#1497;), if not God himself, should strike (his hand) to my hand, i.e., should furnish to me a pledge (viz., of my innocence) by joining hands? There is none but God alone who can intercede for him, as a guarantee of his innocence before himself and others. This negative answer: None but Thou alone, is established in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>. God has closed the heart of the friends against understanding, prop. concealed, i.e., He has fixed a curtain, a wall of partition, between their hearts and the right understanding of the matter; He has smitten them with blindness, therefore He will not (since they are suffering from a want of perception which He has ordained, and which is consequently known to Him) allow them to be exalted, i.e., to conquer and triumph. "The exaltation of the friends," observes Hirzel rightly, "would be, that God should openly justify their assertion of Job's guilt." Lwenthal translates: therefore art thou not honoured; but it is not pointed &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;, but &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;, whether it be that &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; is to be supplied, or that it is equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1502;&#1501; (Ew. 62, a, who, however, prefers to take is as n. Hithpa. like &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1502;&#1501; in the unimproved signification: improvement, since he maintains this affords no right idea), according to the analogy of similar verb-forms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>), by a resolving of the two similar consonants which occur together.<p>The hope thus expressed Job establishes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>) by a principle from general experience, that he who offers his friends as spoil for distribution will be punished most severely for the same upon his children: he shall not escape the divine retribution which visits him, upon his own children, for the wrong done to his friends. Almost all modern expositors are agreed in this rendering of &#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511; as regards <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>; but &#1495;&#1500;&#1511; must not be translated "lot" (Ewald), which it never means; it signifies a share of spoil, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-36.htm">Numbers 31:36</a> (Jerome praedam), or even with a verbal force: plundering (from &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-21.htm">2 Chronicles 28:21</a>), or even in antithesis to entering into bond for a friend with all that one possesses (Stick., Schlottm.), a dividing (of one's property)  equals  distraining, as a result of the surrender to the creditor, to which the verb &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is appropriate, which would then denote denouncing before a court of justice, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>, not merely proclaiming openly, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>. We have translated "spoil," which admits of all these modifications and excludes none; the general meaning is certainly: one deserts (instead of shielding as an intercessor) his friends and delivers them up; &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; with a general subj., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-2.htm">Job 4:2</a> (if any one attempts), <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>. With respect to the other half of the verse, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>, the optative rendering: may they languish (Vaih.), to the adoption of which the old expositors have been misled by parallels like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-9.htm">Psalm 109:9</a>., is to be rejected; it is contrary to the character of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-30.htm">Job 31:30</a>). We agree with Mercerus: Nequaquam hoc per imprecationem, sed ut consequentis justissimae poenae denunciationem ab Iobo dictum putamus. For v. 5b is also not to be taken as a circumstantial clause: even if the eyes of his children languish (Ew., Hlgst. Stick., Hahn, Schl.). It is not &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, but &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;; and before supposing here a Synallage num. so liable to be misunderstood, one must try to get over the difficulty without it, which is here easy enough. Hence Job is made, in the intended application of the general principle, to allude to his own children, and Ewald really considers him the father of infant children, which, however, as may be seen from the prologue, is nothing but an invention unsupported by the history. Since it is &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; and not &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, we refer the suff. to the subj. of &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;. The Waw of &#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; Mich. calls Waw consecutivum; it, however, rather combines things that are inseparable (certainly as cause and effect, sin and punishment). And it is &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, not &#1492;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, because the perf. would describe the fact as past, while the fut. places us in the midst of this faithless conduct. Job says God cannot possibly allow these, his three friends, the upper hand. One proclaims his friends as spoil (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-27.htm">Job 6:27</a>), and the eyes of his children languish (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-20.htm">Job 11:20</a>), i.e., he who so faithlessly disowns the claims of affection, is punished for it on that which he holds most dear. But this uncharitableness which he experiences is also a visitation of God. In the next strophe he refers all that he meets with from man to Him as the final cause, but not without a presage of the purpose for which it is designed. </body></html>
