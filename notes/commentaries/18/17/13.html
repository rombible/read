There I am going to rest in a bed where I shall not be disturbed, for which therefore I am preparing myself. In all situations, and amidst all changes, we should keep the grave in view, the bed in which we are shortly to lie, and, by preparation for it, should endeavour to make it easy, namely, by securing peace with God, by keeping our consciences pure, by seeing Christ lying in this bed, and so turning it into a bed of spices, and by looking beyond it to the resurrection.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:10-16 Job's friends had pretended to comfort him with the hope of his return to a prosperous estate; he here shows that those do not go wisely about the work of comforting the afflicted, who fetch their comforts from the possibility of recovery in this world. It is our wisdom to comfort ourselves, and others, in distress, with that which will not fail; the promise of God, his love and grace, and a well-grounded hope of eternal life. See how Job reconciles himself to the grave. Let this make believers willing to die; it is but going to bed; they are weary, and it is time that they were in their beds. Why should not they go willingly when their Father calls them? Let us remember our bodies are allied to corruption, the worm and the dust; and let us seek for that lively hope which shall be fulfilled, when the hope of the wicked shall be put out in darkness; that when our bodies are in the grave, our souls may enjoy the rest reserved for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I wait - Or more accurately, "truly I expect that the grave will be my home." The word rendered "if" (&#1488;&#1501;  '&#305;&#770;m) is often used in such a sense. The meaning is, "I look certainly to the grave as my home. I have made up my mind to it, and have no other expectation."<p>The grave - Hebrew &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;  she'o&#770;l. It may mean here either the grave, or the region of departed spirits, to which he expected soon to descend.<p>Mine house - My home; my permanent abode.<p>I have made my bed - I am certain of making my bed there.

Not that Job put an "if" upon, or made a doubt of waiting upon God in private or public; or of waiting for him, his gracious appearances to him, answers of prayer, performance of promises, and deliverance out of trouble; and especially of waiting his appointed time till his change came, and hoping and expecting eternal life and happiness; all which he determined to do, and did, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; but he says this with respect to the advice of his friends, which should it be taken, the issue of would be no other than what he here suggests; they had intimated, that if he repented and reformed, he might hope for and expect a peaceable tabernacle, and a prosperous habitation, a line house, and affluent circumstances, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24</a>. Now, says he, should I listen to this, and endeavour to cherish some hope and expectation of small things, and put myself in a waiting posture for them, alas! how soon would it be over, for what other house can I rationally expect but the grave? and this is what I have upon; I think of no other house than that, which is man's long home, the house appointed for all living; there I shall dwell, and make my abode until the morning of the resurrection, and I look for no other; and if I should, I am well assured! should be disappointed: <p>I have made my bed in the darkness: in the dark grave, where the light of the body is extinct, and where the light of the sun comes not; in houses there are various apartments, some for work and business, as is the shop; others for eating and drinking, as the dining room; and others for sleep and rest, as the bedchamber; now in the house of the grave there is no mention of any but the latter; for there is no work and device in the grave, nor eating and drinking there; but it is a bed where the weary saint lies down and rests upon from all his toil and labour, until he awakes at the resurrection: now Job had settled the matter with himself, he had laid it out in his own mind, and taken a kind of pleasure in the prospect of it; that he had got a house to move into, when he was dislodged from the earthly house of his tabernacle, and where he had made himself, in his own thought, an easy bed, on which he should lay his weary limbs, and take his sleep and rest, until the heavens be no more. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If I wait, <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> the grave <i>is</i> mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</span><p>(n) Though I should hope to come from adversity to prosperity, as your discourse pretends.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">If I wait, the grave</span>] Rather as above.

We have intentionally chosen an ambiguous expression in the translation, for what Job says can be meant of a wide range of people (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a> ad fin.), as well as of those in the immediate neighbourhood; the friends themselves represent different tribes; and a perishable gipsy-like troglodyte race, to whom Job is become a derision, is specially described further on (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24.htm">Job 24</a>, 30).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a><p>By &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514; (translated by Jer. exemplum, and consequently mistaken for &#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514;) the older expositors are reminded of the name of the place where the sacrifices were offered to Moloch in the valley of the sons of Hinnom (whence &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, hell), since they explain it by "the fire of hell," but only from want of a right perception; the &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; standing with it, which nowhere signifies palam, and cannot here (where &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, although in the signification &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, follows) signify a multo tempore, shows that &#1514;&#1508;&#1514; here is to be derived from &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, to spit out (as &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;, gum, from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;).
