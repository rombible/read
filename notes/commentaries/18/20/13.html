The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth. His hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment of his beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in the heart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The love of the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man sets his heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bring God's judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment of the wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than which nothing is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will all unlawful gains be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through the anxieties of his own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God to restore what was unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy. But to be forced to restore by the horrors of a despairing conscience, as Judas was, has no benefit and comfort attending it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though he spare it - That is, though he retains it long in his mouth, that he may enjoy it the more.<p>And forsake it not - Retains it as long as he can.<p>But keep it still within his mouth - Margin, as in Hebrew "in the midst of his palate."

Not that he feeds sparingly on it, for he eats of it freely and plentifully, with great eagerness and greediness; it designs the gratefulness of it to him; he does not spit it out as loathsome, having tasted of it, but retains it as sweet and pleasant; he spares it as Saul did Agag, and as a man spares his only son; sin being a child, a brat of a wicked man, and therefore it is dear unto him: <p>and forsake it not: as he never will, until he is fully convinced of the evil of it, and it becomes exceeding sinful to him, and so loathsome and disagreeable; and he is restrained from it by the grace of God, and enabled by it to desert it, for such an one only finds mercy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>; <p>but keep it still within his mouth; like an epicure, that will not suffer his food quickly to go down his throat into his stomach, that he may have the greater pleasure in tasting, palating, and relishing it; as Philoxenus, who wished his throat as long as a crane's, that he might be the longer in tasting the sweetness of what he ate and drank; so the wicked man keeps sin within his mouth, not by restraining his mouth from speaking evil, rather by a non-confession of it, but chiefly by continuing and persisting in it, that he might have all the pleasure and satisfaction he has promised himself in it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">forsake it not</span>] i. e. <span class="ital">do not let it go</span>â€”do not swallow it.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  6  If his aspiration riseth to the heavens,<p>And he causeth his head to touch the clouds:<p>  7  Like his dung he perisheth for ever;<p>Those who see him say: Where is he?<p>  8  As a dream he flieth away, and they cannot find him;<p>And he is scared away as a vision of the night.<p>  9  The eye hath seen him, and never again,<p>And his place beholdeth him no more.<p>10  His children must appease the poor,<p>And his hands give up his wealth.<p>11  His bones were full of youthful vigour;<p>Now it is laid down with him in the dust.<p>If the exaltation of the evil-doer rises to heaven, and he causes his head to reach to the clouds, i.e., to touch the clouds, he notwithstanding perishes like his own dung. We are here reminded of what Obadiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-4.htm">Job 20:4</a>, says of Edom, and Isaiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-15</a>, says of the king of Babylon. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; is equivalent to &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488;; the first weak radical is cast away, as in &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;, fraudulentus, machinator, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-5.htm">Isaiah 32:5</a>, and according to Olsh. in &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-33.htm">2 Samuel 19:33</a>. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; is to be understood as causative (at least this is the most natural) in the same manner as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-12.htm">Isaiah 25:12</a>, and freq. It is unnecessary, with Ew., Hirz., and Hlgst., after Schultens, to transl. &#1499;&#1490;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-7.htm">Job 20:7</a>, according to the Arab. jla&#770;l (whence the name Gell-ed-dn): secundum majestatem suam, or with Reiske to read &#1489;&#1490;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;, in magnificentia sua, and it is very hazardous, since the Hebrew &#1490;&#1500;&#1500; has not the meaning of Arab. jll, illustrem esse. Even Schultens, in his Commentary, has retracted the explanation commended in his Animadv., and maintained the correctness of the translation, sicut stercus suum (Jer. sicut sterquilinium), which is also favoured by the similar figurative words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a> : as one burneth up (not: brushes away) dung (&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;), probably cow-dung as fuel, until it is completely gone. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; (or &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; with an audible Shev) may be derived from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, but the analogy of &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; favours the primary form &#1490;&#1468;&#1500; (Ew. 255, b); on no account is it &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;. The word is not low, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>, shows, and the figure, though revolting, is still very expressive; and how the fulfilment is to be thought of may be seen from an example from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>, according to which, "as dung upon the face of the field shall it be, so that they cannot say: this is Jezebel." <p>(Note: In Arabic, gille (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) and gelle (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) is the usual and preferred fuel (hence used as synon. of hhattab) formed of the dung of cows, and not indeed yoke-oxen (baqar 'ammle), because they have more solid fodder, which produces no material for the gelle, but from cattle that pasture in the open fields (baqar bat.tle), which are almost entirely milking cows. This dung is collected by women and children in the spring from the pastures as perfectly dry cakes, which have the green colour of the grass. Every husbandman knows that this kind of dung - the product of a rapid, one might say merely half, digestion, even when fresh, but especially when dry - is perfectly free from smell. What is collected is brought in baskets to the forming or pressing place (mattba'a, &#1502;&#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;), where it is crumbled, then with water made into a thick mass, and, having been mixed with chopped straw, is formed by the women with the hand into round cakes, about a span across, and three fingers thick. They resemble the tanners' tan-cakes, only they are not square. Since this compound has the form of a loaf it is called qurss (which also signifies a loaf of bread); and since a definite form is given to it by the hand, it is called ttabu' (&#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;), collective ttbbi', which &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (&#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;), <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-15.htm">Ezekiel 4:15</a>, resembles in meaning; for ssaf', &#1510;&#1508;&#1506; (cogn. ssafhh, &#1510;&#1508;&#1495;), signifies to beat anything with the palm of the hand. First spread out, then later on piled up, the gelle lies the whole summer in the mattba'a. The domes (qubeb) are not formed until a month before the rainy season, i.e., a circular structure is built up of the cakes skilfully placed one upon another like bricks; it is made from six to eight yards high, gradually narrowed and finished with a vaulted dome, whence this structure has its name, qubbe (&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;). Below it measures about eight or ten paces, it is always hollow, and is filled from beneath by means of an opening which serves as a door. The outside of the qubbe is plastered over with a thick solution of dung; and this coating, when once dried in the sun, entirely protects the building, which is both storehouse and store, against the winter rains. When they begin to use the fuel, they take from the inside first by means of the doorway, and afterwards (by which time the heavy rains are over) they use up the building itself, removing the upper part first by means of a ladder. By the summer the qubbe has disappeared. Many large households have three or four of these stores. Where walled-in courts are spacious, as is generally the case, they stand within; where not, outside. The communities bordering on the desert, and exposed to attacks from the Arabs, place them close round their villages, which gives them a peculiar appearance. When attacked, the herds are driven behind these buildings, and the peasants make their appearance between them with their javelins. Seetzen reckons the gelle among the seven characteristics of the district of Haurn (Basan).<p>continued...</body></html>
