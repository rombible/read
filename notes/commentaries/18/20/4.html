His purpose is to show that it was the settled arrangement of Providence that the wicked would be overtaken with signal calamity. It was "so" settled that Job ought not to be surprised that it had occurred in "his" case. Zophar goes on to show that though a wicked man might rise high in honor, and obtain great wealth, yet that the fall would certainly come, and he would sink to a depth of degradation corresponding to the former prosperity.<p>Since man was placed upon earth - Since the creation; that is, it has always been so. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. check of my reproach&#8212;that is, the castigation intended as a reproach (literally, "shame") to me.<p>spirit of &#8230; understanding&#8212;my rational spirit; answering to "calm thoughts" (Job 20:2).

Moreover, this rendering, as &#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; may also be explained, is in itself contrary to the spirit and plan of the book; for the character of Job's present state of mind is, that he looks for certain death, and will hear nothing of the consolation of recovery (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10-16</a>), which sounds to him as mere mockery; that he, however, notwithstanding, does not despair of God, but, by the consciousness of his innocence and the uncharitableness of the friends, is more and more impelled from the God of wrath and caprice to the God of love, his future Redeemer; and that then, when at the end of the course of suffering the actual proof of God's love breaks through the seeming manifestation of wrath, even that which Job had not ventured to hope is realized: a return of temporal prosperity beyond his entreaty and comprehension.<p>On the other hand, the mode of interpretation of the older translators and expositors, who find an expression of the hope of a resurrection at the end of the preceding strophe or the beginning of this, cannot be accepted.
