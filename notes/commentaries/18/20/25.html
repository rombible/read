There is no fence against this, but in Christ, who is the only Covert from the storm and tempest, Isa 32:2. Zophar concludes, This is the portion of a wicked man from God; it is allotted him. Never was any doctrine better explained, or worse applied, than this by Zophar, who intended to prove Job a hypocrite. Let us receive the good explanation, and make a better application, for warning to ourselves, to stand in awe and sin not. One view of Jesus, directed by the Holy Spirit, and by him suitably impressed upon our souls, will quell a thousand carnal reasonings about the suffering of the faithful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is drawn - Or rather, "he draws" - that is, he draws out the arrow that has been shot at him; or it may mean, as Prof. Lee supposes, that he draws, that is, "someone" draws the arrow from its quiver, or the sword from its sheath, in order to smite him. The object is to describe his death, and to show that he should be certainly overtaken with calamity. Zophar, therefore, goes through the process by which he would be shot down, or shows that he could not escape.<p>And cometh out of the body - That is, the arrow, or the glittering blade.

But the word may as well signify <span class="ital">the bright</span> and <span class="ital">sharp point of an arrow</span>, of which he spoke hitherto; and having in the general said that it <span class="ital">came out of his body</span>, now he determines the part of the body, <span class="ital">the gall</span>; which showeth that the wound was both deep and deadly, as they are in that part. It is probable he mentions this in reference to the like expression of Job, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm" title="His archers compass me round about, he splits my reins asunder, and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.">Job 16:13</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cometh out of his gall; </span> into which it had entered, and wherewith it was coloured. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Terrors are upon him, </span> to wit, the terrors of death, because he perceived by the tincture of his gall upon the weapon that his wound was incurable; or horrors of conscience, because he cannot live, and dare not die. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It is drawn, and cometh out of the body,.... That is, the arrow with which a wicked man is stricken through; either it is drawn, and comes out of the quiver, as Broughton; or rather is drawn out of the body of a wicked man, being shot into it, and that in order that he may be cured of his wound if possible, but to no purpose, since it follows: <p>yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall; being thrust into it, which being pierced and poured out, is certain and immediate death, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>. Some render it, yea, "the glittering sword out of his gall, he shall go away", or "is gone" (f); that is, he shall die, or is a dead man, there is no hope of him, when the arrow has transfixed his body, and the sword has penetrated into his gall, and divided that: <p>terrors are upon him; the terrors of death, the plain symptoms of it being upon him; the terrors of an awful judgment, which follows after it; the terrors of the dreadful sentence of condemnation that will then be pronounced, "go, ye cursed", &amp;c. and the terrors of hell and eternal death, signified by utter darkness, unquenchable fire, and the never ceasing torments of it. Some by them understand devils, those terrible spirits which haunt wicked men in their dying moments, and are ready to carry them to the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, where they are to be companions with them for ever. The word is sometimes used of gigantic persons, who are sometimes terrible to others; and since these are mentioned along with weapons of war, Bar Tzemach interprets them of men of strength and power, men of war or soldiers, whose fear falls on others. <p>(f) "abibit e vivis"; so some in Michaelis; "abit", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It is drawn, and cometh out of the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors <i>are</i> upon him.</span><p>(n) Some read, of the quiver.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">It is drawn</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">he draweth it forth</span>—that is, the arrow (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-24.htm" title="He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.">Job 20:24</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the glistering sword</span>] Rather, the glittering <span class="bld">shaft</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm" title="And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;">Isaiah 49:2</a>), or, more generally, the glittering steel; what is meant is the arrow that strikes the sinner through (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-24.htm" title="He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.">Job 20:24</a></span>). He draws it out hoping to save himself, not knowing that he is mortally stricken, but with the drawing of it out there fall on him the terrors of death. The picture, particularly the last isolated sentence “terrors are upon him,” is graphic.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is drawn, and cometh out of the body</span>; rather, he <span class="accented">draweth it forth</span> <span class="accented">and it cometh out of his</span> body (see the Revised Version).
