The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth. His hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment of his beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in the heart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The love of the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man sets his heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bring God's judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment of the wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than which nothing is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will all unlawful gains be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through the anxieties of his own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God to restore what was unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy. But to be forced to restore by the horrors of a despairing conscience, as Judas was, has no benefit and comfort attending it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because he hath oppressed - Margin, "crushed." Such is the Hebrew.<p>And forsaken the poor - He has plundered them, and then forsaken them - as robbers do. The meaning is, that he had done this by his oppressive manner of dealing, and then left them to suffer and pine in want.<p>He hath violently taken away an house which he builded not - That is, by overreaching and harsh dealings he has come in possession of dwellings which he did not build, or purchase in any proper manner. It does not mean that he had done this by violence - for Zophar is not describing a robber, but he means that he took advantage of the needs of the poor and obtained their property. This is often done still. A rich man takes advantage of the needs of the poor, and obtains their little farm or house for much less than it is worth. He takes a mortgage, and then forecloses it, and buys the property himself for much less than its real value, and thus practices a species of the worst kind of robbery. Such a man, Zophar says, must expect punishment - and if there is any man who has occasion to dread the wrath of heaven it is he. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. oppressed&#8212;whereas he ought to have espoused their cause (2Ch 16:10).<p>forsaken&#8212;left helpless.<p>house&#8212;thus leaving the poor without shelter (Isa 5:8; Mic 2:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By his oppression he brought men to utter poverty, and then forsook or left them in that forlorn estate, affording no mercy nor help to them.

Having oppressed, crushed, and broken the poor to pieces, he leaves them so without pity and compassion for them, and without giving them any relief; he first by oppression makes them poor, or however poorer still, and then leaves them in such circumstances; for this does not suppose that he once was a favourer of them, and afforded them assistance in their necessities, and afterwards forsook them; but rather, as Ben Gersom gives the sense, he does not leave the poor until he has oppressed and crushed them, and then he does; Mr. Broughton's reading of the words agrees with the former sense, "he oppresseth and leaveth poor": <p>because he hath violently taken away an house which he built not; an house which did not belong to him, he had no property in or right unto, which, as he had not bought, he had not built; and therefore could lay no rightful claim unto it, and yet this he took in a violent manner from the right owner of it, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>; or "and", or "but shall not build it" (a), or "buildeth it not"; he took it away with an intention to pull it down, and build a stately palace in the room of it; but either his substance was taken from him, or he taken away by death before he could finish it, and so either through neglect, or want of opportunity, or of money, did not what he thought to have done. <p>(a)  "et non aedificabit eam", Pagninus, Montanus; "et non aedificat eam", Cocceius, Schultens; "non autem", Beza; "sed non", Schmidt, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">and hath forsaken</span>] Abandoned them, after oppressing them, to their destitution.

These charges are now for the first time insinuated against Job; later on, they are openly brought by Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-9</a>). Job denies them categorically in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-11.htm">Job 29:11-17</a>. They seem to have been pure calumnies, without an atom of foundation. Because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not. Another calumny, doubtless. Something like it was insinuated by Eliphaz in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-28.htm">Job 15:28</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  If wickedness tasted sweet in his mouth,<p>He hid it under his tongue;<p>13  He carefully cherished it and did not let it go,<p>And retained it in his palate:<p>14  His bread is now changed in his bowels,<p>It is the gall of vipers within him.<p>15  He hath swallowed down riches and now he spitteth them out,<p>God shall drive them out of his belly.<p>16  He sucked in the poison of vipers,<p>The tongue of the adder slayeth him.<p>The evil-doer is, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-12.htm">Job 20:12</a>, likened to an epicure; he keeps hold of wickedness as long as possible, like a delicate morsel that is retained in the mouth (Renan: comme un bonbon qu'on laisse fondre dans la bouche), and seeks to enjoy it to the very last. &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, to make sweet, has here the intransitive signification dulcescere, Ew. 122, c. &#1492;&#1499;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;, to remove from sight, signifies elsewhere to destroy, here to conceal (as the Piel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-18.htm">Job 15:18</a>). &#1495;&#1502;&#1500;, to spare, is construed with &#1506;&#1500;, which is usual with verbs of covering and protecting.

The following fut. consec. is here not aor., but expressive of the inevitable result which the performance of an act assuredly brings: he must vomit back the property which he has swallowed down; God casts it out of his belly, i.e., (which is implied in &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;, expellere) forcibly, and therefore as by the pains of colic.
