The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth. His hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment of his beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in the heart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The love of the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man sets his heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bring God's judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment of the wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than which nothing is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will all unlawful gains be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through the anxieties of his own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God to restore what was unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy. But to be forced to restore by the horrors of a despairing conscience, as Judas was, has no benefit and comfort attending it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet his meat - His food.<p>In his bowels is turned - That is, it is as if he had taken food which was exceedingly pleasant, and had retained it in his mouth as long as possible, that he might enjoy it, but when he swallowed it, it became bitter and offensive; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9-10</a>. Sin may be pleasant when it is committed, but its consequences will be bitter.<p>It is the gall of asps - On the meaning of the word here rendered "asps" (&#1508;&#1514;&#1503;  pethen), see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>. There can be little doubt that the "asp," or aspic, of antiquity, which was so celebrated, is here intended. The bite was deadly, and was regarded as incurable. The sight became immediately dim after the bite - a swelling took place, and pain was felt in the stomach, followed by stupor, convulsions, and death. It is probably the same as the "boetan" of the Arabians. It is about a foot in length, and two inches in circumference - its color being black and white. "Pict. Bib." The word "gall" (&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;  mero&#770;ra&#770;h), means "bitterness, acridness" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>); and hence, bile or gall. It is not improbable that it was formerly supposed that the poison of the serpent was contained in the gall, though it is now ascertained that it is found in a small sack in the mouth. It is used here as synonymous with the "poison" of asps - supposed to be "bitter" and "deadly." The meaning is, that sin, however pleasant and grateful it may be when committed, will be as destructive to the soul as food would be to the body, which, as soon as it was swallowed, became the most deadly poison. This is a fair account still of the effects of sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. turned&#8212;Hebrew denotes a total change into a disagreeable contrary (Jer 2:21; compare Re 10:9, 10).<p>gall&#8212;in which the poison of the asp was thought to lie.

Or "his bread" (r), to which sin is compared, being what the sinner lives in, and lives upon; what he strengthens himself in and with, and by which he is nourished unto the day of slaughter, and by means of which he grows and proceeds to more ungodliness, though in the issue he comes into starving and famishing circumstances; for this is bread of deceit, and proves to be ashes and gravel stones; it promises pleasure, profit, liberty, and impunity, but is all the reverse; as meat turns in a man's stomach when it does not digest in him, or rather his stomach turns against that, and instead of its being pleasant and agreeable to him, it distresses him and makes him uneasy; sin being compared to meat in the bowels, denotes the finishing of in after it has been conceived in the mind, and completed in the act: <p>it is the gall of asps within him; which is bitter, though not poison; which yet Pliny (s) suggests, but it seems (t) it is not fact. Sin is an evil and bitter thing, and produces bitter sorrow, and makes bitter work for repentance in good men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>; and fills with distress inexpressible and intolerable in wicked men, as in Cain and Judas in this world, and with black despair, weeping, and gnashing of teeth, and dreadful horrors of conscience, in the world to come, to all eternity; the effect of it is eternal death, the second death, inevitable and everlasting ruin and destruction. <p>(r) "panis ejus", Pagninus, Montanus, Beza, Schmidt.

Still, a time comes when the self-complacency of the wicked man is shaken. He experiences a failure of health or spirits. Then, suddenly, it is as if the meat that he has swallowed had been turned to poison in his bowels, as if the gall of asps were within him. Compare what Bishop Butler says of the sudden waking up of a man's conscience ('Analogy,' pt. 1. ch. 2. p. 52). The ancients seem to have known that the poison of serpents was a strong acid, and therefore supposed that it was secreted by the gallbladder (see Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 11:37). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  6  If his aspiration riseth to the heavens,<p>And he causeth his head to touch the clouds:<p>  7  Like his dung he perisheth for ever;<p>Those who see him say: Where is he?<p>  8  As a dream he flieth away, and they cannot find him;<p>And he is scared away as a vision of the night.<p>  9  The eye hath seen him, and never again,<p>And his place beholdeth him no more.<p>10  His children must appease the poor,<p>And his hands give up his wealth.<p>11  His bones were full of youthful vigour;<p>Now it is laid down with him in the dust.<p>If the exaltation of the evil-doer rises to heaven, and he causes his head to reach to the clouds, i.e., to touch the clouds, he notwithstanding perishes like his own dung. We are here reminded of what Obadiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-4.htm">Job 20:4</a>, says of Edom, and Isaiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-15</a>, says of the king of Babylon. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; is equivalent to &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488;; the first weak radical is cast away, as in &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;, fraudulentus, machinator, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-5.htm">Isaiah 32:5</a>, and according to Olsh. in &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-33.htm">2 Samuel 19:33</a>. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; is to be understood as causative (at least this is the most natural) in the same manner as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-12.htm">Isaiah 25:12</a>, and freq. It is unnecessary, with Ew., Hirz., and Hlgst., after Schultens, to transl. &#1499;&#1490;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-7.htm">Job 20:7</a>, according to the Arab. jla&#770;l (whence the name Gell-ed-dn): secundum majestatem suam, or with Reiske to read &#1489;&#1490;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;, in magnificentia sua, and it is very hazardous, since the Hebrew &#1490;&#1500;&#1500; has not the meaning of Arab. jll, illustrem esse. Even Schultens, in his Commentary, has retracted the explanation commended in his Animadv., and maintained the correctness of the translation, sicut stercus suum (Jer. sicut sterquilinium), which is also favoured by the similar figurative words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a> : as one burneth up (not: brushes away) dung (&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;), probably cow-dung as fuel, until it is completely gone. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; (or &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; with an audible Shev) may be derived from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, but the analogy of &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; favours the primary form &#1490;&#1468;&#1500; (Ew. 255, b); on no account is it &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;. The word is not low, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>, shows, and the figure, though revolting, is still very expressive; and how the fulfilment is to be thought of may be seen from an example from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>, according to which, "as dung upon the face of the field shall it be, so that they cannot say: this is Jezebel." <p>(Note: In Arabic, gille (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) and gelle (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) is the usual and preferred fuel (hence used as synon. of hhattab) formed of the dung of cows, and not indeed yoke-oxen (baqar 'ammle), because they have more solid fodder, which produces no material for the gelle, but from cattle that pasture in the open fields (baqar bat.tle), which are almost entirely milking cows. This dung is collected by women and children in the spring from the pastures as perfectly dry cakes, which have the green colour of the grass. Every husbandman knows that this kind of dung - the product of a rapid, one might say merely half, digestion, even when fresh, but especially when dry - is perfectly free from smell. What is collected is brought in baskets to the forming or pressing place (mattba'a, &#1502;&#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;), where it is crumbled, then with water made into a thick mass, and, having been mixed with chopped straw, is formed by the women with the hand into round cakes, about a span across, and three fingers thick. They resemble the tanners' tan-cakes, only they are not square. Since this compound has the form of a loaf it is called qurss (which also signifies a loaf of bread); and since a definite form is given to it by the hand, it is called ttabu' (&#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;), collective ttbbi', which &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (&#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;), <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-15.htm">Ezekiel 4:15</a>, resembles in meaning; for ssaf', &#1510;&#1508;&#1506; (cogn. ssafhh, &#1510;&#1508;&#1495;), signifies to beat anything with the palm of the hand. First spread out, then later on piled up, the gelle lies the whole summer in the mattba'a. The domes (qubeb) are not formed until a month before the rainy season, i.e., a circular structure is built up of the cakes skilfully placed one upon another like bricks; it is made from six to eight yards high, gradually narrowed and finished with a vaulted dome, whence this structure has its name, qubbe (&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;). Below it measures about eight or ten paces, it is always hollow, and is filled from beneath by means of an opening which serves as a door. The outside of the qubbe is plastered over with a thick solution of dung; and this coating, when once dried in the sun, entirely protects the building, which is both storehouse and store, against the winter rains. When they begin to use the fuel, they take from the inside first by means of the doorway, and afterwards (by which time the heavy rains are over) they use up the building itself, removing the upper part first by means of a ladder. By the summer the qubbe has disappeared. Many large households have three or four of these stores. Where walled-in courts are spacious, as is generally the case, they stand within; where not, outside. The communities bordering on the desert, and exposed to attacks from the Arabs, place them close round their villages, which gives them a peculiar appearance. When attacked, the herds are driven behind these buildings, and the peasants make their appearance between them with their javelins. Seetzen reckons the gelle among the seven characteristics of the district of Haurn (Basan).<p>continued...</body></html>
