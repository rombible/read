Ewald observes: "&#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; stands without addition, because this is easily understood from the &#1499;&#1503; in &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;." But although this ellipsis is not inadmissible (comp. &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;  equals  &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-25.htm">Job 34:25</a>; &#1499;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>), in spite of it <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-2.htm">Job 20:2</a> furnishes no meaning that can be accepted. Most expositors translate: "and hence the storm within me" (thus e.g., Ewald); but the signification perturbatio animi, proposed by Schultens for &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, after the Arab. h&#803;a&#770;s&#780;, is too remote from the usage of Hebrew. Moreover, this Arab. h&#803;a&#770;s&#780; signifies prop. to scare, hunt, of game; not, however: to be agitated, to storm, - a signification which even the corresponding Hebr. &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, properare, does not support. Only a few expositors (as Umbreit, who translates: because of my storm within me) take &#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; (which occurs only this once in the book of Job) as praepos., as it must be taken in consideration of the infin. which follows (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3</a>). Further, &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; (only by Umbreit translated by "yet," after the Arab. la&#770;kin, la&#770;kinna, which it never signifies in Hebr., where &#1500; is not  equals  &#1500;&#1488;, but  equals  &#1500; with Kametz before the tone) with that which follows is referred by several expositors to the preceding speech of Job, e.g., Hahn: "under such circumstances, if thou behavest thus;" by most, however, it is referred to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-3.htm">Job 20:3</a>, e.g., Ew.: "On this account he feels called upon by his thoughts to answer, and hence his inward impulse leaves him no rest: because he hears from Job a contemptuous wounding reproof of himself." In other words: in consequence of the reproach which Job casts upon him, especially with his threat of judgment, Zophar's mind and feelings fall into a state of excitement, and give him an answer to which he now gives utterance. This prospective sense of &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; may at any rate be retained, though &#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; is taken as a preposition (wherefore ... and indeed on account of my inward commotion); but it is far more natural that the beginning of Zophar's speech should be connected with the last word of Job's. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-2.htm">Job 20:2</a> may really be so understood if we connect &#1495;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, not with Arab. h&#803;a&#770;s&#780;, &#1495;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, to excite, to make haste (after which also Saad. and Aben-Ezra: on account of my inward hastening or urging), but with Arab. h&#803;s, to feel; in this meaning chsh is usual in all the Semitic dialects, and is even biblical also; for <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:25</a> is to be translated: who hath feeling (pleasure) except from Him (read &#1502;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;)? i.e., even in pleasure man is not free, but has conditions fixed by God.<p>With &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; (used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>) Zophar draws an inference from Job's conduct, esp. from the turn which his last speech has taken, which, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;<p>(Note: Thus it is to be read according to the Masoretic note, &#1493;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1497;&#1514; (i.e., plene, as nowhere else), which occurs in Codd., as is also attested by Kimchi in his Gramm., Moznajim, p. 8; Aben-Ezra in his Gramm., Zachoth 1, b; and the punctuator Jekuthil, in his Darche ha-Nikkud (chapter on the letters &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;).)<p>affirms, urges him involuntarily and irresistibly forward, and indeed, as he adds with Waw explic.: on account of the power of feeling dwelling in him, by which he means both his sense of truth and his moral feeling, in general the capacity of direct perception, not perception that is only attained after long reflection.

S. 154, f), answers him from the perception which is peculiar to himself, i.e., out of the fulness of this perception it furnishes him with information as to what is to be thought of Job with his insulting attacks, viz., (this is the substance of the &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; of the thoughts, and of the &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; of the spirit), that in this conduct of Job only his godlessness is manifest. This is what he warningly brings against him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-4.htm">Job 20:4</a> : knowest thou indeed (which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>, sarcastically is equivalent to: thou surely knowest, or in astonishment: what dost thou not know?!) this from the beginning, i.e., this law, which has been in operation from time immemorial (or as Ew.: hoccine scis aeternum esse, so that &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1491; is not a virtual adj., but virtual predicate-acc.), since man was placed (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; infin., therefore prop., since one has placed man) upon the earth (comp. the model passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-32.htm">Deuteronomy 4:32</a>), that the exulting of the wicked is &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;, from near, i.e., not extending far, enduring only a short time (Arab. qr&#305;&#770;b often directly signifies brevis); and the joy of the godless &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1490;&#1506;, only for a moment, and continuing no longer? </body></html>
