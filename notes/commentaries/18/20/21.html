The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth. His hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment of his beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in the heart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The love of the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man sets his heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bring God's judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment of the wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than which nothing is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will all unlawful gains be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through the anxieties of his own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God to restore what was unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy. But to be forced to restore by the horrors of a despairing conscience, as Judas was, has no benefit and comfort attending it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"There shall none of his meat be left Margin, "or, be none left for his meat." Noyes renders it, "Because nothing escaped his greatness." Prof. Lee, "no surviver shall remain for his provision." But the meaning, probably, is, nothing shall remain of his food, or it shall all be wasted, or dissipated.<p>Therefore, shall no man look for his goods - Or rather, his goods or his property shall not endure. But a great variety of interpretations has been given to the passage. The Hebrew word rendered "shall look," &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  ya&#772;ch&#305;&#770;yl, is from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  chu&#770;l, which means, "to turn round, to twist, to whirl;" and thence, arises the notion of being firm, stable, or strong - as a rope that is twisted is strong. That is the idea here; and the sense is, that his property should not be secure or firm; or that he should not prosper. Jerome renders it, "Nothing shall remain of his goods." The Septuagint, "Therefore his good things - &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;  autou ta agatha - shall not flourish" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  anthe&#772;sei. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. look for&#8212;rather, "because his goods," that is, prosperity shall have no endurance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">None of his meat be left</span> for his own future use; but he shall be stripped of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore shall no man look for his goods; </span> it being publicly known and observed that he was totally ruined, none of his kindred or friends shall trouble themselves to seek for any relics of his estate, as is usually done after men’s deaths.

Scarcely intended literally, as Canon Cook supposes. Rather said in reference to the wicked man's persistent oppression and robbery of the poor, the needy, and the powerless (comp. vers. 19, 20; and note our Lord's words, "Ye <span class="accented">devour</span> widows' houses," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall no man look for his goods</span>. This is an impossible rendering. Translate, with Rosenmuller, Canon Cook, Stanley Leathes, and our Revisers, <span class="accented">therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</span> In other words, a Nemesis shall overtake him. For his oppression and cruelty he shall be visited by the Divine auger; a sudden end shall be made of his prosperity, and he shall fall into penury and misfortune. Covert allusion is, no doubt, intended to Job's sudden loss of his extraordinary prosperity by the series of calamities so graphically portrayed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13-19</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  If wickedness tasted sweet in his mouth,<p>He hid it under his tongue;<p>13  He carefully cherished it and did not let it go,<p>And retained it in his palate:<p>14  His bread is now changed in his bowels,<p>It is the gall of vipers within him.<p>15  He hath swallowed down riches and now he spitteth them out,<p>God shall drive them out of his belly.<p>16  He sucked in the poison of vipers,<p>The tongue of the adder slayeth him.<p>The evil-doer is, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-12.htm">Job 20:12</a>, likened to an epicure; he keeps hold of wickedness as long as possible, like a delicate morsel that is retained in the mouth (Renan: comme un bonbon qu'on laisse fondre dans la bouche), and seeks to enjoy it to the very last. &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, to make sweet, has here the intransitive signification dulcescere, Ew. 122, c. &#1492;&#1499;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;, to remove from sight, signifies elsewhere to destroy, here to conceal (as the Piel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-18.htm">Job 15:18</a>). &#1495;&#1502;&#1500;, to spare, is construed with &#1506;&#1500;, which is usual with verbs of covering and protecting.
