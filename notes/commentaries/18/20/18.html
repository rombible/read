It may refer either to the goods of others, of which he had obtained possession, not without pains and difficulty; or to his own goods, honestly gotten by the sweat of his brow. And this may be intended as an aggravation of his misery, that he is compelled, not only to restore other men’s goods, which were in his hands, but to part with his own also, to make reparation for damages. <span class="ital">And shall not swallow it down — </span>So as to hold it: he shall not possess it long, nor to any important purpose. <span class="ital">According to his substance shall the restitution be</span> — That is, he shall be forced to part with all his property to make compensation for his wrongs. <span class="ital">And he shall not rejoice therein — </span>He shall not enjoy what he had gotten, because it shall be taken from him. Houbigant’s translation of this verse is, <span class="ital">He shall restore what he gained by his labour, and shall not consume it. His merchandise was abundant, but he shall not enjoy it.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:10-22 The miserable condition of the wicked man in this world is fully set forth. The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth. His hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment of his beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in the heart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The love of the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man sets his heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bring God's judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment of the wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than which nothing is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will all unlawful gains be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through the anxieties of his own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God to restore what was unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy. But to be forced to restore by the horrors of a despairing conscience, as Judas was, has no benefit and comfort attending it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That which he laboured for shall he restore - This means that he shall give back the profit of his labor. He shall not be permitted to enjoy it or to consume it.<p>And shall not swallow it down - Shall not enjoy it; shall not eat it. He shall be obliged to give it to others.<p>According to his substance shall the restitution be - literally, according to Gesenius, "As a possession to be restored in which one rejoices not." The sense is, that all that he has is like property which a man has, which he feels not to be his own, but which belongs to another and which is soon to be given "up." In such property a man does not find that pleasure which he does in that which he feels to be his own. He cannot dispose of it, and he cannot look on it and feel that it is his. So Zophar says it is with the wicked man. He can look on his property only as that which he will soon be compelled to part with, and not having any security for retaining it, he cannot rejoice in it as if it were his own. Dr. Lee, however, renders this, "As his wealth is, so shall his restitution be; and he shall not rejoice." But the interpretation proposed above, seems to me to accord best with the sense of the Hebrew. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

This explains what was before figuratively expressed by vomiting, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-15.htm">Job 20:15</a>; and is to be interpreted either of that which another laboured for; so the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"another's labour;'' <p>and Mr. Broughton renders it, "he shall restore what man's pain get": and then the sense is, that that which another got by his labour, coming by some means or another into the hand of this rapacious, covetous, wicked man, he shall be obliged to restore to him again; or the hire of the labourer being detained in his hands, he shall be forced to give it to him, as the Egyptians, by lending the Israelites their jewels of gold and silver, restored to them the wages due to them for all their labour among them for many years; or else this is to be understood of what the wicked man himself had laboured for, who with much toil and labour, as well as trick and artifice, had got the wealth of others into his hands; but should be obliged to make restoration of it again, and along with that also what he had laboured for, and had got even in an honest and lawful way, the marathon of unrighteousness corrupting and marring his whole substance: <p>and shall not swallow it down; or "not have time to devour it", as Mr. Broughton; he shall be obliged so soon to restore it, that it shall be as if he had never had it; he shall have no enjoyment of it, at least no comfort, pleasure, and satisfaction in it: <p>according to his substance shall the restitution be; the law of Moses required, in some cases, fourfold, in others fivefold, and sometimes sevenfold was exacted; and if a man had not sufficient to pay, all his substance was to go towards payment, and by this means what he lawfully got went along with that which was obtained in an illicit way, as before, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>; <p>and he shall not rejoice therein; not in the restitution he is forced to make, it being greatly against his will; nor in his ill-gotten substance, at least but for a little while, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>; he shall neither enjoy it nor have delight and pleasure in it, nor glory of it, as men are apt to do; Mr. Broughton reads this in connection with the preceding clause thus, <p>"and never rejoice in the wealth for which he must make recompense.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow <i>it</i> down: according to <i>his</i> substance <i>shall</i> the restitution <i>be</i>, <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> and he shall not rejoice <i>therein</i>.</span><p>(i) That is these raveners and spoilers of the poor will enjoy their theft but for a time for after God will take it from them, and cause them to make restitution so that it is only an exchange.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">That which he laboured for</span>] i. e. that which he has acquired—the fruit of his labour; this he shall restore and shall not swallow down, or enjoy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to his substance</span>] This half verse reads: according to the wealth which he has gotten he shall not rejoice, lit. <span class="ital">according to the wealth of his exchange</span> (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm" title="Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense.">Job 15:31</a>).

So Schultens, Professor Lee, and Dr. Stanley Leathes, who understand Zophar as asserting that, in order to compensate those whom he has robbed, the wicked man will have to make over to them all the wealth that is honestly his Others translate, "According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice" (see the Revised Version, and the commentaries of Ewald, Delitzsch, and Dillmann). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  If wickedness tasted sweet in his mouth,<p>He hid it under his tongue;<p>13  He carefully cherished it and did not let it go,<p>And retained it in his palate:<p>14  His bread is now changed in his bowels,<p>It is the gall of vipers within him.<p>15  He hath swallowed down riches and now he spitteth them out,<p>God shall drive them out of his belly.<p>16  He sucked in the poison of vipers,<p>The tongue of the adder slayeth him.<p>The evil-doer is, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-12.htm">Job 20:12</a>, likened to an epicure; he keeps hold of wickedness as long as possible, like a delicate morsel that is retained in the mouth (Renan: comme un bonbon qu'on laisse fondre dans la bouche), and seeks to enjoy it to the very last. &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, to make sweet, has here the intransitive signification dulcescere, Ew. 122, c. &#1492;&#1499;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;, to remove from sight, signifies elsewhere to destroy, here to conceal (as the Piel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-18.htm">Job 15:18</a>). &#1495;&#1502;&#1500;, to spare, is construed with &#1506;&#1500;, which is usual with verbs of covering and protecting.

The bitter and poisonous are synonymous in the ancient languages; hence we find the meanings poison and gall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-25.htm">Job 20:25</a>) in &#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1492;, and &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; signifies both a poisonous plant which is known by its bitterness, and the poison of plants like to the poison of serpents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-16.htm">Job 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a>). &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-15.htm">Job 20:15</a>) is property, without the accompanying notion of forcible acquisition (Hirz.), which, on the contrary, is indicated by the &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;. The following fut. consec. is here not aor., but expressive of the inevitable result which the performance of an act assuredly brings: he must vomit back the property which he has swallowed down; God casts it out of his belly, i.e., (which is implied in &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;, expellere) forcibly, and therefore as by the pains of colic.
