There is no fence against this, but in Christ, who is the only Covert from the storm and tempest, Isa 32:2. Zophar concludes, This is the portion of a wicked man from God; it is allotted him. Never was any doctrine better explained, or worse applied, than this by Zophar, who intended to prove Job a hypocrite. Let us receive the good explanation, and make a better application, for warning to ourselves, to stand in awe and sin not. One view of Jesus, directed by the Holy Spirit, and by him suitably impressed upon our souls, will quell a thousand carnal reasonings about the suffering of the faithful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The heaven shall reveal his iniquity - The meaning here is, that the whole creation would conspire against such a man. Heaven and earth would be arrayed against him. The course of events would be so ordered as to seem designed to bring his character out, and to show what he was. He would attempt to conceal his sin, but it would be in vain. He would hide it in his bosom, but it would be developed. He would put on the air of piety and innocence, but his secret sin would be known. This seems to be the general sense of the verse; and it is not necessary to attempt to show "how" it would be done - whether by lightning from heaven, as Noyes supposes, or whether by some direct manifestation from the skies. Probably the meaning is, that the divine dispensations toward such a man - the overwhelming calamities which he would experience, would show what he was. The word "heaven" is not unfrequently put for God himself. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-23.htm">Daniel 4:23</a>, "the heavens do rule." <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-21.htm">Luke 15:21</a>, "I have sinned against heaven."<p>The earth shall rise up against him - Calamities from the earth. The course of events here. Want of success - sterility of soil - blight and mildew, would rise up against such a man and show what he was.

Heaven and earth conspire together against the sinner.

This is Zophar's reply to the appeal which Job made (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18, 19</a>) to heaven and earth to bear their witness in his favour. Heaven, he says, instead of testifying to his innocence, will one day, when the books are opened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>), "reveal his iniquity;" and earth, instead of echoing his cry, will "rise up" in indignation "against him." He will have none either in heaven or earth to take his part, or give any testimony in his favour. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  Nothing escaped his covetousness,<p>Therefore his prosperity shall not continue.<p>22  In the fulness of his need it shall be strait with him,<p>Every hand of the needy shall come upon him.<p>23  It shall come to pass: in order to fill his belly,<p>He sendeth forth the glow of His anger into him,<p>And He causeth it to rain upon him into his flesh.<p>24  He must flee from an iron weapon,<p>Therefore a brazen bow pierceth him through.<p>25  It teareth, then it cometh forth out of his body,<p>And the steel out of his gall,<p>The terrors of death come upon him.<p>The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-21.htm">Job 20:21</a> are: there was nothing that escaped (&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-19.htm">Job 18:19</a>, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1491;, Arab. s&#780;arada, aufugere) his eating (from &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, not from &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;), i.e., he devoured everything without sparing, even to the last remnant; therefore &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;, his prosperity, his abundant wealth, will not continue or hold out (&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a>, to be solid, powerful, enduring, whence &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, Arab. h&#780;&#305;&#770;lat, h&#803;awl).
