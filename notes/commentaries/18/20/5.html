The triumph of the wicked and the joy of the hypocrite are fleeting. The pleasures and gains of sin bring disease and pain; they end in remorse, anguish, and ruin. Dissembled piety is double iniquity, and the ruin that attends it will be accordingly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That the triumphing - The word "triumphing" here (&#1512;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492;  rena&#770;na&#770;h)," shouting, rejoicing" - such a shouting as people make after a victory, or such as occurred at the close of harvesting. Here it means that the occasion which the wicked had for rejoicing would be brief. It would be but for a moment, and he then would be overwhelmed with calamity or cut off by death.<p>Short - Margin, as in Hebrew "from near." That is, it would be soon over.<p>And the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? - This probably means, as used by Zophar, that the happiness of a hypocrite would be brief - referring to the happiness arising from the possession of health, life, property, friends, reputation. Soon God would take away all these, and leave him to sorrow. This, he said, was the regular course of events as they had been observed from the earliest times. But the "language" conveys most important truths in reference to the spiritual joys of the hypocrite at all times, though it is not certain that Zophar used it in this sense. The truths are these.<p>(1) There is a kind of joy which a hypocrite may have - the counterfeit of that which a true Christian possesses. The word "hypocrite" may be used in a large sense to denote the man who is a professor of religion, but who has none, as well as him who intentionally imposes on others, and who makes pretensions to piety which he knows he has not. Such a man may have joy. He supposes that his sins are forgiven, and that he has a well-founded hope of eternal life. He may have been greatly distressed in view of his sin and danger, and when he supposes that his heart is changed, and that the danger is passed, from the nature of the case he will have a species of enjoyment. A man is confined in a dungeon under sentence of death. A forged instrument of pardon is brought to him. He does not know that it is forged, and supposes the danger is past, and his joy will be as real as though the pardon were genuine. So with the man who "supposes" that his sins are forgiven.<p>(2) The joy of the self-deceiver or the hypocrite will be short. There is no genuine religion to sustain it, and it soon dies away. It may be at first very elevated, just as the joy of the man who supposed that he was pardoned would fill him with exultation. But in the case of the hypocrite it soon dies away. He has no true love to God; he has never been truly reconciled to him; he has no real faith in Christ; he has no sincere love of prayer, of the Bible, or of Christians and soon the temporary excitement dies away, and he lives without comfort or peace. He may be a professor of religion, but with him it is a matter of form, and he has neither love nor zeal in the cause of his professed Master. Motives of pride, or the desire of a reputation for piety, or some other selfish aim may keep him in the church, and he lives to shed blighting on all around him. Or if, under the illusion, he should be enabled to keep up some emotions of happiness in his bosom, they must soon cease, for to the hypocrite death will soon end it all. How much does it become us, therefore, to inquire whether the peace which we seek and which we may possess in religion, is the genuine happiness which results from true reconciliation to God and a well founded hope of salvation. Sad will be the disappointment of him who has cherished a hope of heaven through life, should he at last sink down to hell! Deep the condemnation of him who has professed to be a friend of God, and who has been at heart his bitter foe; who has endeavored to keep up the forms of religion, but who has been a stranger through life to the true peace which religion produces! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the hypocrite&#8212;literally, "the ungodly" (Ps 37:35, 36).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Is short, </span> Heb. is <span class="ital">from near</span>, i.e. from or for a little time; they have not long enjoyed it, and it will shortly vanish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The joy of the hypocrite:</span> this he adds by way of reflection upon Job, who though he did clear himself from gross wickedness, yet might be guilty of deep hyprocrisy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That the triumphing of the wicked is short,.... Their outward prosperity and felicity, of which they make their boast, and in which they glory and triumph for a while; at first Job's friends set out with this notion, that the wicked never flourished and prospered, but it always went ill with them in Providence; but being beat out of that, they own they may be for a small time in flourishing and prosperous circumstances, but it is but for a small time; which may be true in many instances, but it is not invariable and without exception the case: the sense is, it is but a little while that they are in so much mirth and jollity, and triumph over their neighbours, as being in more advantageous circumstances than they; this is said in the original text to be "from near" (h); it is but a little while ago when it began; and; as the Targum paraphrases it, it will be quickly ended: <p>and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment; the word "wicked", in the former clause, may signify the same person here called the "hypocrite"; but inasmuch as that signifies one restless and troublesome, one that is ungodly, and destitute of the fear of God, that has nothing in him but wickedness, who is continually committing it, and is abandoned to it; it might be thought not to apply to the character of Job, whom Zophar had in his view, and therefore this is added as descriptive of him: an hypocrite is one who seems to be that he is not, holy, righteous, good, and godly; who professes to have what he has not, the true grace of God, and pretends to worship God, but does not do it cordially, and from right principles; and who seeks himself in all he does, and not the glory of God: now there may be a joy in such sort of persons; they may hear ministers gladly, as Herod heard John, and receive the word with joy, as the stony ground hearers did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>; they may seem to delight in the ways and ordinances of God, and even have some tastes of the powers of the world to come, and some pleasing thoughts and hopes of heaven and happiness; as well as they triumph in and boast of their profession of religion and performance of duties, and rejoice in their boastings, which is evil; but then this is like the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season, or like the crackling of thorns under a pot, which make a great noise and blaze, but soon over, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>; and so their joy in civil as well as religious, things. It is possible Zophar might be so ill natured as to have reference to Job's triumph of faith, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>; and by this would suggest, that his faith in a living Redeemer, and the joy of it he professed, would be soon over and no more; which shows what spirit he was of. <p>(h) "de propinquo", Pagninus, Montanus, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the triumphing of the wicked is short</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35, 36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17-19</a>, etc.). This is one of the main points of dispute between Job and his opponents. It has been previously maintained by Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-3.htm">Job 5:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21, 29</a>) and by Bildad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11-19</a>), as it is now by Zophar, and may be regarded as the traditional belief of the time, which scarcely any ventured to question. His own observation, however, has convinced Job that the fact is otherwise. He has seen the wicked "live, become old, and remain mighty in power" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>); he has seen them "spend their days in wealth," and die quietly, as "in a moment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a> he seems to argue that this is the general, if not universal, lot of such persons. Later on, however, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-13.htm">Job 27:13-23</a>, he retracts this view, or, at any rate, greatly modifies it, admitting that usually retribution does even in this life overtake the wicked. And this seems to be the general sentiment of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Raro antecedentem scelestum,<br />Deseruit pede poena claudlo."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Horace, 'Od.,' 3:2, ll. 31, 32.</span>) There remains, however, the question whether the triumphing of the wicked can fairly be considered "short," and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. When we consider the lives of Dionysius the elder, Sylla, Marius, Tiberius, Louis XIV., Napoleon, it is difficult to answer this question in the affirmative. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>26  And after my skin, thus torn to pieces,<p>And without my flesh shall I behold Eloah,<p>27  Whom I shall behold for my good,<p>And mine eyes shall see Him and no other - <p>My veins languish in my bosom.<p>28  Ye think: "How shall we persecute him?"<p>Since the root of the matter is found in me - <p>29  Therefore be ye afraid of the sword,<p>For wrath meeteth the transgressions of the sword,<p>That ye may know there is a judgment!<p>If we have correctly understood &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;,Job 19:25, we cannot in this speech find that the hope of a bodily recovery is expressed.

Lit. i. 3, 1787, von Clln, BCr., Knapp, von Hofm., <p>(Note: Von Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, ii. 2, 503) translates: "I know, however, my Redeemer is living, and hereafter He will stand forth which must have been &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; instead of &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;] upon the earth and after my skin, this surrounding (&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;, Chaldaism, instead of &#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; after the form &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;), and from my flesh shall I behold God, whom I shall behold for myself, and my eyes see [Him], and He is not strange.")<p>and others), but hereby the relation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a> becomes a contrast, without there being anything to indicate it. Moreover, this rendering, as &#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; may also be explained, is in itself contrary to the spirit and plan of the book; for the character of Job's present state of mind is, that he looks for certain death, and will hear nothing of the consolation of recovery (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10-16</a>), which sounds to him as mere mockery; that he, however, notwithstanding, does not despair of God, but, by the consciousness of his innocence and the uncharitableness of the friends, is more and more impelled from the God of wrath and caprice to the God of love, his future Redeemer; and that then, when at the end of the course of suffering the actual proof of God's love breaks through the seeming manifestation of wrath, even that which Job had not ventured to hope is realized: a return of temporal prosperity beyond his entreaty and comprehension.<p>On the other hand, the mode of interpretation of the older translators and expositors, who find an expression of the hope of a resurrection at the end of the preceding strophe or the beginning of this, cannot be accepted.
