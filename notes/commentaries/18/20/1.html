He tells him it is in vain to tax their suspicions with unkindness; for it was of public notoriety, agreeable to the universal experience of mankind, ever since the creation, that suffering was the portion of the wicked. He then, under colour of describing the wicked man, and his destiny, charges Job with the most enormous crimes, and marks him out as a person in whom God had given an example of the justice of his providence; and concludes with a plain intimation, that he was thoroughly persuaded that Job was that very wicked man, that oppressor of the poor, which they had from the beginning suspected him to be.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-9 Zophar's discourse is upon the certain misery of the wicked. The triumph of the wicked and the joy of the hypocrite are fleeting. The pleasures and gains of sin bring disease and pain; they end in remorse, anguish, and ruin. Dissembled piety is double iniquity, and the ruin that attends it will be accordingly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be ye afraid of the sword - Of the sword of justice, of the wrath of God. In taking such views, and using such language, you ought to dread the vengeance of God, for he will punish the guilty.<p>For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword - The word "bringeth" is supplied by the translators, and as it seems to me improperly. The idea is, that wrath or anger such as they had manifested, was proper for punishment; that such malice as they had shown was a crime that God would not suffer to escape unpunished. They had, therefore, everything to dread. Literally, it is, "for wrath the iniquities of the sword;" that is, wrath is a crime for the sword.<p>That ye may know that there is a judgment - That there is justice; that God punishes injuries done to the character, and that he will come forth to vindicate his friends. Probably Job anticipated that when God should come forth to vindicate "him," he would inflict exemplary punishment on "them;" and that this would be not only by words, but by some heavy judgment, such as he had himself experienced. The vindication of the just is commonly attended with the punishment of the unjust; the salvation of the friends of God is connected with the destruction of his foes. Job seems to have anticipated this in the case of himself and his friends; it will certainly occur in the great day when the affairs of this world shall be wound up in the decisions of the final judgment.

Notwithstanding the sad distressed condition Job was in, an account of which is given in the preceding chapter, enough to pierce a heart of stone, notwithstanding his earnest request to his friends to have pity on him, and notwithstanding the noble confession of his faith he had made, which showed him to be a good man, and the excellent advice he gave his friends to cease persecuting him, for their own good, as well as for his peace; yet, regardless of these things, Zophar starts up and makes a reply, and attacks him with as much heat and passion, wrath and anger, as ever, harping upon the same string, and still representing Job as a wicked man and an hypocrite; <p>and said, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-29.</span> - Zophar's second speech is even more harsh than his first (ch. 11.). He adds coarseness and rudeness to his former vehement hostility (vers. 7, 15). His whole discourse is a covert denunciation of Job as a wicked man and a hypocrite (vers. 5, 12, 19, 29), deservedly punished by God for a life of crime. He ends by prophesying Job's violent death, the destruction of his house, and the rising up of heaven and earth in witness against him (vers. 24-28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, <span class="cmt_word">Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer</span>.

His natural strength becomes more and more feeble, and his voice weaker and weaker. It is a feeling of sadness that prevails in the preceding description of suffering, and now even stamps the address to the friends with a tone of importunate entreaty which shall, if possible, affect their heart. They are indeed his friends, as the emphatic &#1512;&#1506;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; affirms; impelled towards him by sympathy they are come, and at least stand by him while all other men flee from him. They are therefore to grant him favour (&#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, prop. to incline to) in the place of right; it is enough that the hand of Eloah has touched him (in connection with this, one is reminded that leprosy is called &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;, and is pre-eminently accounted as plaga divina; wherefore the suffering Messiah also bears the significant name &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1491;&#1489;&#1497; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, "the leprous one from the school of Rabbi," in the Talmud, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>), they are not to make the divine decree heavier to him by their uncharitableness. Wherefore do ye persecute me - he asks them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a> - like as God (&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, according to Saad. and Ralbag  equals  &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which would be very tame); by which he means not merely that they add their persecution to God's, but that they take upon themselves God's work, that they usurp to themselves a judicial divine authority, they act towards him as if they were superhuman (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>), and therefore inhumanly, since they, who are but his equals, look down upon him from an assumed and false elevation. The other half of the question: wherefore are ye not full of my flesh (de ma chair, with &#1502;&#1503;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a>), but still continue to devour it? is founded upon a common Semitic figurative expression, with which may be compared our Germ. expression, "to gnaw with the tooth of slander" comp. Engl. "backbiting". In Chaldee, &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1511;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; &#1491;&#1497;, to eat the pieces of (any one), is equivalent to, to slander him; in Syriac, ochelqarsso is the name of Satan, like &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The Arabic here, as almost everywhere in the book of Job, presents a still closer parallel; for Arab. 'kl lh&#803;m signifies to eat any one's flesh, then (different from &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>) equivalent to, to slander, <p>(Note: Vid., Schultens' ad Prov. Meidanii, p. 7 (where "to eat his own flesh," equivalent to "himself," without allowing others to do it, signifies to censure his kinsmen), and comp. the phrase Arab. aclu-l-a&#8219;ra&#770;dhi in the signification arrodere existimationem hominum in Makkari, i. 541, 13.)<p>since an evil report is conceived of as a wild beast, which delights in tearing a neighbour to pieces, as the friends do not refrain from doing, since, from the love of their assumption that his suffering must be the retributive punishment of heinous sins, they lay sins to his charge of which he is not conscious, and which he never committed. Against these uncharitable and groundless accusations he wishes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-23.htm">Job 19:23</a>) that the testimony of his innocence, to which they will not listen, might be recorded in a book for posterity, or because a book may easily perish, graven in a rock (therefore not on leaden plates) with an iron style, and the addition of lead, with which to fill up the engraved letters, and render them still more imperishable. In connection with the remarkable fidelity with which the poet throws himself back into the pre-Israelitish patriarchal time of his hero, it is of no small importance that he ascribes to him an acquaintance not only with monumental writing, but also with book and documentary writing (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-35.htm">Job 31:35</a>).<p>The fut., which also elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-8.htm">Job 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-13.htm">Job 14:13</a>, once the praet., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3</a>, noverim) follows &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, quis dabat  equals  utinam, has Waw consec. here (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a> the praet.); the arrangement of the words is extremely elegant, &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; stands per hyperbaton emphatically prominent. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; and &#1495;&#1511;&#1511; (whence fut.
