Observe man's present place: he is upon earth. He is yet on earth, not in hell. Is there not a time appointed for his abode here? yes, certainly, and the appointment is made by Him who made us and sent us here. During that, man's life is a warfare, and as day-labourers, who have the work of the day to do in its day, and must make up their account at night. Job had as much reason, he thought, to wish for death, as a poor servant that is tired with his work, has to wish for the shadows of the evening, when he shall go to rest. The sleep of the labouring man is sweet; nor can any rich man take so much satisfaction in his wealth, as the hireling in his day's wages. The comparison is plain; hear his complaint: His days were useless, and had long been so; but when we are not able to work for God, if we sit still quietly for him, we shall be accepted. His nights were restless. Whatever is grievous, it is good to see it appointed for us, and as designed for some holy end. When we have comfortable nights, we must see them also appointed to us, and be thankful for them. His body was noisome. See what vile bodies we have. His life was hastening apace. While we are living, every day, like the shuttle, leaves a thread behind: many weave the spider's web, which will fail, ch. 8:14. But if, while we live, we live unto the Lord, in works of faith and labours of love, we shall have the benefit, for every man shall reap as he sowed, and wear as he wove.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My flesh is clothed with worms - Job here undoubtedly refers to his diseased state, and this is one of the passages by which we may learn the nature of his complaint; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>. There is reference here to the worms which are produced in ulcers and in other forms of disease. Michaelis remarks that such effects are produced often in the elephantiasis. Bochart, Hieroz. P. II, Lib. IV. c. xxvi. pp. 619-621, has abundantly proved that such effects occur in disease, and has mentioned several instances where death ensued from this cause; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-23.htm">Acts 12:23</a>. The same thing would often happen - and particularly in hot climates - if it were not for the closest care and attention in keeping running sores as clean as possible.<p>And clods of dust - Accumulated on the ulcers which covered his whole body. This effect would be almost unavoidable. Dr. Good renders this, "worms and the imprisoning dust," and supposes that the image is taken from the grave, and that the idea in the whole passage is that of one who is "dead while he lives;" that is, of one who is undergoing putrefaction before he is buried. But the more common and correct interpretation is that which refers it to the accumulated filth attending a loathsome disease; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>. The word which is used here and rendered clods (&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;  gu&#770;sh) means a lump of earth or dust. Septuagint, &#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  bo&#772;lakas ge&#772;s; Vulgate, sordes pulveris," clods of earth." The whole verse is rendered by the Septuagint," My body swarms with the putrefaction of worms, and I moisten the clods of earth with the ichor (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  icho&#772;ros) of ulcers."<p>My skin is broken -  - &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;  ra&#770;ga&#8219;. This word means, to make afraid, to terrify; and then to shrink together from fear, or to contract. Here it means, according to Gesenius, that "the skin came together and healed, and then broke forth again and ran with pus." Jerome renders it, aruit - dries up. Herder, "my skin becometh closed." Dr. Good, "my skin becometh stiff;" and carries out his idea that the reference here is to the stiffened and rigid appearance of the body after death. Doederlin supposes that it refers to the rough and horrid appearance of the skin in the elephantiasis, when it becomes rigid and frightful by the disease. Jarchi renders it, cutis mea corrugata - my skin is rough, or filled with wrinkles. This seems to me to be the idea, that it was filled with wrinkles and corrugations; that it became stiff, fixed, frightful, and was such as to excite terror in the beholder.<p>And become loathsome - Gesenius, "runs again with pus." The word here used &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;  ma&#770;'as means properly to reject, contemn, despise. A second sense which it has is, to melt, to run like water; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-7.htm">Psalm 58:7</a>, "Let them melt away (&#1497;&#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;  y&#305;&#770;ma&#770;'asu&#770;) as waters." But the usual meaning is to be preferred here. His skin became abhorrent and loathsome in the sight of others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

This is rather poetical than strictly medical. The special characteristic of elephantiasis, from which it derives its name, is that the integument, or outer skin, is "formed into large masses or folds, with a rugose condition of the surface, not unlike the appearance of an elephant's leg" (Quain, vol. 1. p. 431). But the swellings do not contain clods of dust<span class="cmt_word">. My skin is broken, and become loathsome</span>. A common feature in elephantiasis is the development and gradual growth of solid papules or tubercles in the skin. These enlarge as the disease progresses, and after a time soften and break up; an nicer is then formed, and a discharge follows of a virulent and loathsome character. Presently the discharge steps; the ulcer heals; but only to break out again in another place.
