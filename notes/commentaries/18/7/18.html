But in the midst of this discourse, Job seems to have lifted up his thoughts to God with some faith and hope. Observe the concern he is in about his sins. The best men have to complain of sin; and the better they are, the more they will complain of it. God is the Preserver of our lives, and the Saviour of the souls of all that believe; but probably Job meant the Observer of men, whose eyes are upon the ways and hearts of all men. We can hide nothing from Him; let us plead guilty before his throne of grace, that we may not be condemned at his judgment-seat. Job maintained, against his friends, that he was not a hypocrite, not a wicked man, yet he owns to his God, that he had sinned. The best must so acknowledge, before the Lord. He seriously inquires how he might be at peace with God, and earnestly begs forgiveness of his sins. He means more than the removing of his outward trouble, and is earnest for the return of God's favour. Wherever the Lord removes the guilt of sin, he breaks the power of sin. To strengthen his prayer for pardon, Job pleads the prospect he had of dying quickly. If my sins be not pardoned while I live, I am lost and undone for ever. How wretched is sinful man without a knowledge of the Saviour!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And that thou shouldest visit him? - That is, for the purpose of inflicting pain. This language Job intends undoubtedly to be applicable to himself, and he asks with impatience why God should take a pleasure in visiting with suffering each returning day a creature like him?<p>Every morning - Why is there no intermission even for a day? Why does not God allow one morning, or one moment, to pass without inflicting pain on a creature so feeble and so frail?<p>And try him - Or, prove him; to wit, by afflictions.<p>Every moment - Constantly; without intermission. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

Therefore, O Lord, do not thus magnify and visit me with thy mercy, but take away my life. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,.... That is, "daily", continually, as Aben Ezra interprets it; either in a way of love, grace, and mercy; so God has visited men, by raising up and sending his Son to be a Redeemer of them; the Son of God has visited them, as the dayspring from on high, by his incarnation and appearance in this world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a>; and the Lord visits them, by calling them by his grace, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>; by communing and conversing with them in a free and friendly manner; by helping right early, and by renewing his mercies to them every morning, all which is matter of admiration: or else the word may be taken in a different sense, as it sometimes is, either for punishing man for sin, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; or for chastising the Lord's people, which is a visiting them, though in a fatherly way, and in love, and which is often and frequently done, even every morning, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-32.htm">Psalm 89:32</a>; and so the sense agrees with the former, though by some given with this difference thus, "what is man, that thou shouldest magnify him?" or make him great both in things temporal and spiritual, as he had made Job in the time of his prosperity, which he may have respect unto; having been the greatest man in all the east, with respect to both characters, whereby it was plain he had interest in the love and affections of the heart of God; and "yet, notwithstanding, nevertheless, thou visitest him" (t), with afflictions and chastisements continually; which may seem strange, and look like a contradiction, that thou shouldest: <p>and try him every moment? by afflictive providences; in this way the Lord often tries the faith and patience, the fear and love, the hope and humility of his people, and all other graces, whereby they appear and shine the brighter, which was Job's case, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>; and which he doubtless had in view in all he had said, and more particularly expostulates about in the following verses. <p>(t) "et tamen, nihilominus visitas eum", Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. The words of this verse recall <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-5.htm" title="For you have made him a little lower than the angels, and have crowned him with glory and honor.">Psalm 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-3.htm" title="LORD, what is man, that you take knowledge of him! or the son of man, that you make account of him!">Psalm 144:3</a>, the former of which passages at least must have been in the Author’s mind. The admiring gratefulness of the Psalmist that God condescended to visit man and gave him such a place in His estimation is parodied by Job, and the Psalmist’s words are made with bitter irony to express his wonder that God should occupy Himself continually with so slight a thing as man, and make him the object of His unceasing persecution.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that thou shouldset visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</span> Our <span class="accented">whole</span> life is a probation, not merely particular parts of it. God "tries us <span class="accented">every moment</span>" if not with afflictions, then with blessings; if not with pains, then with pleasures. He is with us all the day long, and all our life long, equally in his mercies and in his chastisements. But Job was probably thinking only of the latter. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  Am I a sea or a sea-monster,<p>That thou settest a watch over me?<p>13  For I said, My bed shall comfort me;<p>My couch shall help me to bear my complaint.<p>14  Then thou scaredst me with dreams,<p>And thou didst wake me up in terror from visions,<p>15  So that my soul chose suffocation,<p>Death rather than this skeleton.<p>16  I loathe it, I would not live alway;<p>Let me alone, for my days are breath.<p>Since a watch on the sea can only be designed to effect the necessary precautions at its coming forth from the shores, it is probable that the poet had the Nile in mind when he used &#1497;&#1501;, and consequently the crocodile by &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;. The Nile is also called &#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>, and in Homer &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, Egyptian oham ( equals  &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), and is even now called (at least by the Bedouins) bahhr (Arab. bahr). The illustrations of the book, says von Gerlach correctly, are chiefly Egyptian. On the contrary, Hahn thinks the illustration is unsuitable of the Nile, because it is not watched on account of its danger, but its utility; and Schlottman thinks it even small and contemptible without assigning a reason. The figure is, however, appropriate. As watches are set to keep the Nile in channels as soon as it breaks forth, and as men are set to watch that they may seize the crocodile immediately he moves here or there; so Job says all his movements are checked at the very commencement, and as soon as he desires to be more cheerful he feels the pang of some fresh pain. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-13.htm">Job 7:13</a>, &#1489; after &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; is partitive, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>; Mercier correctly: non nihil querelam meam levabit. If he hopes for such repose, it forthwith comes to nought, since he starts up affrighted from his slumber. Hideous dreams often disturb the sleep of those suffering with elephantiasis, says Avicenna (in Stickel, S. 170). Then he desires death; he wishes that his difficulty of breathing would increase to suffocation, the usual end of elephantiasis. &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1511; is absolute (without being obliged to point it &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1511; with Schlottm.), as e.g., &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1505;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a> (Ewald, 160, c). He prefers death to these his bones, i.e., this miserable skeleton or framework of bone to which he is wasted away. He despises, i.e., his life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-21.htm">Job 9:21</a>. Amid such suffering he would not live for ever. &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, like &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>. </body></html>
