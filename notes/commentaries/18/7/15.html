Dying is done but once, and therefore it had need be well done. An error here is past retrieve. Other clouds arise, but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of men is raised up, but the former generation vanishes away. Glorified saints shall return no more to the cares and sorrows of their houses; nor condemned sinners to the gaieties and pleasures of their houses. It concerns us to secure a better place when we die. From these reasons Job might have drawn a better conclusion than this, I will complain. When we have but a few breaths to draw, we should spend them in the holy, gracious breathings of faith and prayer; not in the noisome, noxious breathings of sin and corruption. We have much reason to pray, that He who keeps Israel, and neither slumbers nor sleeps, may keep us when we slumber and sleep. Job covets to rest in his grave. Doubtless, this was his infirmity; for though a good man would choose death rather than sin, yet he should be content to live as long as God pleases, because life is our opportunity of glorifying him, and preparing for heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So that my soul - So that I; the soul being put for himself.<p>Chooseth strangling - Dr. Good renders it "suffocation," and supposes that Job alludes to the oppression of breathing, produced by what is commonly called the night-mare, and that he means that he would prefer the sense of suffocation excited at such a time to the terrible images before his mind. Herder renders it, death. Jerome, suspendium. The Septuagint, "Thou separatest (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  apallaceis) my life from my spirit, and my bones from death;" but what idea they attached to it, it is impossible now to tell. The Syriac renders it, "Thou choosest my soul from perdition, and my bones from death." The word rendered strangling (&#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1511;  macha&#774;naq) is from &#1495;&#1504;&#1511;  cha&#770;naq, to be narrow, strait, close; and then means to strangle, to throttle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>. Here it means death; and Job designs to say that he would prefer even the most violent kind of death to the life that he was then leading. I see no evidence that the idea suggested by Dr. Good is to be found in the passage.<p>And death rather than my life - Margin, as in Hebrew, bones. There has been great variety in the exposition of this part of the verse. Herder renders it, "death rather than this frail body." Rosenmuller and Noyes, "death rather than my bones;" that is, he preferred death to such an emaciated body as he then had, to the wasted skeleton which was then all that he had left to him. This is probably the true sense. Job was a sufferer in body and in soul. His flesh was wasting away, his body was covered with ulcers, and his mind was harassed with apprehensions. By day he had no peace, and at night he was terrified by alarming visions and spectres; and he preferred death in any form to such a condition. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. Umbreit translates, "So that I could wish to strangle myself&#8212;dead by my own hands." He softens this idea of Job's harboring the thought of suicide, by representing it as entertained only in agonizing dreams, and immediately repudiated with horror in Job 7:16, "Yet that (self-strangling) I loathe." This is forcible and graphic. Perhaps the meaning is simply, "My soul chooses (even) strangling (or any violent death) rather than my life," literally, "my bones" (Ps 35:10); that is, rather than the wasted and diseased skeleton, left to him. In this view, "I loathe it" (Job 7:16) refers to his life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Chooseth; </span> not simply and in itself, but comparatively, rather than such a wretched life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Strangling; </span> the most violent, so it be but a certain and sudden death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Rather than my life, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">than my bones</span>, i.e. than my body, formerly the soul’s dear and desired companion; or than to be in the body, which commonly consists of skin, and flesh, and bones, but in Job was in a manner nothing but a bundle of boiles; for his skin was every where broken, and his flesh was quite consumed, as he oft complains, and his bones also were not free from pain and torment; for as Satan’s commission reached to Job’s <span class="ital">bones</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm" title="But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.">Job 2:5</a></span>, so doubtless his malice and wicked design would engage him to execute it to the utmost. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/job/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So that my soul chooseth strangling,.... Not to strangle himself, as Ahithophel did, or to be strangled by others, this being a kind of death inflicted on capital offenders; but rather, as Mr. Broughton renders it, "to be choked to death" by any distemper and disease, as some are of a suffocating nature, as a catarrh, quinsy, &amp;c. and kill in that way; and indeed death in whatsoever way is the stopping of a man's breath; and it was death that Job chose, let it be in what way it would, whether natural or violent; so weary was he of life through his sore and heavy afflictions: <p>and death rather than my life; or, "than my bones" (i); which are the more solid parts of the body, and the support of it, and are put for the whole and the life thereof; or than these bones of his, which were full of strong pain, and which had nothing but skin upon them, and that was broken and covered with worms, rottenness, and dust; the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "and my bones death"; that is, desired and chose death, being so full of pain, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-10.htm">Psalm 35:10</a>. <p>(i) "prae ossibus meis", Montanus, Tigurine version, Bolducius, Cocceius, Schmidt, Schultens; so Mercerus, Piscator, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So that my soul <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> chooseth strangling, <i>and</i> death rather than my life.</span><p>(k) He speaks as one overcome with sorrow, and not of judgment, or of the examination of his faith.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>.

Here we first meet with the name of the lower world; and in the book of Job we learn the ancient Israelitish conception of it more exactly than anywhere else. We have here only to do with the name in connection with the grammatical exposition. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; (usually gen. fem.) is now almost universally derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500;, to be hollow, to be deepened; and aptly so, for they imagined the Sheo&#770;l as under ground, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-33.htm">Numbers 16:33</a> alone shows, on which account even here, as from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a> onwards, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; is everywhere used. It is, however, open to question whether this derivation is correct: at least passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>., show that in the later usage of the language, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, to demand, was thought of in connection with it; derived from which Sheo&#770;l signifies (1) the appointed inevitable and inexorable demanding of everything earthly (an infinitive noun like &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;); (2) conceived of as space, the place of shadowy duration whither everything on earth is demanded; (3) conceived of according to its nature, the divinely appointed fury which gathers in and engulfs everything on the earth. Job knows nothing of a demanding back, a redemption from Sheo&#770;l. </body></html>
