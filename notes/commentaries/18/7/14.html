Dying is done but once, and therefore it had need be well done. An error here is past retrieve. Other clouds arise, but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of men is raised up, but the former generation vanishes away. Glorified saints shall return no more to the cares and sorrows of their houses; nor condemned sinners to the gaieties and pleasures of their houses. It concerns us to secure a better place when we die. From these reasons Job might have drawn a better conclusion than this, I will complain. When we have but a few breaths to draw, we should spend them in the holy, gracious breathings of faith and prayer; not in the noisome, noxious breathings of sin and corruption. We have much reason to pray, that He who keeps Israel, and neither slumbers nor sleeps, may keep us when we slumber and sleep. Job covets to rest in his grave. Doubtless, this was his infirmity; for though a good man would choose death rather than sin, yet he should be content to live as long as God pleases, because life is our opportunity of glorifying him, and preparing for heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then thou scarest me - This is an address to God. He regarded him as the source of his sorrows, and he expresses his sense of this in language indeed very beautiful, but far from reverence.<p>With dreams - see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-4.htm">Job 7:4</a>. A similar expression occurs in Ovid:<p>Ut puto, cam requies medicinaque publica curae,<p>Somnus adest, soliris nox venit orba malis,<p>Somnia me terrent. veros imitantia casus,<p>Et vigilant sensus in mea damna mei.<p>Do Ponto, Lib. i.

This refers to the visions of the fancy, or to frightful appearances in the night. The belief of such night-visions was common in the early ages, and Job regarded them as under the direction of God, and as being designed to alarm him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Not with dreams and visions being told him, as were by Eliphaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>; but with dreams he himself dreamed; and which might arise from the force of his distemper, and the pain of his body, whereby his sleep was broken, his imagination disturbed, and his fancy roving, which led him to objects as seemed to him very terrible and dreadful; or from a melancholy disposition his afflictions had brought upon him; and hence in his dreams he had dismal apprehensions of things very distressing and terrifying; or from Satan, in whose hands he was, and who was permitted to distress and disturb him at such seasons; all which he ascribes to God, because he suffered it so to be: and now these dreams not only hindered sound sleep, and getting that ease and refreshment he hoped for from thence, but even they were frightful and scaring to him, so that instead of being the better for his bed and his couch, he was the worse; these dreams added to his afflictions, and in them he suffered much, as Pilate's wife is said to do, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19</a>, <p>and terrifiest me through visions; spectres, apparitions, and such like things, being presented to his fancy, while sleeping and dreaming, which filled him with terror, and sorely distressed him, so that he could receive no benefit hereby, but rather was more fatigued and weakened. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then thou scarest me <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</span><p>(i) So that I can have no rest, night or day.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Remember that my life is a breath,<p>That my eye will never again look on prosperity.<p>  8  The eye that looketh upon me seeth me no more;<p>Thine eyes look for me, - I am no more!<p>  9  The clouds are vanished and passed away,<p>So he that goeth down to Shel cometh not up.<p>10  He returneth no more to his house,<p>And his place knoweth him no more.<p>11  Therefore I will not curb my mouth;<p>I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;<p>I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<p>We see good, i.e., prosperity and joy, only in the present life.

No eye (&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; femin.) which now sees me (prop. eye of my seer, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-7.htm">Job 20:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>, for &#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>, or &#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-10.htm">Isaiah 47:10</a>; according to another reading, &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;: no eye of seeing, i.e., no eye with the power of seeing, from &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, vision) sees me again, even if thy eyes should be directed towards me to help me; my life is gone, so that I can no more be the subject of help. For from Shel there is no return, no resurrection (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-16.htm">Psalm 103:16</a> for the expression); therefore will I at least give free course to my thoughts and feelings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-4.htm">Psalm 77:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-15.htm">Isaiah 38:15</a>, for the expression). The &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>, is the so-called &#1490;&#1501; talionis; the parallels cited by Michalis are to the point, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-43.htm">Ezekiel 16:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-9.htm">Malachi 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>. Here we first meet with the name of the lower world; and in the book of Job we learn the ancient Israelitish conception of it more exactly than anywhere else. We have here only to do with the name in connection with the grammatical exposition. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; (usually gen. fem.) is now almost universally derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500;, to be hollow, to be deepened; and aptly so, for they imagined the Sheo&#770;l as under ground, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-33.htm">Numbers 16:33</a> alone shows, on which account even here, as from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a> onwards, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; is everywhere used. It is, however, open to question whether this derivation is correct: at least passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>., show that in the later usage of the language, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, to demand, was thought of in connection with it; derived from which Sheo&#770;l signifies (1) the appointed inevitable and inexorable demanding of everything earthly (an infinitive noun like &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;); (2) conceived of as space, the place of shadowy duration whither everything on earth is demanded; (3) conceived of according to its nature, the divinely appointed fury which gathers in and engulfs everything on the earth. Job knows nothing of a demanding back, a redemption from Sheo&#770;l. </body></html>
