But in the midst of this discourse, Job seems to have lifted up his thoughts to God with some faith and hope. Observe the concern he is in about his sins. The best men have to complain of sin; and the better they are, the more they will complain of it. God is the Preserver of our lives, and the Saviour of the souls of all that believe; but probably Job meant the Observer of men, whose eyes are upon the ways and hearts of all men. We can hide nothing from Him; let us plead guilty before his throne of grace, that we may not be condemned at his judgment-seat. Job maintained, against his friends, that he was not a hypocrite, not a wicked man, yet he owns to his God, that he had sinned. The best must so acknowledge, before the Lord. He seriously inquires how he might be at peace with God, and earnestly begs forgiveness of his sins. He means more than the removing of his outward trouble, and is earnest for the return of God's favour. Wherever the Lord removes the guilt of sin, he breaks the power of sin. To strengthen his prayer for pardon, Job pleads the prospect he had of dying quickly. If my sins be not pardoned while I live, I am lost and undone for ever. How wretched is sinful man without a knowledge of the Saviour!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? - That thou shouldst make him great, or that thou shouldst regard him as of so great importance as to fix thine eye attentively upon him. The idea here is, that it was unworthy the character of so great a being as God to bestow so much time and attention on a creature so insignificant as man; and especially that man could not be of so much importance that it was necessary for God to watch all his defects with vigilance, and take special pains to mark and punish all his offences. This question might be asked in another sense, and with another view. Man is so insignificant compared with God, that it may be asked why he should so carefully provide for his needs? Why make so ample provision for his welfare? Why institute measures so amazing and so wonderful for his recovery from sin? The answers to all these questions must be substantially the same.<p>(1) It is a part of the great plan of a condescending God. No insect is so small as to be beneath his notice. On the humblest and feeblest animalcula a care is bestowed in its formation and support as if God had nothing else to regard or provide for.<p>(2) Man is of importance. He has an immortal soul, and the salvation of that soul is worth all which it costs, even when it costs the blood of the Son of God.<p>(3) A creature who sins, always makes himself of importance. The murderer has an importance in the view of the community which he never had before. All good citizens become interested to arrest and punish him. There is no more certain way for a man to give consequence to himself, than to violate the laws, and to subject himself to punishment. An offending member of a family has an importance which he had not before, and all eyes are turned to him with deep interest. So it is with man - a part of the great family of God.<p>(4) A sufferer is a being of importance, and man as a sufferer is worthy of the notice of God. However feeble may be the powers of anyone, or humble his rank, yet if he suffers, and especially if he is likely to suffer forever, he becomes at once an object of the highest importance: Such is man; a sufferer here, and liable to eternal pain hereafter; and hence, the God of mercy has interposed to visit him, and to devise a way to rescue him from his sorrows, and from eternal death. The Syriac renders this, "What is man, that thou shouldst destroy him?" - but the Hebrew means. "to magnify him, to make him great or of importance."<p>That thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? - Not with affection, but to punish him - for so the expression in this connection evidently means. The phrase itself might mean, "Why shouldst thou love him?" - implying that there was nothing in a creature so insignificant that could render him a proper object of the divine regard. But as used here by Job it means, "Why dost thou fix thy attention upon him so closely - marking the slightest offence, and seeming to take a special pleasure in inflicting pain and torture?" The Psalmist makes use of almost the same language, and not improbably copied it from this, though he employs it in a somewhat different sense. As used by him, it means that it was wonderful that the God who made the heavens should condescend to notice a creature so insignificant as man.<p>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers;<p>The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;<p>What is man, that thou art mindful of him?<p>And the son of man, that thou visitest him:<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. (Ps 8:4; 144:3). Job means, "What is man that thou shouldst make him [of so much importance], and that thou shouldst expend such attention [or, heart-thought] upon him" as to make him the subject of so severe trials? Job ought rather to have reasoned from God's condescending so far to notice man as to try him, that there must be a wise and loving purpose in trial. David uses the same words, in their right application, to express wonder that God should do so much as He does for insignificant man. Christians who know God manifest in the man Christ Jesus may use them still more.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What is there in that poor, mean, contemptible creature called man, <span class="ital">miserable man</span>, as this word signifies, which can induce or incline thee to take any notice of him, to show him such respect, or to make such account of him? Man is not worthy of thy favour, and he is below thy anger. It is too great a condescension to thee, and too great an honour for man, that thou wilt contend with him, and draw forth all thy forces against him, as if he were a fit match for thee; whereas men use to neglect and slight mean adversaries, and will not do them the honour to fight with them. Compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm" title="After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.">1 Samuel 24:14</a></span>.

Man in his best estate, in his original state, was but of the earth, earthly; a mutable creature, and altogether vanity; so that it was wonderful God should magnify him as be did, raise him to such honour and dignity, as to set him over all the works of his hands, and bestow peculiar marks of his favour upon him in Eden's garden; but man in his low and fallen estate, being, as the word here used is generally observed to signify, a frail, feeble, weak, and mortal creature; yea, a sinful one; it is much more marvellous that God should magnify him, or make him great, that is, any of the human race, as he has some, so as "to set his heart upon them", as Jarchi connects this with the following clause; to think of them and provide for them in his purposes and decrees, in his council and covenant, to choose any of them to grace here, and glory hereafter: he has magnified them, by espousing them to his Son, whereby they share with him in his glory, and in all the blessings of his goodness; through the incarnation of Christ, by means of which the human nature is greatly advanced and honoured; and by their redemption through Christ, whereby they are raised to an higher dignity, and restored to a greater estate than they lost by the fall; by clothing them with the rich robe of Christ's righteousness, comparable to the gold of Ophir, and raiment of needlework; and by adorning them with the graces of the blessed Spirit; and, in a word, by taking them into his family, making them his children and his heirs, rich in grace, and heirs of the kingdom of heaven, and kings and priests unto him; taking them as beggars from the dunghill, to sit among princes, and to inherit the throne of glory. The words may be understood in a different sense, and more agreeably to the context, and to the scope of Job's discourse, as they are by some (o), of God's magnifying men by afflicting them; according to which, man is represented as a poor, weak, strengthless creature, a worm and clod of the earth; and the Lord as the mighty God, as of great and infinite power and strength, between whom there is no manner of proportion; God is not a man, that they should come together, or as if on equal foot; nor man a match for God; to wrestle with principalities and powers, which are not flesh and blood, is too much for men of themselves, and how much less able are they to contend with God? Now Job by this suggests, that his thought and sentiment of the matter was, and in which he has a particular view to himself, and his own case; that as on the one hand it was a demeaning the might and majesty of God, by making himself a combatant with man; so on the other hand it was doing man too much honour, as if he was one of more importance and consequence, and more mighty and powerful than he is; whereas he is unworthy of the divine notice in any respect, either to bestow his favours, or lay his afflicting hand upon him; compare with this <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a>. Hence a late learned writer (p), agreeably to the use of the word in the Arabic language, renders it, "what is mortal man, that thou shouldest wrestle with him?" strive and contend with him as if he was thy match, when thou couldest at one blow, and even at a touch, dispatch him at once? <p>and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? have an affection for him, love him, delight in him, highly value and esteem him; it is wonderful that God should have such a regard to any of the sons of men; and yet it is certain that he has, as appears by the good things he has provided and laid up for them in covenant, by sending his Son to die for them, by calling and quickening them by his Spirit and grace, and drawing them with loving kindness to himself; by taking continual care of them, and keeping them as the apple of his eye: though these words may be interpreted agreeably to the other sense, "that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?" or towards him, to afflict him and chastise him with afflictions, so Bar Tzemach; or to stir up himself against him, as Sephorno: and the above late learned writer chooses to render them, "that thou shouldest set thine heart against him?" (q) and so the Hebrew (r) particle is used in many other places; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>; compare with this <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>, where R. Simeon Bar Tzemach (s) thinks Elihu has respect to this passage of Job, and reproves him for it. <p>(o) So Simeon Bar Tzemach, Sephorno, Mercerus, Diodati, Schultens. (p) Schultens.

Second, Job asks, If man be not too mean a thing for God thus to busy Himself with and persecute? cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-3.htm" title="And does you open your eyes on such an one, and bring me into judgment with you?">Job 14:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">set thine heart</span>] that is, thy <span class="ital">mind</span>; as <span class="ital">magnify</span> means, to think great, to consider of importance.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him?</span> or, <span class="accented">make so much of</span> him - regard him as of such great importance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>). It seems, at first sight, an exalted idea of God to regard him as too lofty, too great, to be really concerned about so mean a creature, so poor a being, as man. Hence, among the Greeks, the Epicureans maintained that God paid no attention at all to this world, or to anything that happened in it, but dwelt secure and tranquil in the empyrean, with nothing to disturb, displease, or vex him. And the holy men of old sometimes fell into this same phase of thought, and expressed surprise and wonder that God, who dwelt on high, should "humble himself to consider the things in heaven and earth." "Lord," says David, or whoever was the author of the hundred and forty-fourth psalm, "what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? Man k like to vanity; his days are as a shadow that passeth away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3, 4</a>). But all, except Epicureans, agree that God does,  in fact, so concern himself, and a little reflection is enough to show us that the opposite view, instead of exalting, really degrades God. To bring conscious, sentient beings into the world - beings capable of the intensest happiness or misery, and then to leave them wholly to themselves, to have no further care or thought of them, would be the part, not of a grand, glorious, and adorable Being, but of one destitute of any claim to our admiration. <span class="cmt_word">And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</span> This strong expression is not used of God elsewhere. But it well expresses the <span class="accented">extreme</span> tenderness and consideration that God has for man, and the deep love from which that tenderness and consideration spring. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/job/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Remember that my life is a breath,<p>That my eye will never again look on prosperity.<p>  8  The eye that looketh upon me seeth me no more;<p>Thine eyes look for me, - I am no more!<p>  9  The clouds are vanished and passed away,<p>So he that goeth down to Shel cometh not up.<p>10  He returneth no more to his house,<p>And his place knoweth him no more.<p>11  Therefore I will not curb my mouth;<p>I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;<p>I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<p>We see good, i.e., prosperity and joy, only in the present life.

Here we first meet with the name of the lower world; and in the book of Job we learn the ancient Israelitish conception of it more exactly than anywhere else. We have here only to do with the name in connection with the grammatical exposition. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; (usually gen. fem.) is now almost universally derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500;, to be hollow, to be deepened; and aptly so, for they imagined the Sheo&#770;l as under ground, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-33.htm">Numbers 16:33</a> alone shows, on which account even here, as from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a> onwards, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; is everywhere used. It is, however, open to question whether this derivation is correct: at least passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>., show that in the later usage of the language, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, to demand, was thought of in connection with it; derived from which Sheo&#770;l signifies (1) the appointed inevitable and inexorable demanding of everything earthly (an infinitive noun like &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;); (2) conceived of as space, the place of shadowy duration whither everything on earth is demanded; (3) conceived of according to its nature, the divinely appointed fury which gathers in and engulfs everything on the earth. Job knows nothing of a demanding back, a redemption from Sheo&#770;l. </body></html>
