He represents to Job some truths he had too much overlooked. Man's righteousness and holiness, at the best, are nothing in comparison with God's, Ps 89:6. As God is so great and glorious, how can man, who is guilty and impure, appear before him? We need to be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, and to be bathed again and again in the blood of Christ, that Fountain opened, Zec 13:1. We should be humbled as mean, guilty, polluted creatures, and renounce self-dependence. But our vileness will commend Christ's condescension and love; the riches of his mercy and the power of his grace will be magnified to all eternity by every sinner he redeems.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is there any number of his armies? - The armies of heaven; or the hosts of angelic beings, which are often represented as arranged or marshalled into armies; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>. The word which is used here is not the common one which is rendered "hosts," (&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;  tsa&#770;ba&#770;'), but is &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  gedu&#770;d which means properly a troop, band, or army. It may here mean either the constellations often represented as the army which God marshals and commands, or it may mean the angels.<p>And upon whom doth not his light arise? - This is designed evidently to show the majesty and glory of God. It refers probably to the light of the sun, as the light which he creates and commands. The idea is, that it pervades all things; that, as controlled by him, it penetrates all places, and flows over all worlds. The image is a striking and sublime one, and nothing is better fitted to show the majesty and glory of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. armies&#8212;angels and stars (Isa 40:26; Jer 33:22; Ge 15:5; "countless," Da 7:10).<p>his light&#8212;(Jas 1:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/job/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of his armies; </span> of the angels, and stars, and other creatures, all which are his hosts, wholly submitting themselves to his will, to be and do what God would have them; and therefore how insolent and unreasonable a thing is it for thee to quarrel with him!

His armies in heaven, the heavenly host of angels, which are innumerable; there are more than twelve legions of them, thousand and ten thousand times ten thousand, employed in a military way, for the safety and preservation of the saints; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-1.htm">Genesis 32:1</a>; and the sun, moon, and stars, often called the host of heaven, the latter of which cannot be numbered, and which fought in their courses against Sisera, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-20.htm">Judges 5:20</a>; and his armies on earth, all the inhabitants of it; yea, every creature, even the smallest insect in it, which are without number: thus, frogs, lice, flies, and locusts, were the armies of God, with which he fought against Pharaoh and the Egyptians, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>; <p>and upon whom doth not his light arise? either natural light, that grand luminary the sun, which rises on all, the evil and the good, nor is anything hid from the light and heat of it; or moral light, the light of nature, with which everyone that comes into the world is enlightened by him; or the light of providential goodness, which is unto all, and over all his creatures; the whole earth is full of it, and all the inhabitants have a share in it; nor is anything hid from his all piercing, all penetrating, all seeing eye, who is light itself, and dwells in light inaccessible, and from which light nothing can be hid. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/job/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Is there any number of his armies? <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> and upon whom doth not his light arise?</span><p>(b) Who can hide him from his presence?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">his armies</span>] The words still amplify the idea of the “dominion” and omnipotence of God. The armies that obey Him are innumerable. The reference is probably to the phenomena of the heavens by night; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a>, “He bringeth out their host by number, he calleth them all by their names; by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power, not one faileth.” There was a tendency in Oriental thought to identify the angels with the stars, or at least to regard the stars as animated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his light arise</span>] The reference is probably to the heavens or world by day; and the words express the pervading universality of God’s influence and rule. The sun as a body is not directly alluded to, for the word “arise” is not that which ordinarily expresses rising or coming above the horizon; the meaning is rather “on whom doth not his light shine?” By “his light” is not meant the nature of God as essential light; the meaning rather is that by His light which He sends forth God reaches all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-6.htm" title="His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit to the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.">Psalm 19:6</a>) and brings all under His sway, though there may be in “<span class="ital">his</span> light” a reference to the light of day as symbolizing what He is. It is out of the question to limit the words “upon whom” to the “armies” of the first clause, making the query of Bildad to mean, Which of the bright heavenly hosts does not His light outshine? or, Which of them does not shine with a light which falls on it from Him and reflect not its own but His light? The reference in the words “on whom” is not limited to the heavenly host, but is universal.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is there any number of his armies?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>, "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, "Thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;" see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-16.htm">Revelation 9:16</a>).

God is the subject. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, to extend in length, used elsewhere of love, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-11.htm">Psalm 36:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-12.htm">Psalm 109:12</a>, and anger, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/85-6.htm">Psalm 85:6</a>, is here transferred to persons: to prolong, preserve long in life. &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are the strong, who bid defiance not only to every danger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>), but also to all divine influences and noble impulses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-12.htm">Isaiah 46:12</a>). These, whose trust in their own strength God might smite down by His almighty power, He preserves alive even in critical positions by that very power: he (the &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;) stands up (again), whilst he does not trust to life, i.e., whilst he believes that he must succumb to death (&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, comp.

He (God) grants him &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;, in security, viz., to live, or even directly: a secure peaceful existence, since &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; is virtually an object, and the &#1500; is that of condition (comp. &#1500;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>). Thus Hahn, who, however, here is only to be followed in this one particular, takes it correctly: and that he can support himself, which would only be possible if an inf. with &#1500; had preceded. Therefore: and he is supported or he can support himself, i.e., be comforted, though this absolute use of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; cannot be supported; in this instance we miss &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;, or some such expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-15.htm">Job 8:15</a>). God sustains him and raises him up again: His eyes (&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) are (rest) on the ways of these men, they stand as it were beneath His special protection, or, as it is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a> : He causes light to shine from above upon the doings of the wicked. "They are risen up, and are conscious of the height (of prosperity) - a little while, and they are no more." Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a> is to be explained. The accentuation &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; with Mahpach, &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; with Asla legarmeh (according to which it would have to be translated: they stand on high a short time), is erroneous. The verb &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; signifies not merely to be high, but also to rise up, raise one's self, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a>, and to show one's self exalted, here extulerunt se in altum or exaltati sunt; according to the form of writing &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is treated as an Ayin Waw verb med. O, and the Dagesh is a so-called Dag. affecuosum (Olsh. 83, b), while &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (like &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-23.htm">Genesis 49:23</a>) appears to assume the form of a double Ayin verb med.

There is no reference in the phrase to the componere artus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>; it is rather the figure of housing (gathering into the barn) that underlies it; the word, however, only implies seizing and drawing in. Thus the figure which follows is also naturally (comp. &#1511;&#1502;&#1509;, Arab. qabd&#803;at, manipulus) connected with what precedes, and, like the head of an ear of corn, i.e., the corn-bearing head of the wheat-stalk, they are cut off (by which one must bear in mind that the ears are reaped higher up than with us, and the standing stalk is usually burnt to make dressing for the field; vid., Ges. Thes. s.v. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;).<p>(Note: Another figure is also presented here. It is a common thing for the Arabs (Beduins) in harvest-time to come down upon the fields of standing corn - especially barley, because during summer and autumn this grain is indispensable to them as food for their horses - of a district, chiefly at night, and not unfrequently hundreds of camels are laden at one time. As they have no sickles, they cut off the upper part of the stalk with the &#8219;aqfe (a knife very similar to the Roman sica) and with sabres, whence this theft is called qard &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, sabring off; and that which is cut off, as well as the uneven stubble that is left standing, is called qarid. - Wetzst.)).<p>On &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (fut.

But Job does not answer like by like. Even in this speech in opposition to the friends, he maintains the passionless repose which has once been gained. Although the misjudgment of his character has attained its height in the speech of Eliphaz, his answer does not contain a single bitter personal word. In general, he does not address them, not as though he did not wish to show respect to them, but because he has nothing to say concerning their unjust and wrong conduct that he would not already have said, and because he has lost all hope of his reproof taking effect, all hope of sympathy with his entreaty that they would spare him, all hope of understanding and information on their part.<p>continued...</body></html>
