By his naming the moon, and thence proceeding to the stars, he shows that he includes the sun also, and all other creatures, and signifies that the brightest and most glorious objects in nature shine not when compared with God’s ineffable and essential brightness. Indeed, the highest order of beings make but small advances to the essential perfection which is in him; so that, when a comparison is made, their highest purity will be little less than impurity, when brought before the standard of divine perfection.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-6 Bildad shows that man cannot be justified before God. - Bildad drops the question concerning the prosperity of wicked men; but shows the infinite distance there is between God and man. He represents to Job some truths he had too much overlooked. Man's righteousness and holiness, at the best, are nothing in comparison with God's, Ps 89:6. As God is so great and glorious, how can man, who is guilty and impure, appear before him? We need to be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, and to be bathed again and again in the blood of Christ, that Fountain opened, Zec 13:1. We should be humbled as mean, guilty, polluted creatures, and renounce self-dependence. But our vileness will commend Christ's condescension and love; the riches of his mercy and the power of his grace will be magnified to all eternity by every sinner he redeems.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not - Or, behold even the moon shineth not. That is, in comparison with God it is dark and obscure. The idea is, that the most beautiful and glorious objects become dim and fade away when compared with him. So Jerome renders it, Ecce luna etiam non splendet. The word here rendered "shineth" (&#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;  ya'a&#770;hal&#305;&#770;yl) frequently means to pitch or remove a tent, and is a form of the word &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;  'o&#770;hel uniformly rendered tent or tabernacle. Some have supposed that the meaning here is, that even the moon and the stars of heaven - the bright canopy above - were not fit to furnish a tent or dwelling for God. But the parallelism seems to demand the usual interpretation, as meaning that the moon and stars faded away before God. The word &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;  'o&#770;hel derives this meaning, according to Gesenius, from its relation to the word &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;  ha&#770;lal, to be clear or brilliant, from the mutual relation of the &#1508;&#1488; and &#1506;&#1506; verbs. The Arabic has the same meaning.<p>Yea, the stars are not pure in his sight - That is, they are not bright in comparison with him. The design is to show the glory of the Most High and that nothing could be compared with him; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

If all things that are glorious and illustrious in the lower world, and which are between that and the region of the moon, are beheld; or all from the seat of the Divine Majesty, down to that glorious luminary, are viewed, they lose all their lustre and brightness, when compared with the Divine Being; <p>and it, even that itself <p>shineth not; it is darkened, confounded, and ashamed; it hides its beautiful face, and draws in its borrowed and useful light, at the approach of him, who is light itself, and in whom is no darkness at all: or it tabernacles not (n); has no tabernacle to abide in, as is said of the sun, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a>; or does not expand and spread its light, as a tent (o) or tabernacle is spread; it does not diffuse, but contracts it. No mention is made of the sun, not because that shines in its own light, which the moon does not; but perhaps because the controversy between Job and his friends was held in the night, when the moon and the stars were only seen, and therefore only mentioned; otherwise, what is here observed equally holds good of the sun as of the moon; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <p>yea, the stars are not pure in his sight; as there are spots in the sun and in the moon, seen by the eye of man, aided and assisted, so such may be seen by God in the stars also, and in these, both in a natural and in a mystical sense; as by them may be meant the angels of heaven, even those are not pure in the sight of God, and in comparison of him, the most perfectly pure and holy Being; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>. <p>(n)  "et non ponet tabernaculum", Montanus, Bolducius; so Schmidt, Schultens.

Therefore: and he is supported or he can support himself, i.e., be comforted, though this absolute use of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; cannot be supported; in this instance we miss &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;, or some such expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-15.htm">Job 8:15</a>).

"They are risen up, and are conscious of the height (of prosperity) - a little while, and they are no more." Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a> is to be explained.

There is no reference in the phrase to the componere artus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>; it is rather the figure of housing (gathering into the barn) that underlies it; the word, however, only implies seizing and drawing in. Thus the figure which follows is also naturally (comp. &#1511;&#1502;&#1509;, Arab. qabd&#803;at, manipulus) connected with what precedes, and, like the head of an ear of corn, i.e., the corn-bearing head of the wheat-stalk, they are cut off (by which one must bear in mind that the ears are reaped higher up than with us, and the standing stalk is usually burnt to make dressing for the field; vid., Ges. Thes. s.v. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;).<p>(Note: Another figure is also presented here. It is a common thing for the Arabs (Beduins) in harvest-time to come down upon the fields of standing corn - especially barley, because during summer and autumn this grain is indispensable to them as food for their horses - of a district, chiefly at night, and not unfrequently hundreds of camels are laden at one time. As they have no sickles, they cut off the upper part of the stalk with the &#8219;aqfe (a knife very similar to the Roman sica) and with sabres, whence this theft is called qard &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, sabring off; and that which is cut off, as well as the uneven stubble that is left standing, is called qarid. - Wetzst.)).<p>On &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (fut.

'l-&#8219;adam) my assertion?<p>The bold accusations in the speech of Eliphaz, in which the uncharitableness of the friends attains its height, must penetrate most deeply into Job's spirit. But Job does not answer like by like. Even in this speech in opposition to the friends, he maintains the passionless repose which has once been gained. Although the misjudgment of his character has attained its height in the speech of Eliphaz, his answer does not contain a single bitter personal word. In general, he does not address them, not as though he did not wish to show respect to them, but because he has nothing to say concerning their unjust and wrong conduct that he would not already have said, and because he has lost all hope of his reproof taking effect, all hope of sympathy with his entreaty that they would spare him, all hope of understanding and information on their part.<p>continued...</body></html>
