He represents to Job some truths he had too much overlooked. Man's righteousness and holiness, at the best, are nothing in comparison with God's, Ps 89:6. As God is so great and glorious, how can man, who is guilty and impure, appear before him? We need to be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, and to be bathed again and again in the blood of Christ, that Fountain opened, Zec 13:1. We should be humbled as mean, guilty, polluted creatures, and renounce self-dependence. But our vileness will commend Christ's condescension and love; the riches of his mercy and the power of his grace will be magnified to all eternity by every sinner he redeems.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/job/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How then can man be justified with God? - see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17-18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15-16</a>. Instead of meeting the facts to which Job had appealed, all that Bildad could now do was to repeat what had been said before. It shows that he felt himself unable to dispose of the argument, and yet that he was not willing to confess that he was vanquished.<p>Or how can he be clean? - This sentiment had been expressed by Job himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>. Perhaps Bildad meant now to adopt it as undoubted truth, and to throw it back upon Job as worthy of his special attention. It has no bearing on the arguments which Job had advanced, and is utterly irrelevant except as Bildad supposed that the course of argument maintained by Job implied that he supposed himself to be pure. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/job/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

These, whose trust in their own strength God might smite down by His almighty power, He preserves alive even in critical positions by that very power: he (the &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;) stands up (again), whilst he does not trust to life, i.e., whilst he believes that he must succumb to death (&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, comp.

He (God) grants him &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;, in security, viz., to live, or even directly: a secure peaceful existence, since &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; is virtually an object, and the &#1500; is that of condition (comp. &#1500;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>). Thus Hahn, who, however, here is only to be followed in this one particular, takes it correctly: and that he can support himself, which would only be possible if an inf. with &#1500; had preceded. Therefore: and he is supported or he can support himself, i.e., be comforted, though this absolute use of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; cannot be supported; in this instance we miss &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;, or some such expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-15.htm">Job 8:15</a>).

"They are risen up, and are conscious of the height (of prosperity) - a little while, and they are no more." Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a> is to be explained. The accentuation &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; with Mahpach, &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; with Asla legarmeh (according to which it would have to be translated: they stand on high a short time), is erroneous. The verb &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; signifies not merely to be high, but also to rise up, raise one's self, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a>, and to show one's self exalted, here extulerunt se in altum or exaltati sunt; according to the form of writing &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is treated as an Ayin Waw verb med. O, and the Dagesh is a so-called Dag. affecuosum (Olsh. 83, b), while &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (like &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-23.htm">Genesis 49:23</a>) appears to assume the form of a double Ayin verb med. O, consequently &#1512;&#1502;&#1501; (Ges. 67, rem. 1).<p>&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, followed by Waw of the conclusion, forms a clause of itself, as more frequently &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; &#1493; (yet a little while, then ... ), as, e.g., in an exactly similar connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>; here, however, not expressive of the sudden judgment of the ungodly, but of their easy death without a struggle (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;): a little, then he is not (again a transition from the plur. to the distributive or individualizing sing.).

Arab. mkk, to cause to vanish, to annul. &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (for which it is unnecessary with Olsh. to read &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-5.htm">Ezekiel 29:5</a>) signifies, according to the primary signification of &#1511;&#1508;&#1509;, comprehendere, constringere, contrahere (cogn. &#1511;&#1489;&#1509;, &#1511;&#1502;&#1509;, &#1511;&#1502;&#1496;, comp. supra, p. 481): they are hurried together, or snatched off, i.e., deprived of life, like the Arabic qbd&#803;h alla&#770;h (&#1511;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;) and passive qubid&#803;a, equivalent to, he has died. There is no reference in the phrase to the componere artus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>; it is rather the figure of housing (gathering into the barn) that underlies it; the word, however, only implies seizing and drawing in. Thus the figure which follows is also naturally (comp. &#1511;&#1502;&#1509;, Arab. qabd&#803;at, manipulus) connected with what precedes, and, like the head of an ear of corn, i.e., the corn-bearing head of the wheat-stalk, they are cut off (by which one must bear in mind that the ears are reaped higher up than with us, and the standing stalk is usually burnt to make dressing for the field; vid., Ges. Thes. s.v. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;).<p>(Note: Another figure is also presented here. It is a common thing for the Arabs (Beduins) in harvest-time to come down upon the fields of standing corn - especially barley, because during summer and autumn this grain is indispensable to them as food for their horses - of a district, chiefly at night, and not unfrequently hundreds of camels are laden at one time. As they have no sickles, they cut off the upper part of the stalk with the &#8219;aqfe (a knife very similar to the Roman sica) and with sabres, whence this theft is called qard &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, sabring off; and that which is cut off, as well as the uneven stubble that is left standing, is called qarid. - Wetzst.)).<p>On &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (fut.

Kal). Assured of the truth, in conformity with experience, of that which has been said, he appeals finally to the friends: if it be not so (on &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;  equals  &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488; in conditional clauses, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>), who (by proving the opposite) is able to charge me with lying and bring to nought (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;  equals  &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, Ew. 321, b, perhaps by &#1488;&#1500; being conceived of as originally infin. from &#1488;&#1500;&#1500; (comp. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;), in the sense of non-existence, Arab. 'l-&#8219;adam) my assertion?<p>The bold accusations in the speech of Eliphaz, in which the uncharitableness of the friends attains its height, must penetrate most deeply into Job's spirit. But Job does not answer like by like. Even in this speech in opposition to the friends, he maintains the passionless repose which has once been gained. Although the misjudgment of his character has attained its height in the speech of Eliphaz, his answer does not contain a single bitter personal word. In general, he does not address them, not as though he did not wish to show respect to them, but because he has nothing to say concerning their unjust and wrong conduct that he would not already have said, and because he has lost all hope of his reproof taking effect, all hope of sympathy with his entreaty that they would spare him, all hope of understanding and information on their part.<p>continued...</body></html>
