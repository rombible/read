God will restore his people to their rights, though long kept from them. It has been the common lot of God's people, in all ages, to be reproached and reviled. God shall be worshipped, not only by all Israel, and the strangers who join them, but by the heathen. Remote nations must be reckoned with for the wrongs done to God's people. The sufferings of the insolent and haughty in prosperity, are unpitied and unlamented. But all the desolations of flourishing nations will make way for the overturning Satan's kingdom.

It preaches the nothingness of man, the fruitlessness of his toils, the fleetingness of his hopes and enjoyments, and their baffling when at their height. Grass in a court or on a once beaten road, much more, in a town, speaks of the passing away of what has been, that man was accustomed to be there, and is not, or is there less than he was. It leaves the feeling of void and forsakenness. But in Nineveh not a few tufts of grass here and there shall betoken desolation, it shall be one wild rank pasture, where "flocks" shall not feed only, but "lie down" as in their fold and continual resting place, not in the outskirts only or suburbs, but in the very center of her life and throng and busy activity, "in the midst of her," and none shall fray them away. So Isaiah had said of the cities of Aroer, "they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down and none shall make them afraid" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>, and of Judah until its restoration by Christ, that it should be "a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-2.htm">Jeremiah 6:2</a>). And not only those which are wont to be found in some connection with man, but "all the beasts of a nation" , the troops of wild and savage and unclean beasts which shun the dwellings of man or are his enemies, these in troops have their lair there.<p>Both the cormorant and the bittern - They may be the same. The pelican retires inland to consume its food. Tristram, Houghton, in Smith's Bible Dictionary, "Pelican" note. It could be a hedgehog.<p>Shall lodge in the upper lintels of it. - The "chapiters" (English margin) or capitals of the pillars of the temples and palaces shall lie broken and strewn upon the ground, and among those desolate fragments of her pride shall unclean animals haunt. The pelican has its Hebrew name from vomiting. It vomits up the shells which it had swallowed whole, after they had been opened by the heat of the stomach, and so picks out the animal contained in them , the very image of greediness and uncleanness. It dwells also not in deserts only but near marshes, so that Nineveh is doubly waste.<p>A voice shall sing in the windows - In the midst of the desolation, the muteness of the hedgehog and the pensive loneliness of the solitary pelican, the musing spectator is even startled by the gladness of a bird, joyous in the existence which God has given it. Instead of the harmony of music and men-singers and women-singers in their palaces shall be the sweet music of some lonely bird, unconscious that it is sitting "in the windows" of those, at whose name the world grew pale, portions of the outer walls being all which remain of her palaces. "Desolation" shall be "in the thresholds," sitting, as it were, in them; everywhere to be seen in them; the more, because unseen. Desolation is something oppressive; we "feel" its presence. There, as the warder watch and ward at the empty portals, where once was the fullest throng, shall "desolation sit," that no one enter. "For He shall uncover (hath uncovered, English margin) the cedar-work:" in the roofless palaces, the carved "cedar-work" shall be laid open to wind and rain. Any one must have noticed, how piteous and dreary the decay of any house in a town looks, with the torn paper hanging uselessly on its walls. A poet of our own said niche beautiful ruins of a wasted monastery:<p>"For the gay beams of lightsome day<p>Gild, but to flout the ruins gray."<p>But at Nineveh it is one of the mightiest cities of the world which thus lies waste, and the bared "cedar-work" had, in the days of its greatness, been carried off from the despoiled Lebanon  or Hermon . <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. flocks&#8212;of sheep; answering to "beasts" in the parallel clause. Wide pastures for sheep and haunts for wild beasts shall be where once there was a teeming population (compare Zep 2:6).

In the midst of the city of Nineveh; in the streets of it, where houses stood, and people in great numbers walked; but now only should be seen the cottages of shepherds, and flocks of sheep feeding or lying down, as is before observed of the sea coast of the Philistines, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a>, <p>all the beasts of the nations; that is, all sorts of beasts, especially wild beasts, in the several parts of the world, should come and dwell here; instead of kings and princes, nobles, merchants, and the great men thereof, who once here inhabited, now there should be beasts of prey, terrible to come nigh unto; for these are to be understood properly and literally, and not figuratively, of men, for their savageness and cruelty, comparable to beasts: <p>both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; of the doors of the houses in Nineveh: or, "on its pomegranates" (k); the figures of these being often put on chapiters, turrets, pinnacles, pillars, and posts in buildings, and over porches of doors; and on these those melancholy and doleful creatures here mentioned, which delight in solitary places, should take up their abode. The "cormorant" is the same with the "corvus aquaticus", or "sea raven", about the size of a goose; it builds not only among rocks, but often on trees: what is called the "shagge" is a species of it, or the lesser cormorant, a water fowl common on our northern coasts; is somewhat larger than a common duck, and builds on trees as the common cormorant (l). Bochart (m) takes it to be the "pelican" which is here meant; and indeed, whatever bird it is, it seems to have its name from vomiting; and this is what naturalists (n) observe of the pelican, that it swallows down shell fish, which, being kept awhile in its stomach, are heated, and then it casts them up, which then open easily, and it picks out the flesh of them: and it seems to delight in desolate places, since it is called the pelican of the wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-6.htm">Psalm 102:6</a>. Isidore says (o) it is an Egyptian bird, dwelling in the desert by the river Nile, from whence it has its name; for it is called "canopus Aegyptus"; and the Vulgate Latin version renders the word here "onocrotalus", the same with the pelican; and Montanus translates it the "pelican"; and so do others. The "bittern" is a bird of the heron kind; it is much the size of a common heron; it is usually found in sedgy and reedy places near water, and sometimes in hedges; it makes a very remarkable noise, and, from the singularity of it, the common people imagine it sticks its beak in a reed or in the mud, in order to make it; hence it is sometimes called the "mire drum" (p). It is said it will sometimes make a noise like a bull, or the blowing of a horn, so as to be heard half a German mile, or one hour's journey; hence it is by some called "botaurus", as if "bootaurus", because it imitates the bellowing of a bull (q). The Tigurine version renders it the "castor" or "beaver" (r); but Bochart (s) takes it to be the "hedgehog"; and so the word is rendered in the Vulgate Latin, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, and by others: which is a solitary creature, and drives away all other animals from society with it by its prickles: <p>their voice shall sing in the windows: of desolate houses, the inhabitants being gone who used to be seen looking out of them; but now these creatures before named should dwell here, and utter their doleful sounds, who otherwise would not have come near them: <p>desolation shall be in the thresholds; there being none to go in and out over them. The Septuagint version, and which is followed by the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions, render it, "the ravens shall be in its gates": mistaking  "desolation", for  "a raven": <p>for he shall uncover the cedar work; the enemy Nebuchadnezzar, or Nabopolassar, when he should take the city, would unroof the houses panelled with cedar, and expose all the fine cedar work within to the inclemencies of the air, which would soon come to ruin. All these expressions are designed to set forth the utter ruin and destruction of this vast and populous city; and which was so utterly destroyed, as Lucian says, that there is no trace of it to be found; and, according to modern travellers, there are only heaps of rubbish to be seen, which are conjectured to be the ruins of this city; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>. <p>(k) "in malogranatis ejus", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Tarnovius.

The phrase seems to stand in apposition to <span class="ital">flocks</span>, the idea of which it expands. The word “flocks” seems nowhere to be used of wild creatures, but always of those tended by the shepherd. The term “beasts” is generally used of wild creatures, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1</a> it is used of tame animals, and elsewhere of creatures in general. The term <span class="ital">nation</span> (here <span class="ital">sing</span>.) is used of locusts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-6.htm" title="For a nation is come up on my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the cheek teeth of a great lion.">Joel 1:6</a>), just as “people” is used of the ants and conies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/30-25.htm" title="The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;...">Proverbs 30:25-26</a>), and many assume that it is so used here, rendering, <span class="ital">all kinds of animals in crowds</span> (Keil, R.V. marg.). The construction is against such a sense, and there seems no reason for departing from the ordinary meaning of <span class="ital">nation</span>. Nineveh shall be a common pasture for every tribe of people. On the other hand, Wellhausen appears to take “beasts” in a figurative sense, rendering <span class="ital">a motley medley of people</span>, the reference being to the tribes who own the flocks. But though “beasts” be sometimes used figuratively of peoples, when the idea is to be expressed that they shall attack and devour another people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-9.htm" title="All you beasts of the field, come to devour, yes, all you beasts in the forest.">Isaiah 56:9</a>), in a passage like the present such a sense is entirely unnatural.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cormorant and the bittern</span>] R.V. <span class="ital">pelican and porcupine</span>. The first word is usually supposed to denote the pelican (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-17.htm" title="And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,">Deuteronomy 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm" title="But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out on it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.">Isaiah 34:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-6.htm" title="I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.">Psalm 102:6</a>). Sept. renders the second “hedgehog”; by others it is supposed to mean the bittern (Tristram). For <span class="ital">upper lintels</span>, marg. more literally: <span class="bld">chapiters</span> (so R.V.), that is, the carved tops of the pillars now flung to the ground, or of those still standing amidst the ruins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Their <span class="ital">voice shall sing</span>] lit. <span class="ital">a voice that singeth = hark! they sing!</span> The idea of “singing” is strange; Sept. takes the word in a more general sense of the cry of birds or wild creatures.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">desolation</span> shall be <span class="ital">in the thresholds</span>] Instead of “desolation,” Sept. (with difference of one letter) reads <span class="ital">ravens</span>, a reading which many follow. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm" title="But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out on it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.">Isaiah 34:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">uncover the cedar work</span>] The text is probably in disorder. The term “uncover” is that rendered <span class="ital">rase</span> to the foundation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7</a> (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm" title="You went forth for the salvation of your people, even for salvation with your anointed; you wounded the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation to the neck. Selah.">Habakkuk 3:13</a>). The supposed form rendered “cedar work” does not occur elsewhere. The slightest possible change in pointing would give <span class="ital">her</span> cedar, which might mean, her cedar work. The word, however, might possibly be some form of the verb <span class="ital">to make lean</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-11.htm" title="The LORD will be terrible to them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.">Zephaniah 2:11</a></span>), either 1 pers. impf., <span class="ital">I will make</span> her <span class="ital">void</span> and <span class="ital">rase</span> her, or with Aramaic spelling (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm" title="I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled on my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.">Isaiah 63:3</a>), 3 pers. perf., <span class="ital">they shall make</span> (lit. have made) her <span class="ital">void</span> and <span class="ital">rase</span> her, which is equivalent to the <span class="ital">passive</span> she shall be made void, &c.

The Hebrew will hardly hear Keil's rendering, "all kinds of beasts in crowds." (Compare similar predictions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The cormorant</span> (<span class="accented">kaath</span>); probably <span class="accented">the pelican</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">onocrotalus</span>; the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, which word Schleusner thinks to have been interchanged with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> that follows soon afterwards. Bat in the latter place Jerome has <span class="accented">corvus.</span> The pelican is found in the Assyrian monuments tinder more than one appellation (see 'Transact. of See. of Bibl. Archaeol.,' 8:93, etc., and 141). <span class="cmt_word">The bittern</span> (<span class="accented">kippod</span>). Most recent critics translate this by "hedgehog" or "porcupine." The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ericius.</span> But neither hedgehog nor porcupine utters cries or frequents pools of water, and it may well be doubted whether some marsh-loving bird is not meant. Certainly the following clause suits the habits of a bird better than those of a hedgehog (see 'Bible Educator,' 3:312, where Dr. Tristram is quoted saying, "As a matter of fact, the bittern is very abundant in these swamps of the Tigris, and in all the marshy grounds of Syria; and its strange booming note, disturbing the stillness of the night, gives an idea of desolation which nothing but the wail of the hyena can equal"). No notice of the bittern seems to be found in the Assyrian monuments, though the mention of the heron is not uncommon. The <span class="accented">kaath</span> and <span class="accented">kippod</span> are commonly mentioned together, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>. II. <span class="cmt_word">The upper lintels;</span> "the capitals" of the columns (see note on Amos 9:1, where the same word <span class="accented">kaphtor</span> is used). <span class="cmt_word">Their voice shall sing in the windows;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the voice of the songster in the window.</span> Birds shall perch and sing in the apertures of the ruined palaces.

Others translate, "Hark! it singeth in the windows." There are no traces of windows in any of the Assyrian palaces, even in the case of chambers next the outer walls. If daylight were admitted, it must have entered through openings in the ceilings (Layard, 'Nineveh.' 2:260). Desolation shall be in the thresholds. The word rendered "desolation" (<span class="accented">chorebh</span>) Jerome notes may be read as meaning "sword," "drought." and "raven;" he adopts the last signification, and translates, in agreement with the LXX., <span class="accented">corvus.</span> But it seems best to take the term as signifying "desolation;" no human creature shall be found there, only ruin and rubbish. Ewald renders, "Owls shall sing in the windows, crows on the threshold, 'shivered. crushed.'" For he shall uncover (<span class="accented">he hath laid bare</span>) the cedar work. God, or the enemy, has so destroyed the palaces that the cedar panelling is exposed to the weather. Jerome has, "Attenuabo robur ejus." We see by Sennacherib's boast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>) that the Assyrians imported cedars for building purposes. And we have monumental evidence of the employment of cedar in palaces at least since  the time of Assurnazirpal,  <span class="date">B.C. 860</span>. Esar-haddon reports that he received cypress and cedar from Lebanon as tribute; and Assurbanipal states that in erecting his palace he used cedar pillars from Sirjon and Lebanon (Schrader, 'Die Keilinschrift. und Alt. Test.,' pp. 183, 453). Neriglissar, King of Babylon,  <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>, in rebuilding his palace, records that he "arranged tall cedars for its roof" ('Records of the Past,' 5:142). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And even the best men form no exception to the rule. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>.

In &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; the force of the suffix still continues: the most righteous man among them; and &#1502;&#1503; before &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; is used in a comparative sense: "is more, i.e., worse, than a thorn-hedge." The corruption of the nation has reached such a terrible height, that the judgment must burst in upon them. This thought comes before the prophet's mind, so that he interrupts the description of the corrupt condition of things by pointing to the day of judgment. The "day of thy watch-men," i.e., of thy prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>), is explained in the apposition pequ&#774;dda&#770;thekha&#770; (thy visitation). The perfect &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; is prophetic of the future, which is as certain as if it were already there. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, now, i.e., when this day has come (really therefore  equals  "then"), will their confusion be, i.e., then will the wildest confusion come upon them, as the evil, which now envelopes itself in the appearance of good, will then burst forth without shame and without restraint, and everything will be turned upside down. In the same sense as this Isaiah also calls the day of divine judgment a day of confusion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>). In the allusion to the day of judgment the speaker addresses the people, whereas in the description of the corruption he speaks of them. This distinction thus made between the person speaking and the people is not at variance with the assumption that the prophet speaks in the name of the congregation, any more than the words "thy watchmen, thy visitation," furnish an objection to the assumption that the prophet was one of the watchmen himself. This distinction simply proves that the penitential community is not identical with the mass of the people, but to be distinguished from them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a> the description of the moral corruption is continued, and that in the form of a warning not to trust one another any more, neither companion (&#1512;&#1506;) with whom one has intercourse in life, nor the confidential friend ('allu&#772;ph), nor the most intimate friend of all, viz., the wife lying on the husband's bosom. Even before her the husband was to beware of letting the secrets of his heart cross his lips, because she would betray them. The reason for this is assigned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, in the fact that even the holiest relations of the moral order of the world, the deepest ties of blood-relationship, are trodden under foot, and all the bonds of reverence, love, and chastity are loosened. The son treats his father as a fool (nibbe&#772;l, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>). "The men of his house" (the subject of the last clause) are servants dwelling in the house, not relations (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-17.htm">2 Samuel 12:17-18</a>). This verse is applied by Christ to the period of the &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; which will attend His coming, in His instruction to the apostles in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-35.htm">Matthew 10:35-36</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-53.htm">Luke 12:53</a>). It follows from this, that we have not to regard <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a> as a simple continuation of the description in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2-4</a>, but that these verses contain the explanation of &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1501;, in this sense, that at the outbreak of the judgment and of the visitation the faithlessness will reach the height of treachery to the nearest friends, yea, even of the dissolution of every family tie (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-10.htm">Matthew 24:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-12.htm">Matthew 24:12</a>). </body></html>
