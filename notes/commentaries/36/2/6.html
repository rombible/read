God will restore his people to their rights, though long kept from them. It has been the common lot of God's people, in all ages, to be reproached and reviled. God shall be worshipped, not only by all Israel, and the strangers who join them, but by the heathen. Remote nations must be reckoned with for the wrongs done to God's people. The sufferings of the insolent and haughty in prosperity, are unpitied and unlamented. But all the desolations of flourishing nations will make way for the overturning Satan's kingdom. Let us improve our advantages, and expect the performance of every promise, praying that our Father's name may be hallowed every where, over all the earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The seacoast shall be dwellings and cottages - o, literally, cuttings or diggings. This is the central meaning of the word; the place of the Cherethites (the cutters off) shall be "cheroth" of shepherds, places which they dug up that their flocks might be enclosed therein. The tracts once full of fighting men, the scourge of Judah, should be so desolate of its former people, as to become a sheep-walk. Men of peace should take the place of its warriors.<p>So the shepherds of the Gospel with their flocks have entered into possession of war-like nations, turning them to the Gospel. They are shepherds, the chief of whom is that Good Shepherd, who laid down His Life for the sheep. And these are the sheep of whom He speaks, "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My Voice; and there shall be one fold and One Shepherd" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. dwellings and cottages for shepherds&#8212;rather, "dwellings with cisterns" (that is, water-tanks dug in the earth) for shepherds. Instead of a thick population and tillage, the region shall become a pasturage for nomad shepherds' flocks. The Hebrew for "dug cisterns," Ceroth, seems a play on sounds, alluding to their name Cherethites (Zep 2:5): Their land shall become what their national name implies, a land of cisterns. Maurer translates, "Feasts for shepherds' (flocks)," that is, one wide pasturage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zephaniah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This confirms the former, tells us what shall be in those parts; instead of cities full of rich citizens, there shall be cottages for shepherds watching over their flocks. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/zephaniah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds,.... That tract of land which lay on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, inhabited by the Philistines, should now become so desolate, that instead of towns and cities full of merchants and sea faring persons, and houses full of inhabitants, and warehouses full of goods, there should now only be seen a few huts and cottages for shepherds to dwell in, to shelter them from the heat by day, and where they watched their flocks by night, and took their proper repose and rest. The last word is by some rendered "ditches" (i), which were dug by them to receive rainwater for their use: or rather may signify "cottages dug by shepherds" (k); in subterraneous places, whither they retired in the heat of the day, to shelter themselves from the scorching sun; and some of them were so large as to receive their flocks also; such was the cave of Polyphemus, as Bochart (l) observes, in which the cattle, namely, the sheep and goats, lay down and slept; and in Iceland such are used to secure them from the cold; where we are told (m) there are caverns in the mountains capable of sheltering a hundred sheep or more: and whither they very cordially retreat in bad weather. These holes are in such mountains as have formerly burned, and are of infinite service to them, both winter and summer; in the winter for shelter, and in the summer for very good pastures, which they find in plenty all around. Such sort of huts and cottages as these, in hot countries, Jerom seems to have respect unto, when, speaking of Tekoa, he says (n), there is not beyond it any little village, nor indeed any field cottages like to ovens (subterraneous ones, Calmet (o) calls them), which the Africans call "mapalia": these Sallust (p) describes as of an oblong figure, covered with tiles, and like the keels of ships, or ships turned bottom upwards; and, according to Pliny (q), they were movable, and carried from place to place in carts and waggons; and therefore cannot be such as before described; and so Dr. Shaw (r) says, the Bedouin Arabs now, as their great ancestors the Arabians, live in tents called "hhymas", from the shelter which they afford the inhabitants; and adds, they are the very same which the ancients call "mapalia": <p>and folds for flocks; in which they put them to lie down in at evening. The phrases express the great desolation of the land; that towns should be depopulated, and the land lie untilled, and only be occupied by shepherds, and their flocks, who lead them from place to place, the most convenient for them. <p>(i) "fossas", Tigurine version; "fossuris", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; so Ben Melech; but disapproved of by Gussetius. p. 402.

The Sept. also read differently, the words <span class="ital">the sea coast</span> being wanting in their text. These words should probably be omitted as a marginal explanation of <span class="ital">it</span>, and the verse read, <span class="ital">and it</span> (land of the Philistines, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm" title="Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy you, that there shall be no inhabitant.">Zephaniah 2:5</a></span>) <span class="ital">shall be</span>.…<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dwellings</span> and <span class="ital">cottages for shepherds</span>] R.V. <span class="ital">pastures, with cottages</span>, marg. or, <span class="ital">caves</span>. The word rendered “cottages” (<span class="ital">k’rôth</span>) is obscure. Bochart, whom Keil follows, suggested that the word was <span class="ital">infin</span>. of the verb “to dig,” and rendered “for digging,” supposing that the reference was to subterranean huts dug by the shepherds to escape the heat (hence R.V. marg., <span class="ital">caves</span>). The idea has no probability. The peculiar construction (which appears similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm" title="He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.">Job 20:17</a>, <span class="ital">the floods, the brooks</span> of honey) suggests that “dwellings” and “cottages” are mere variant expressions, having the same meaning. So Hitzig: <span class="ital">shall be for meadows of pastures</span> for shepherds. The sense of <span class="ital">pasture</span> is seen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-23.htm" title="Then shall he give the rain of your seed, that you shall sow the ground with; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall your cattle feed in large pastures.">Isaiah 30:23</a>, though the plur. is <span class="ital">masc.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-13.htm" title="The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.">Psalm 65:13</a>, while in the present passage the word is <span class="ital">fem</span>. It is possible, indeed, that the word is a mere transcriptional duplicate of the preceding word, as the letters forming the two words are frequently confused. The term, however, stood in the text of the Sept., who rendered it <span class="ital">Crete</span>, i.e. the country of the Cherethites: <span class="ital">and Crete shall be a pasture</span> (<span class="ital">n’vath</span>) <span class="ital">of shepherds</span>. Either the order of words was different in the text of the Sept., or they translated in entire disregard of Shemitic grammar.

Neale, "The road from Gaza to Askalon lay along the sea shore. In the winter months many parts of it are impracticable, owing to the encroachment of the sea. The surf then dashes wildly into the huge caverns worked out of the endless sand hills that line this coast. These caverns were tenanted, when we passed, by goatherds and their flocks. Thither they resort for shelter from the fierce heat of the noontide sun; and here during the night the goats are penned. There are wells and reservoirs in the vicinity which furnish water for the flocks the whole year round, and the brambles and thorn bushes that flourish near the seaside form their pasturage" ('Eight Years in Syria,' 1:40, 41).

Hashme&#772;m (an uncontracted form; see Ges. 67, Anm. 10), devastando, is attached to the preceding verb in an adverbial sense, as a practical exemplification, like the &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-24.htm">Leviticus 26:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-28.htm">Leviticus 26:28</a>, which Micah had in his eye at the time.
