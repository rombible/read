God will restore his people to their rights, though long kept from them. It has been the common lot of God's people, in all ages, to be reproached and reviled. God shall be worshipped, not only by all Israel, and the strangers who join them, but by the heathen. Remote nations must be reckoned with for the wrongs done to God's people. The sufferings of the insolent and haughty in prosperity, are unpitied and unlamented. But all the desolations of flourishing nations will make way for the overturning Satan's kingdom. Let us improve our advantages, and expect the performance of every promise, praying that our Father's name may be hallowed every where, over all the earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This shall they have for their pride - Literally, "This to them instead of their pride." Contempt and shame shall be the residue of the proud man; the exaltation shall be gone, and all which they shall gain to themselves shall be shame. Moab and Ammon are the types of heretics . As they were akin to the people of God, but hating it; akin to Abraham through a lawless birth, but ever molesting the children of Abraham, so heretics profess to believe in Christ, to be children of Christ, and yet ever seek to overthrow the faith of Christians. As the Church says, "My mothers children are" "angry with me" Sol 1:5. They seem to have escaped the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah (pagan sins), and to have found a place of refuge (Zoar); and yet they are in darkness and cannot see the light of faith; and in an unlawful manner they mingle, against all right, the falsehood of Satan with the truth of God; so that their doctrines become, in part, "doctrines of devils," in part have some stamp of the original truth.<p>To them, as to the Jews, our Lord says, "Ye are of your father the devil." While they profess to be children of God, they claim by their names to have God for their Father (Moab) and to be of His people (Ammon), while in hatred to His true children they forfeit both. As Moab seduced Israel, so they the children of the Church. They too enlarge themselves against the borders of the Church, rending off its children and making themselves the Church. They too utter reproaches and revilings against it. "Take away their revilings," says an early father , "against the law of Moses, and the prophets, and God the Creator, and they have not a word to utter." They too  "remove the old landmarks which the fathers" (the prophets and Apostles) "have set." And so, barrenness is their portion; as, after a time, heretics ever divide, and do not multiply; they are a desert, being out of the Church of God: and at last the remnant of Judah, the Church, possesses them, and absorbs them into herself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

All lie in wait for blood, they hunt every man his brother with the net. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a>. Their hands are after evil, to make it good. The prince asks, and the judge is for reward; and the great man, he speaks the evil of his soul: and they twist it together." The grape and the early fig signify the good and the righteous man. &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491; is not the God-fearing man, but, according to the context, the man who cherishes love and fidelity. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, not "to have perished," but to be lost, to have disappeared. &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, not "out of the land," but, as the parallel &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; shows, from the earth, out of the world. For the fact itself, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>. They all lie in wait for blood, i.e., not that they all go about committing murder, but simply that they set their minds upon quarrels, cheating, and treachery, that they may rob their neighbour of his means of existence, so that he must perish (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2-3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>); at the same time, even murderous thoughts are not excluded. The same thing is implied in the hunting with the net. &#1488;&#1495;, the brother, is the fellow-countryman (for this figure, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-9.htm">Psalm 10:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-7.htm">Psalm 35:7-8</a>, etc.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a> the words from &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; to &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; are not to be joined to what follows so as to form one sentence. Such a combination is not only opposed to the accents, but is at variance with the structure of the whole verse, which consists of several short clauses, and it does not even yield a natural thought; consequently Ewald proposes to alter the text (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;). &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; is hardly the inf. hiph. "to do evil," but most likely a noun with the article, "the evil;" and the thought is therefore either "both hands are (sc., busy) with evil," or "both hands are stretched out to evil," to make it good, i.e., to carry out the evil well (&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-33.htm">Jeremiah 2:33</a>), or to give evil such a form that it shall appear to be good, or right. This thought is then made special: the prince, the judge, and the great man, i.e., the rich man and mighty man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>), weave a thing to make evil good. &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, to weave, to twist together, after &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, twist or string. The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is to be found in the three classes already named, and not merely in the judge and the great man. There is just as little reason for this limitation as for the assumption that the great man and the prince are one person. The way in which the three twist the thing or the evil plan together is indicated in the statements of the three previous clauses. The prince asks, sc. for the condemnation of a righteous or innocent man; and the judge grants this for recompense against compensation; and the rich man co-operates by speaking havvath napsho&#772;. Havva&#770;h in most passages is universally allowed to signify hurt, mischief, destruction; and the only question is, whether this meaning is to be traced to &#1492;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, to breathe (Hupfeld on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a>), or to &#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, to occur, an occurrence, then specially an evil occurrence (Hengstenberg, Diss. on the Pentateuch, vol. i. p. 252). Only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a> and the passage before us is havva&#770;h said to signify desire in a bad sense, or evil lust. But, as Caspari has shown, the meaning is neither necessary nor established in either of these two passages. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a> the meaning aerumna activa aliisque inferenda is quite sufficient; and C. B. Michaelis has adopted it for the present passage: "The great man speaks the mischief of his soul," i.e., the injury or destruction of another, for which he cherishes a desire. Nephesh, the soul as the seat of desire. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is not introduced to strengthen the suffix attached to &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, "of his, yea of his soul" (Ewald, Hitzig, Umbreit); for not only are the accents against this, but also the thought, which requires no such strengthening. It is an emphatic repetition of the subject hagga&#770;do&#772;l. The great man weaves evil with the king and judge, by desiring it, and expressing the desire in the most open manner, and thereby giving to the thing an appearance of right. </body></html>
