God will restore his people to their rights, though long kept from them. It has been the common lot of God's people, in all ages, to be reproached and reviled. God shall be worshipped, not only by all Israel, and the strangers who join them, but by the heathen. Remote nations must be reckoned with for the wrongs done to God's people. The sufferings of the insolent and haughty in prosperity, are unpitied and unlamented. But all the desolations of flourishing nations will make way for the overturning Satan's kingdom. Let us improve our advantages, and expect the performance of every promise, praying that our Father's name may be hallowed every where, over all the earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "woe" having been pronounced on the five cities apart, now falls upon the whole nation of the Cherethites or Philistines. The Cherethites are only named as equivalent to the Philistines, probably as originally a distinct immigration of the same people . The name is used by the Egyptian slave of the Amalekite <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a> for those whom the author of the first book of Samuel calls Philistines <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-16.htm">1 Samuel 30:16</a>. Ezekiel uses the name parallel with that of "Philistines," with reference to the destruction which God would bring upon them .<p>The word of the Lord - Comes not to them, but "upon" them, overwhelming them. To them He speaketh not in good, but in evil; not in grace, but in anger; not in mercy, but in vengeance. Philistia was the first enemy of the Church. It showed its enmity to Abraham and Isaac and would fain that they should not sojourn among them <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-34.htm">Genesis 21:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-14.htm">Genesis 26:14-15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-28.htm">Genesis 26:28</a>. They were the hindrance that Israel should not go straight to the promised land <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17</a>. When Israel passed the Red Sea <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>, "sorrow" took hold of them." They were close to salvation in body, but far in mind. They are called "Canaan," as being a chief nation of it <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-21.htm">Genesis 15:21</a>, and in that name lay the original source of their destruction. They inherited the sins of Canaan and with them his curse, preferring the restless beating of the barren, bitter sea on which they dwelt, "the waves of this troublesome world," to being a part of the true Canaan. They would absorb the Church into the world, and master it, subduing it to the pagan Canaan, not subdue themselves to it, and become part of the heavenly Canaan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. inhabitants of the seacoast&#8212;the Philistines dwelling on the strip of seacoast southwest of Canaan.

Which is a name of the Philistines in general, as Kimchi and Ben Melech; or these were a particular tribe belonging to them, that inhabited the southern part of their country; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a> those on the sea coast, the coast of the Mediterranean sea, and so lay between that and Judea: out of this nation, in the times of David and Solomon, were some choice soldiers selected, called the Cherethites and Pelethites, who were their bodyguards, as Josephus (a) calls them; a royal band, which never departed from the king's person; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>. The Septuagint version calls them "strangers of the Cretians"; and are thought by some to be a colony of the Cretians; a people that came originally from the island of Crete, and settled here; but, on the contrary, rather Crete was a colony of the Philistines, and had its name from them; for by the Arabians (b), the country of Palestine, or the Philistines, is called Keritha; and by the Syrians Creth; and, by the Hebrews the inhabitants thereof are called Cherethites, as here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a> and so the south of the Cherethites, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>, is, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>, called the land of the Philistines. In all the above places, where they are spoken of as the attendants of Solomon and David, they are in the Targum called "archers"; and it is a clear case the Philistines were famous for archery, whereby they had sometimes the advantage of their enemies; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a> and bows and arrows were the arms the Cretians made use of, and were famous for, as Bochart (c) from various writers has shown; the use of which they learned very probably from the Philistines, from whom they sprung; though Solinus (d) says they were the first that used arrows; and, according to Diodorus Siculus, Saturn introduced the art of using bows and arrows into the island of Crete; though others ascribe it to Apollo (e); and it is said that Hercules learnt this art from Rhadamanthus of Crete; which last instance seems to favour the notion of those, that these Cherethites were Cretians, or sprung from them; to which the Septuagint version inclines; and Calmet (f) is of opinion that Caphtor, from whence the Philistines are said to come, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a> and who are called the remnant of the country of Caphtor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a> is the island of Crete; and that the Philistines came from thence into Palestine; and that the Cherethites are the ancient Cretians; the language, manners, arms, religion and gods, of the Cretians and Philistines, being much the same; though so they might be, as being a colony of the Philistines; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a> though a learned man (1), who gives into the opinion that these were royal guards, yet thinks they were not strangers and idolaters, but proselytes to the Jewish religion at least; and rather Israelites, choice selected men, men of strength and valour, of military courage and skill, picked out of the nation, to guard the king's person; and who were called Cherethites and Pelethites, from the kind of shields and targets they wore, called "cetra" and "pelta": and it is a notion several of the Jewish writers (2) have, that they were two families in Israel; but it seems plain and evident that a foreign nation is here meant, which lay on the sea coast, and belonged to the Philistines. Another learned man (g) thinks they are the Midianites, the same with the Cretians that Luke joins with the Arabians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-11.htm">Acts 2:11</a> as the Midianites are with the Arabians and Amalekites by Josephus (h); however, a woe is denounced against them, and they are threatened with desolation. The Vulgate Latin version is, "a nation of destroyed ones": and the Targum, <p>"a people who have sinned, that they might be destroyed:'' <p>the word of the Lord is against you; inhabitants of the sea coast, the Cherethites; the word of the Lord conceived in his own mind, his purpose to destroy them, which cannot be frustrated. So the Targum, <p>"the decree of the word of the Lord is against you;'' <p>and the word pronounced by his lips, the word of prophecy concerning them, by the mouth of former prophets, as Isaiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a> and by the mouth of the present prophet: <p>O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; Palestine was a part of Canaan; the five lordships of the Philistines before mentioned belonged originally to the Canaanite, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a> and these belonged to the land of Israel, though possessed by them, out of which now they should be turned, and the country wasted, as follows: <p>I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant; so great should be the desolation; all should be removed from it, either by death or by captivity; at least there should be no settled inhabitant. <p>(a) Antiqu. l. 7. c. 5. sect. 4. and c. 11. sect. 8.

Warren, "consists of an undulating plain from fifty to a hundred feet above the level of the sea, reaching thirty-two miles from Ekron to Gaza, with a breadth of from nine to sixteen miles. To the east of this the hills commence, not the hill country, but a series of low spurs and undulating ground, culminating in hogs' backs, running nearly north and south, and rising in places to twelve hundred feet above the ocean" ('Survey Memoirs: Jerusalem,' p. 436). <span class="cmt_word">The nation of the Cherethites.</span> So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>.

Part of David's bodyguard was composed of the same people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). The name seems to have belonged to a portion of the Philistines who inhabited the southern part of the district. "One of the principal villages of Philistia is now called <span class="accented">Keretiya</span>, so that the term may apply to the inhabitants of this town - an ancient Cherith not mentioned in the Bible" (Courier's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 237).

The suffix refers to the people, not of the capital only, but, as we may see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>, of the whole of the kingdom of Judah. Hashme&#772;m (an uncontracted form; see Ges. 67, Anm. 10), devastando, is attached to the preceding verb in an adverbial sense, as a practical exemplification, like the &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-24.htm">Leviticus 26:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-28.htm">Leviticus 26:28</a>, which Micah had in his eye at the time.
