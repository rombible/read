So Judah was carried away out of their land.">2 Kings 25:21</a>, we read of the fulfilling of both these particulars; the sons of King Zedekiah, and the principal officers of the state, being slain by the order of the king of Babylon. <span class="ital">And all such as are clothed with strange apparel — </span>Used for idolatrous purposes: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-11.htm" title="You shall not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together.">Deuteronomy 22:11</a>. There were peculiar vestments belonging to the worship of each idol; hence the command of Jehu, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-22.htm" title="And he said to him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.

Thus the Chaldee paraphrast interprets it of those who walked after the laws or rites of the Philistines. Capellus, however, understands it of those who invaded the house of their neighbours, joyfully bounding on the threshold. “This sense is favoured by what follows.” — Newcome. <span class="ital">Which fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit — </span>Who enter into other men’s houses, and take away their goods by fraud or violence, and carry them to the houses of their masters.

The Jewish royal family shall be reckoned with for their pride and vanity; and those that leap on the threshold, invading their neighbours' rights, and seizing their possessions. The trading people and the rich merchants are called to account. Secure and careless people are reckoned with. They are secure and easy; they say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil; that is, they deny his dispensing rewards and punishments. But in the day of the Lord's judgment, it will clearly appear that those who perish, fall a sacrifice to Divine justice for breaking God's law, and because they have no interest by faith in the Redeemer's atoning sacrifice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will punish - (Literally, visit upon). God seems oftentimes to be away from His own world. People plot, design, say, in word or in deed, "who is Lord over us?" God is, as it were, a stranger in it, or as a man, who hath "taken a journey into afar country." God uses our own language to us. "I will visit," inspecting (so to say), examining, sifting, reviewing, and when man's sins require it, allowing the weight of His displeasure to fall upon them.<p>The princes - The prophet again, in vivid detail (as his characteristic is), sets forth together sin and punishment. Amid the general chastisement of all, when all should become one sacrifice, they who sinned most should be punished most. The evil priests had received their doom. Here he begins anew with the mighty of the people and so goes down, first to special spots of the city, then to the whole, man by man. Josiah being a godly king, no mention is made of him. Thirteen years before his death, he received the promise of God, "because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord - I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered unto thy grave in peace, and thou shalt not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19-20</a>. In remarkable contrast to Jeremiah, who had to be, in detail and continual pleading with his people, a prophet of judgment to come, until these judgments broke upon them, and so was the reprover of the evil sovereigns who succeeded Josiah, Zephaniah has to pronounce God's judgments only on the "princes" and "the king's children."<p>Jeremiah, in his inaugural vision, was forewarned, that "the kings Judah, its princes, priests, and the people of the land" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a> should war against him, because he should speak unto them all which God should command him. And thenceforth, Jeremiah impleads or threatens kings and the princes together <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-9.htm">Jeremiah 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21</a>. Zephaniah contrariwise, his office lying wholly within the reign of Josiah, describes the princes again as "roaring lions" <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>, but says nothing of the king, as neither does Micah M<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9</a>, in the reign, it may be, of Jotham or Hezekiah. Isaiah speaks of princes, as "rebellious and companions of thieves" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>. Jeremiah speaks of them as idolaters <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-21.htm">Jeremiah 44:21</a>. They appear to have had considerable influence, which on one occasion they employed in defense of Jeremiah Jer 26:16, but mostly for evil <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a>. Zedekiah inquired of Jeremiah secretly for fear of them <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14-27</a>. They brought destruction upon themselves by what men praise, their resistance to Nebuchadnezzar, but against the declared mind of God. Nebuchadnezzar unwittingly fulfilled the prophets' word, when he "slew all the nobles of Judah, the eunuch who was over the war, and seven men of them that were near the king's person, and the principal scribe of the host" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25-27</a>.<p>And the king's children - Holy Scripture mentions chief persons only by name. Isaiah had prophesied the isolated lonely loveless lot of descendants of Hezekiah who should be "eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a>, associated only with those intriguing pests of Eastern courts, a lot in itself worse than the sword (although to Daniel God overruled it to good) and Zedekiah's sons were slain before his eyes and his race extinct. Jehoiakim died a disgraced death, and Jehoiachin was imprisoned more than half the life of man.<p>And all such as are clothed with strange apparel - Israel was reminded by its dress, that it belonged to God. It was no great thing in itself; "a band of dark blue <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a> upon the fringes at the four corners of their garments." But "the band of dark blue" was upon the high priest's mitre, with the plate engraved, "Holiness to the Lord" <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>, fastened upon it; "with a band of dark blue" also was the breastplate <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-21.htm">Exodus 39:21</a> bound to the ephod of the high priest. So then, simple as it was, it seems to have designated the whole nation, as "a kingdom of priests, an holy nation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>. It was appointed to them, "that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them, and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring; that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God" <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39-40</a>. They might say, "it is but "a band of blue;"" but the "band of blue" was the soldier's badge, which marked them as devoted to the service of their God; indifference to or shame of it involved indifference to or shame of the charge given them therewith, and to their calling as a peculiar people. The choice of the strange apparel involved the choice to be as the nations of the world; "we will be as the pagan, as the families of the countries" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-33.htm">Ezekiel 20:33</a>.<p>All luxurious times copy foreign dress, and with it, foreign manners and luxuries; from where even the pagan Romans were zealous against its use. It is very probable that with the foreign dress foreign idolatry was imported . The Babylonian dress was very gorgeous, such as was the admiration of the simpler Jews. "Her captains and rulers clothed in perfection, girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing dyed attire upon their heads" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-15.htm">Ezekiel 23:15</a>. Ezekiel had to frame words to express the Hebrew idea of their beauty. Jehoiakim is reproved among other things for his luxury <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14-15</a>. Outward dress always betokens the inward mind, and in its turn acts upon it. An estranged dress betokened an estranged heart, from where it is used as an image of the whole spiritual mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>. Jerome: "The garment of the sons of the king and the apparel of princes which we receive in Baptism, is Christ, according to that, "Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ," and "Put ye on bowels of mercy, goodness, humililty, patience," and the rest. Wherein, we are commanded to be clothed with the new man from heaven according to our Creator, and to "lay aside" the clothing of "the old man with his deeds" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>. Whereas, then we ought to be clothed in such raiment, for mercy we put on cruelty, for patience, impatience, for righteousness, iniquity; in a word, for virtues, vices, for Christ, antichrist. Whence it is said of such an one, "He is clothed with cursing as with a garment" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-17.htm">Psalm 109:17</a>. These the Lord will visit most manifestly at His Coming." Rup.: "Thinkest thou that hypocrisy is "strange apparel?" Of a truth. For what stranger apparel than sheeps' clothing to ravening wolves? What stranger than for him who "within is full of iniquity, to appear outwardly righteous before men?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-28.htm">Matthew 23:28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the princes&#8212;who ought to have been an example of good to others, but were ringleaders in all evil.<p>the king's children&#8212;fulfilled on Zedekiah's children (Jer 39:6); and previously, on Jehoahaz and Eliakim, the sons of Josiah (2Ki 23:31, 36; 2Ch 36:6; compare also 2Ki 20:18; 21:13).

The royal family, not specially the sons of Josiah, who, if they were then in existence, must have been mere children, but princes of the royal house. The reference may be particularly to the sons of the king reigning when the judgment fell (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). The king himself is not mentioned as subject to the judgment, inasmuch as he was pious and obedient (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27</a>, etc.). In the mention of these "children" Keil finds proof of the late origin of the prophecy. Such as are clothed with strange apparel. This clause must represent the sin for which the princes are "visited." "Strange" apparel means "foreign" apparel, and this implied foreign manners and habits. The Israelites were reminded by their very dress that they were a peculiar people, consecrated to God's service (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-37.htm">Numbers 15:37</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>). These nobles, however, assumed the dress of the Egyptians and other nations with which they came in contact, and, despising their own national customs, copied the manners and vices of foreigners (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>; 1 Macc. 1:11-15). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But if Israel conquer the nations in such a way as this, then will Jehovah fulfil the peace of His people by the destruction of all the instruments of war, and the extermination of everything of an idolatrous nature, as well as by the judgment of wrath upon all resisting nations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10</a>. "And it comes to pass in that day, is the saying of Jehovah, that I will destroy thy horses out of the midst of thee, and annihilate thy chariots. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11</a>. And I shall destroy the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy fortresses. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-12.htm">Micah 5:12</a>. And I shall destroy the witchcrafts out of thy hand; and cloud-interpreters shall not be left to thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-13.htm">Micah 5:13</a>. And I shall destroy thy graven images and thy statutes out of the midst of thee; and thou wilt no more worship the work of thy hands. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-14.htm">Micah 5:14</a>. And I shall root out thine idol-groves out of the midst of thee, and destroy thy cities. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-15.htm">Micah 5:15</a>. And I shall execute vengeance in wrath and fury upon the nations which have not heard." These verses do not explain <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>, or state how the extermination of the enemy is to take place, or how Israel is made into a lion destroying the nations that are hostile to it, namely, by the fact that the Lord eradicates from its heart all confidence in horses, chariots, and fortifications, in witchcraft and idolatry (Caspari). This assumption is at variance with the words themselves, and with the strophic arrangement of the chapter. There is nothing about trust in horses, etc., but simply about the extermination of the horses, and everything else in which the idolatrous nation had sought its strength. Moreover, the expression &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, when compared with &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6</a>, shows at once that these verses are intended to depict the last and greatest effect produced by the coming of the Prince of peace in Israel, and overthrows Hengstenberg's assumption, that the prophet here foretels the destructive work of the Lord in Israel, which will precede the destruction of the enemy predicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10</a>. In that case &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; would mean "before that day," a meaning which it can never have. The prophet passes rather from the attitude of Israel among the nations, to the description of the internal perfection of the kingdom of God, which does indeed stand in a reciprocal relation to the former and proceed simultaneously with it, but which will not be completed till after the victorious suppression of the foe. Only when the people of God shall have gained the supremacy over all their enemies, will the time have arrived for all the instruments of war to be destroyed. When the world shall be overcome, then will all war cease. The ancient Israel did indeed put its trust in war-horses, and war-chariots, and fortifications (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>); but the Messianic Israel, or the true people of the Lord, will only put its trust in such things so far as it is not yet pervaded by the power of the peace brought by the Messiah. And the more it appropriates the spiritual power of the Prince of peace, the more will the trust in horses and chariots disappear; so that they will be destroyed, because all war comes to an end (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4-6</a>). And the extermination of everything of an idolatrous nature will go hand in hand with this. Two kinds are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-12.htm">Micah 5:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-13.htm">Micah 5:13</a>, viz., witchcraft and the worship of idols of their own making. As objects of witchcraft there are mentioned kesha&#770;ph&#305;&#772;m, lit., witchcrafts of different kinds, but the expression &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498; limits them to such as are performed with the hand, and me&#8219;o&#772;nen&#305;&#772;m ( equals  &#8219;o&#772;nen&#305;&#772;m in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6</a>), lit., cloud-interpreters, or cloud, i.e., storm makers, from &#8219;a&#770;nan, a kind of witchcraft which cannot be more precisely defined (see Delitzsch on Isaiah, l.c.). Of the objects of the idolatrous worship there are mentioned (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>) pes&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, idols made of wood or metal; and &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, stone-images, or stones dedicated to idols (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>).
