The servants of God all proclaim, There is no peace for the wicked. The expressions are figurative, speaking every where desolation; the land shall be left without inhabitants. The sinners to be consumed are, the professed idolaters, and those that worship Jehovah and idols, or swear to the Lord, and to Malcham. Those that think to divide their affections and worship between God and idols, will come short of acceptance with God; for what communion can there be between light and darkness? If Satan have half, he will have all; if the Lord have but half, he will have none. Neglect of God shows impiety and contempt. May none of us be among those who draw back unto perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And them that are turned back from - (Literally, have turned themselves back from following after) the Lord From this half-service, the prophet goes on to the avowed neglect of God, by such as wholly fall away from Him, not setting His will or law before them, "but turning away from" Him. It is their misery that they were set in the right way once, but themselves "turned themselves back," now no longer "following" God, but "their own lusts, drawn away and enticed" <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a> by them. How much more Christians, before whose eyes Christ Jesus is set forth, not as a Redeemer only but as an Example that they should "follow His steps!" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>.<p>And those that have not sought the Lord, nor inquired for Him - This is marked to be a distinct class. "And those who." These did not openly break with God, or turn away overtly from Him; they kept (as men think) on good terms with Him, but, like "the slothful servant," rendered Him a listless heartless service. Both words express diligent search. God is not found then in a careless way. They who "seek" Him not "diligently" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-8.htm">Matthew 2:8</a>, do not find Him. "Strive," our Lord says, "to enter in at the strait gate, for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24</a>. She who had lost the one piece of silver, "sought" "diligently" <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-8.htm">Luke 15:8</a>, until she had found it.<p>Thus, he has gone through the whole cycle. First, that most horrible and cruel worship of Baal, the idolatrous priests and those who had the name of priests only, mingled with them, yet not openly apostatizing; then the milder form of idolatry, the star-worshipers; then those who would unite the worship of God with idols, who held themselves to be worshipers of God, but whose real king was their idol; then those who openly abandoned God; and lastly those who held with Him, just to satisfy their conscience-qualms, but with no heart-service. And so, in words of Habakkuk and in reminiscence of his awful summons of the whole world before God, he sums up; <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Who once were worshippers of him, but now become apostates, and had turned their backs on him and his worship. Some think this describes those who renewed their covenant with God in Josiah's time, and after that revolted from him, who must be very abominable to him; and therefore he threatens to stretch out his hand, and pour out his wrath upon them: <p>and those that have not sought the Lord, nor inquired for him; profane abandoned sinners, that lived without God in the world, and as if there was no God; never concerned themselves about the worship of him, having no faith in him, love to him, or fear and reverence of him; so far were they from seeking him in the first place diligently, zealously, and with their whole heart, that they never sought him at all; nor took any pains to get any knowledge of him, or of his mind and will, and manner of worship; but were altogether careless about these things, and unconcerned for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zephaniah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/zephaniah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. In this verse also one class of persons is described in two ways: those who have turned away from Jehovah and who do not seek Him.

The chief classes mentioned in these two verses are three, viz. the open idolaters, the syncretists who mingled the worship of Baal with that of Jehovah, and those who despised religion altogether. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But if Israel conquer the nations in such a way as this, then will Jehovah fulfil the peace of His people by the destruction of all the instruments of war, and the extermination of everything of an idolatrous nature, as well as by the judgment of wrath upon all resisting nations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10</a>. "And it comes to pass in that day, is the saying of Jehovah, that I will destroy thy horses out of the midst of thee, and annihilate thy chariots. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11</a>. And I shall destroy the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy fortresses. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-12.htm">Micah 5:12</a>. And I shall destroy the witchcrafts out of thy hand; and cloud-interpreters shall not be left to thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-13.htm">Micah 5:13</a>. And I shall destroy thy graven images and thy statutes out of the midst of thee; and thou wilt no more worship the work of thy hands. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-14.htm">Micah 5:14</a>. And I shall root out thine idol-groves out of the midst of thee, and destroy thy cities. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-15.htm">Micah 5:15</a>. And I shall execute vengeance in wrath and fury upon the nations which have not heard." These verses do not explain <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>, or state how the extermination of the enemy is to take place, or how Israel is made into a lion destroying the nations that are hostile to it, namely, by the fact that the Lord eradicates from its heart all confidence in horses, chariots, and fortifications, in witchcraft and idolatry (Caspari). This assumption is at variance with the words themselves, and with the strophic arrangement of the chapter. There is nothing about trust in horses, etc., but simply about the extermination of the horses, and everything else in which the idolatrous nation had sought its strength. Moreover, the expression &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, when compared with &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6</a>, shows at once that these verses are intended to depict the last and greatest effect produced by the coming of the Prince of peace in Israel, and overthrows Hengstenberg's assumption, that the prophet here foretels the destructive work of the Lord in Israel, which will precede the destruction of the enemy predicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10</a>. In that case &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; would mean "before that day," a meaning which it can never have. The prophet passes rather from the attitude of Israel among the nations, to the description of the internal perfection of the kingdom of God, which does indeed stand in a reciprocal relation to the former and proceed simultaneously with it, but which will not be completed till after the victorious suppression of the foe. Only when the people of God shall have gained the supremacy over all their enemies, will the time have arrived for all the instruments of war to be destroyed. When the world shall be overcome, then will all war cease. The ancient Israel did indeed put its trust in war-horses, and war-chariots, and fortifications (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>); but the Messianic Israel, or the true people of the Lord, will only put its trust in such things so far as it is not yet pervaded by the power of the peace brought by the Messiah. And the more it appropriates the spiritual power of the Prince of peace, the more will the trust in horses and chariots disappear; so that they will be destroyed, because all war comes to an end (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4-6</a>). And the extermination of everything of an idolatrous nature will go hand in hand with this. Two kinds are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-12.htm">Micah 5:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-13.htm">Micah 5:13</a>, viz., witchcraft and the worship of idols of their own making. As objects of witchcraft there are mentioned kesha&#770;ph&#305;&#772;m, lit., witchcrafts of different kinds, but the expression &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498; limits them to such as are performed with the hand, and me&#8219;o&#772;nen&#305;&#772;m ( equals  &#8219;o&#772;nen&#305;&#772;m in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6</a>), lit., cloud-interpreters, or cloud, i.e., storm makers, from &#8219;a&#770;nan, a kind of witchcraft which cannot be more precisely defined (see Delitzsch on Isaiah, l.c.). Of the objects of the idolatrous worship there are mentioned (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>) pes&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, idols made of wood or metal; and &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, stone-images, or stones dedicated to idols (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>).
