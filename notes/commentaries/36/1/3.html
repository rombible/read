The servants of God all proclaim, There is no peace for the wicked. The expressions are figurative, speaking every where desolation; the land shall be left without inhabitants. The sinners to be consumed are, the professed idolaters, and those that worship Jehovah and idols, or swear to the Lord, and to Malcham. Those that think to divide their affections and worship between God and idols, will come short of acceptance with God; for what communion can there be between light and darkness? If Satan have half, he will have all; if the Lord have but half, he will have none. Neglect of God shows impiety and contempt. May none of us be among those who draw back unto perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The stumbling-blocks with the wicked - Not only shall the wicked be utterly brought to an end, or, in the other meaning of the word, "gathered into bundles to be taken away," but all causes of stumbling too; everything, through which others can fall, which will not be until the end of all things. Then, he repeats, yet more emphatically, "I will cut off the whole race of man from the face of the earth," and then he closes the verse, like the foregoing, with the solemn words, "saith the Lord." All this shall be fulfilled in the Day of Judgment, and all other fulfillments are earnests of the final Judgment. They are witnesses of the ever-living presence of the Judge of all, that God does take account of man's deeds. They speak to men's conscience, they attest the existence of a divine law, and therewith of the future complete manifestation of that law, of which they are individual sentences. Not until the prophet has brought this circle of judgments to their close, does he pass on to the particular judgments on Judah and Jerusalem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Wicked men for their sins, and beasts for the sins of men; and, as a punishment for them, the creatures whom they have abused to the gratifying of their lusts: <p>I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea; so that there shall be none for the use of man, which are both delicate food; the latter were not consumed at the general deluge. Kimchi thinks this is said by way of hyperbole; but it is possible for these to be consumed, as men by famine, pestilence, and captivity, and beasts by murrain; so the fowls of the air by the noisomeness of it; and the fishes of the sea, that is, such as were in the sea of Tiberias, and other lakes in Judea, by the stagnation of the waters, or by some disease sent among them; unless wicked men, comparable to them, are intended; though they are expressly mentioned, both before and after: <p>and the stumblingblocks with the wicked: that is, idols, which are stumblingblocks to men, and cause them to offend and fall; these, together with those that made them, and the priests that sacrificed unto them, and the people that worshipped them, should be consumed from off the land: or, "the stumblingblocks of the wicked"; for is sometimes used as a sign of the genitive case, as Noldius (i) observes; and so the Vulgate Latin version and the Targum render it: <p>and I will cut off men from off the land, saith the Lord: this is repeated for the certainty of it; or else this designs another sort of men from the former; and that, as before wicked men are designed, here such as are not perfectly wicked, as Kimchi observes; yea, the righteous should be carried captive, so that the land should be left desolate, without men, good or bad; for even good men may fall in a general calamity, and be cut off from the land, though not from the Lord. The Septuagint indeed here render it wicked men. The phrase, "saith the Lord", is twice expressed, for the certain confirmation of it; for it may be concluded it will be, since God has said it again and again that it shall be. <p>(i) Ebr. Concord.

But the clause introduces an idea not in harmony with the rest of the verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Man and beast</span>, etc This is not mere hyperbole to express the utter wasting and destruction that were impending, but points to the mysterious connection between man and the lower creation, how in agreement with the primal curse even material nature suffers for man's sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>).

"And the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many nations like dew from Jehovah, like drops of rain upon grass, which tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for children of men. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>. And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many nations, like the lion among the beasts of the forest, like the young lion among the flocks of sheep; which, when it goes through, treads down, and tears in pieces, without deliverer. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>. High be thy hand above thine oppressors, and may all thine enemies be rooted out." Two things are predicted here. In the first place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a>), Israel will come upon many nations, like a refreshing dew from Jehovah, which falls plentifully in drops upon the grass, and will produce and promote new and vigorous life among them. Dew is here, as indeed everywhere else, a figurative expression for refreshing, stimulating, enlivening (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>). The spiritual dew, which Jacob will bring to the nations, comes from Jehovah, and falls in rich abundance without the cooperation of men. Without the spiritual dew from above, the nations are grass (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; does not refer to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;, but to the principal idea of the preceding clause, viz., to &#1496;&#1500;, to which the explanatory &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is subordinate. As the falling of the dew in rain-drops upon the grass does not depend upon the waiting of men, but proceeds from Jehovah; so will the spiritual blessing, which will flow over from Israel upon the nations, not depend upon the waiting of the nations, but will flow to them against and beyond their expectation. This does not deny the fact that the heathen wait for the salvation of Jehovah, but simply expresses the thought that the blessings will not be measured by their expectation. Secondly (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), the rescued Israel will prove itself a terrible power among the nations, and one to which they will be obliged to succumb. No proof is needed that <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a> do not state in what way Israel will refresh the heathen, as Hitzig supposes. The refreshing dew and the rending lion cannot possibly be synonymous figures. The similarity of the introduction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a> points of itself to something new. To the nations Christ is set for the rising and falling of many (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>). The people of God shows itself like a lion, trampling and rending the sheep among the nations of the world which oppose its beneficent work. And over these may it triumph. This wish (ta&#770;ro&#772;m is optative) closes the promise of the attitude which Israel will assume among the nations of the world. For ta&#770;ro&#772;m ya&#770;d (high be the hand), compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>. High is the hand which accomplishes mighty deeds, which smites and destroys the foe. </body></html>
