The Jewish royal family shall be reckoned with for their pride and vanity; and those that leap on the threshold, invading their neighbours' rights, and seizing their possessions. The trading people and the rich merchants are called to account. Secure and careless people are reckoned with. They are secure and easy; they say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil; that is, they deny his dispensing rewards and punishments. But in the day of the Lord's judgment, it will clearly appear that those who perish, fall a sacrifice to Divine justice for breaking God's law, and because they have no interest by faith in the Redeemer's atoning sacrifice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will punish all those that leap on the threshold - Neither language nor history nor context allow this to be understood of the idolatrous custom of Ashdod, not to tread on the threshold  of the temple of Dagon. It had indeed been a strange infatuation of idolatry, that God's people should adopt an act of superstitious reverence for an idol in the very instance in which its nothingness and the power of the true God had been shown. Nothing is indeed too brutish for one who chooses an idol for the true God, preferring Satan to the good God. Yet, the superstition belonged apparently to Ashdod alone; the worship of Dagon, although another form of untrue worship, does not appear, like that of Baal, to have fascinated the Jews; nor would Zephaniah, to express a rare superstition, have chosen an idiom, which might more readily express the contrary, that they "leapt "on" the threshold," not over it.<p>They are also the same persons, who "leap on the threshold," and who "fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit." Yet, this relates, not to superstition, but to plunder and goods unjustly gotten. As then, before, he had declared God's judgments upon idolatry, so does he here upon sins against the second table, whether by open violence, or secret fraud, as do also Habakkuk Hab 1:2-3, and Jeremiah Jer 5:27. All, whether open or hidden from man, every wrongful dealing, (for every sin as to a neighbor's goods falls under these two, violence or fraud) shall be avenged in that day. Here again all which remains is the sin. They enriched, as they thought, their masters by art or by force; they schemed, plotted, robbed; they succeeded to their heart's wish; but, "ill-gotten, ill-spent!" They "filled their masters' houses" quite full; but wherewith? with violence and deceit, which witnessed against them, and brought down the judgments of God upon them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. those that leap on the threshold&#8212;the servants of the princes, who, after having gotten prey (like hounds) for their masters, leap exultingly on their masters' thresholds; or, on the thresholds of the houses which they break into [Calvin]. Jerome explains it of those who walk up the steps into the sanctuary with haughtiness. Rosenmuller translates, "Leap over the threshold"; namely, in imitation of the Philistine custom of not treading on the threshold, which arose from the head and hands of Dragon being broken off on the threshold before the ark (1Sa 5:5). Compare Isa 2:6, "thy people &#8230; are soothsayers like the Philistines." Calvin's view agrees best with the latter clause of the verse.<p>fill &#8230; masters' houses with violence, &c.&#8212;that is, with goods obtained with violence, &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zephaniah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the same day; </span> not to be taken for a single day, but more largely for that time wherein God would visit and punish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That leap on the threshold; </span> insolently, and with rage, break open the doors of such whose goods they seize, upon pretence of forfeitures or fines; a sin that Ezekiel both taxed and threatened, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm" title="Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man?

Not in a ludicrous way, who, by dancing and leaping, made sport for persons, and brought their masters much gain, as the damsel possessed with a spirit of divination did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a> rather, that entered rashly and irreverently into the house of God; or else in an idolatrous way, who, when they went into an idol's temple, did not tread upon the threshold, but leaped over it, as the priests of Dagon, after the fall of that idol on the threshold, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4</a>. So the Targum, <p>"and I will visit all those that walk in the laws (or according to the customs) of the Philistines;'' <p>whose idol Dagon was: but it seems better to interpret it of such, who, seeing houses full of good things, in a rude, bold, insolent manner, thrust themselves, or jumped into them, and took away what they pleased; or when they returned to their masters' houses with their spoil, who set them on, and encouraged them in these practices, leaped over the threshold for joy of what they had got, as Aben Ezra observes; which agrees with what follows: <p>which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit; that is, with goods got by rapine and force, and by fraudulent ways and methods: this is to be understood of the servants of great men, who, to feed the ambition and avarice of their masters, used very oppressive methods with inferior persons to get their substance from them, and gratify their masters. Cocceius interprets these "three" verses of the day of Christ's coming in the flesh being at hand, when the true sacrifice should be offered up, and God would call his people to feed by faith upon it; when all civil power and authority in the sanhedrim and family of David should be removed from the Jews; and all friendship with the nations of the world, signified by likeness of garments; and the priestly dignity, the priests, according to him, being those that leaped over the threshold; that is, of the house of the Lord, the temple, and filled it with the spoil of widows' houses, unsupportable precepts, and false doctrines. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zephaniah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the same day also will I punish all those that <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.</span><p>(e) He means the servants of the rulers who invade other men's houses, and rejoice and leap for joy, when they can get any gain to please their master with.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/zephaniah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">those that leap on the threshold</span>] Rather: <span class="bld">leap</span> (or, spring) <span class="bld">over</span> the threshold.

The connexion here, however, implies that leaping over the threshold is rather an act of violence, suggesting forcible invasion of the house, for the next clause, “that fill their master’s house with violence,” is a further description of those that leap over the threshold.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fill their masters’ houses</span>] More probably: <span class="bld">their master’s house</span>, reference being to the king. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zephaniah/1-8.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel....">Zephaniah 1:8-9</a> seem to have a common subject, the princes and king’s children, that is, the officers of the king and the members of the royal family. Probably persons belonging to the collateral branches of the royal house filled judicial and other offices in the government.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>with <span class="ital">violence and deceit</span>] Or, <span class="ital">wrong and fraud</span>. The words do not mean that wrong and fraud are committed <span class="ital">in</span> the house of the king, but that his house is filled with the proceeds of such things, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/3-14.htm" title="The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for you have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses....">Isaiah 3:14-15</a>. What is alluded to is the perversion of justice practised by the princes and the royal family for purposes of gain. At a later time Ezek. makes a similar complaint against the princes and royal house (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/22-25.htm" title="There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the middle thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the middle thereof....">Ezekiel 22:25-29</a>.

There is no allusion to the circumstance of the priests of Dagon abstaining from treading on the threshold of their temple in consequence of what happened to the idol at Ashdod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-5.htm">1 Samuel 5:5</a>). It is inconceivable that this merely local custom, which demonstrated the impotence of the false god, should have been imported into Judah. where, indeed, the worship of Dagon seems never to have made any way. The following clause explains the meaning which the Latin version intimates, <span class="accented">Omnem qui arroganter ingreditur super limen</span> - all those who, carrying out their masters' wishes, violently invade the houses of others and pillage them of their contents. The expression, "to leap over the threshold," seems to have been a common term for burglary and stealing with violence. <span class="cmt_word">Which fill their masters' houses.</span> These retainers plunder and steal in order that they may increase their masters' treasures. The king (though not Josiah) may be meant, the plural being the plural of majesty, or the idol temples. The LXX., followed by Jerome, renders, "who fill the house of the Lord their God." This is plainly erroneous, as there is no question here about the temple at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Violence and deceit;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fruits of, what they have extorted by, violence and fraud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-27.htm">Jeremiah 5:27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-14.htm">Micah 5:14</a> sums up the objects enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10-13</a>, which are to be exterminated, for the purpose of rounding off the description; the only objects of idolatrous worship mentioned being the 'a&#774;she&#772;rim, and the only materials of war, the cities as means of defence. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, written with scriptio plena, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>, lit., stems of trees or posts standing upright or set up as idols, which were dedicated to the Canaanitish goddess of nature (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>). &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, cities with walls, gates, and bolts. These two rather subordinate objects are mentioned instar omnium, to express the entire abolition of war and idolatry. We must not infer from this, however, that the nation of God will still have images made by human hands and worship them, during the stage of its development described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10-14</a>; but must distinguish between the thought and its formal dress. The gross heathen idolatry, to which Israel was addicted under the Old Testament, is a figure denoting that more refined idolatry which will exist even in the church of Christ so long as sin and unbelief endure. The extermination of every kind of heathen idolatry is simply the Old Testament expression for the purification of the church of the Lord from everything of an idolatrous and ungodly nature. To this there is appended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-15.htm">Micah 5:15</a> a promise that the Lord will take vengeance, and wrath, and fury upon the nations which have not heard or have not observed the words and acts of the Lord, i.e., have not yielded themselves up to conversion. In other words, He will exterminate every ungodly power by a fierce judgment, so that nothing will ever be able to disturb the peace of His people and kingdom again. </body></html>
