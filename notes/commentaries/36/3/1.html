Meaning the city of Jerusalem, and its inhabitants; not as before the Babylonish captivity, but after their return from it, under the second temple, as Abarbinel owns; and even as in the times before and at the coming of Christ, and the preaching of his apostles among them; as the whole series of the prophecy, and the connection of the several parts of it, show; and there are such plain intimations of the conversion of the Gentiles, and of such a happy state of the Jews, in which they shall see evil no more, as can agree with no other times than the times of the Gospel, both the beginning and latter part of them. The character of this city, and its inhabitants, is, that it was "filthy", and polluted with murders, adulteries, oppression, rapine, and other sins: our Lord often calls them a wicked and an adulterous generation; and yet they pretended to great purity of life and manners; and they were pure in their own eyes, though not washed from their filthiness; they took much pains to make clean the outside of the cup, but within were full of impurity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25</a>. In the margin it is, "woe to her that is gluttonous". The word is used for the craw or crop of a fowl, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-16.htm">Leviticus 1:16</a> hence some render it (t) "woe to the craw"; to the city that is all craw, to which Jerusalem is compared for its devouring the wealth and substance of others. The Scribes and Pharisees in Christ's time are said to devour widows' houses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a> and this seems to be the sin with which they were defiled, and here charged with. Some think the word signifies one that is publicly, infamous; either made a public example of, or openly exposed, as sometimes filthy harlots are; or rather one "that has made herself infamous" (u); by her sins and vices: <p>to the oppressing city! that oppressed the poor, the widow, and the fatherless. This may have respect to the inhabitants of Jerusalem stoning the prophets of the Lord sent unto them; to the discouragements they laid the followers of Christ under, by not suffering such to come to hear him that were inclined; threatening to cast them out of their synagogues if they professed him, which passed into a law; and to their killing the Lord of life and glory; and the persecution of his apostles, ministers, and people: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>. Some render it, "to the city a dove" (w); being like a silly dove without heart, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>. R. Azariah (x) thinks Jerusalem is so called because in its works it was like Babylon, which had for its military sign on its standard a dove; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a> but the former sense is best. <p>(t)  "vae ingluviei", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

The oppressing city, that acts unjustly and cruelly to the weak and poor. So the three sins for which she is here denounced are that she is rebellious against God, defiled with sin in herself, and cruel to others. The Septuagiut and Vulgate translate <span class="accented">jonah</span> ("oppressing") "dove," which seems singularly inappropriate here, though some try to explain it as applied to Jerusalem in the sense of "silly" or "stupid" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"This confession of sin is followed by a confession of faith on the part of the humiliated people of God" (Shlier.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-7.htm">Micah 7:7</a>. "But I, for Jehovah will I look out; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a>. Rejoice not over me, O mine enemy! for am I fallen, I rise again; for do I sit in darkness, Jehovah is light to me." By &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; what follows is attached adversatively to the preceding words. Even though all love and faithfulness should have vanished from among men, and the day of visitation should have come, the church of the faithful would not be driven from her confidence in the Lord, but would look to Him and His help, and console itself with the assurance that its God would hear it, i.e., rescue it from destruction. As the looking out (tsa&#770;pha&#770;h) for the Lord, whether He would not come, i.e., interpose to judge and aid, involves in itself a prayer for help, though it is not exhausted by it, but also embraces patient waiting, or the manifestation of faith in the life; so the hearing of God is a practical hearing, in other words, a coming to help and to save. The God of my salvation, i.e., from whom all my salvation comes (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>). Her enemy, i.e., the heathen power of the world, represented in Micah's time by Asshur, and personified in thought as daughter Asshur, is not to rejoice over Zion. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for, not "if:" the verb na&#770;phalt&#305;&#772; is rather to be taken conditionally, "for have I fallen;" na&#770;phal being used, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-2.htm">Amos 5:2</a>, to denote the destruction of the power and of the kingdom. The church is here supposed to be praying out of the midst of the period when the judgment has fallen upon it for its sins, and the power of the world is triumphing over it. The prophet could let her speak thus, because he had already predicted the destruction of the kingdom and the carrying away of the people into exile as a judgment that was inevitable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>). Sitting in darkness, i.e., being in distress and poverty (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>). In this darkness the Lord is light to the faithful, i.e., He is their salvation, as He who does indeed chasten His own people, but who even in wrath does not violate His grace, or break the promises which He has given to His people. </body></html>
