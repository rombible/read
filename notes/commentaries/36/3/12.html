These were a type and figure of God’s spiritual remnant, who, at the coming of the Messiah, should believe on him, and embrace his gospel; who were both <span class="ital">poor in spirit, </span>and generally poor as to this world, and were <span class="ital">meek </span>and <span class="ital">lowly in heart, </span>and very different in their dispositions from the proud, self-righteous Pharisees, who rejected Christ on account of his appearing among them in a state of poverty, reproach, and humiliation. <span class="ital">And they shall trust in the name of the Lord — </span>Not in their descent from Abraham, their rite of circumcision, their city or temple, or any of their civil or religious advantages, but only in the Lord, in his mercy, power, and faithfulness. <span class="ital">The remnant of Israel — </span>Preserved in the captivity and dispersion, purified in the furnace of affliction, and now restored to their own land; <span class="ital">shall not do iniquity </span>— Shall not commit the sins they formerly committed, nor provoke God with their idolatries and other abominations as before; they shall be reformed and righteous. <span class="ital">Nor speak lies — </span>Nor shall they deceive each other, as they had been wont to do: they shall be honest and upright, men of veracity and fidelity. <span class="ital">Neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth — </span>Their spirit being without guile, their speech shall be without deceit. <span class="ital">For they shall feed — </span>Or, <span class="ital">They shall also feed, and lie down — </span>That is, they shall abound in necessary things, and live securely; a blessing which shall be added as a crown of their piety and truth. <span class="ital">And none shall make them afraid — </span>So as to induce them to commit iniquity, or speak lies: or, they shall be in no fear of any of the neighbouring nations, but shall have perfect peace on all sides. But this promise undoubtedly was to receive its full accomplishment only in the holy and happy state of the Christian Church, fed and protected by the good Shepherd, and safe under his watchful care; especially in the latter days, and during his millennial reign.

The purifying doctrines of the gospel, or the pure language of the grace of the Lord, would teach men to use the language of humility, repentance, and faith. Purity and piety in common conversation is good. The pure and happy state of the church in the latter days seems intended. The Lord will shut out boasting, and leave men nothing to glory in, save the Lord Jesus, as made of God to them wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Humiliation for sin, and obligations to the Redeemer, will make true believers upright and sincere, whatever may be the case among mere professors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will also leave - (Over, as a remnant, it is still the same heavy prophecy, that a remnant only 'shall be saved')  "an afflicted and poor people." priests, (except that 'great company who were obedient to the faith') <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>, scribes, lawyers, Pharisees, Sadducees were taken away; and there remained "the people of the land" , the "unlearned and ignorant" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>, "the weak things of the world and the things despised" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-28</a> who bore the very title of their Master, "the poor and needy; poor in Spirit" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-1.htm">Psalm 41:1</a>; poor also in outward things, since "they who had lands, sold them and they had all things common" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-35.htm">Acts 4:35</a>.

Of a character just the reverse of the proud and haughty, that should be removed from Jerusalem and Judea by death or captivity; these are they that should be preserved from the general calamity, as the Christians were, and were left in the church of God: these were an "afflicted" people, as the Lord's people in all ages are afflicted with a body of sin; with the temptations of Satan; with the hidings of God's face; with bodily infirmities, and with the reproaches and persecutions of men; the first Christians, both among Jews and Gentiles, justly bore this character, especially with respect to the last article: and they were also "poor", for the most part the poor of this world, being stripped of their worldly enjoyments for the sake of Christ; but especially poor in spirit, broken hearted, contrite, lowly ones; that had a mean opinion of themselves, modest, meek, and humble; sensible of their spiritual poverty, and seeking after the true riches of grace and glory. The Targum renders it, <p>"a meek people, and receiving injuries;'' <p>quietly and patiently: <p>and they shall trust in the name of the Lord; not in men, but in the Lord; not in descent from men, from the patriarchs, as the Jews were wont to do; not in Moses, as they, in his law, and obedience to it; not in any creature or creature enjoyment; not in wealth and riches: nor in their own hearts, or in their own righteousness; but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; in his person for acceptance with God; in his righteousness for justification; in his blood for pardon and cleansing; in his sacrifice for atonement; in his fulness for supplies of grace; in his power and strength for protection and preservation; and in his obedience, sufferings, and death, for salvation and eternal life. This trust signifies, according to the sense of the word (n), a betaking of themselves to Christ as a refuge; a hiding themselves under the shadow of his wings; under his person, blood, and righteousness, where they are covered and sheltered from the avenging justice of God; from the curses of the law, and wrath to come: it is a committing themselves into the hands of Christ; a leaning and staying upon him, expecting grace and glory from him; trusting him with all they have, and for all they want in time and eternity: and this the chosen, redeemed, and called ones, "shall do"; for, through the efficacious grace of God, faith is given to them, and wrought in them; and this is drawn forth into act and exercise by the same grace, and is continued in them, and shall never fail, through the powerful intercession of Christ for them; they shall believe, and go on believing, to the saving of their souls. <p>(n) "se recipient", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Drusius, Burkius; "confugient", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zephaniah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/zephaniah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">I will also leave</span>] As R.V., <span class="bld">But I will leave</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">an afflicted and poor people</span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-32.htm" title="What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation?

He retaineth not His anger for ever, for He delighteth in mercy. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a>. He will have compassion upon us again, tread down our transgressions; and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-20.htm">Micah 7:20</a>. Mayest Thou show truth to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, which Thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old." &#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; looks back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; but whether Micah also plays upon his own name is doubtful. Like the first redemption of Israel out of Egypt, the second or still more glorious redemption of the people of God furnishes an occasion for praising the incomparable nature of the Lord. But whereas in the former Jehovah merely revealed Himself in His incomparable exaltation above all gods, in the restoration of the nation which had been cast out among the heathen because of its sins, and its exaltation among the nations, He now reveals His incomparable nature in grace and compassion. The words &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; are formed after <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where the Lord, after the falling away of Israel from Him by the worship of the golden calf, reveals Himself to Moses as a gracious and merciful God, who forgives guilt and sin. But this grace and compassion are only fully revealed in the restoration and blessing of the remnant of His nation by Jesus Christ. (For <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9</a>.) As One who delighteth in mercy, He will have compassion upon Israel again (ya&#770;shu&#772;bh used adverbially, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/14-8.htm">Hosea 14:8</a>, etc.), will tread down its sins, i.e., conquer their power and tyranny by His compassion, and cast them into the depths of the sea, as He once conquered the tyrant Pharaoh and drowned him in the depths of the sea (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-5.htm">Exodus 15:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>). This believing assurance then closes with the prayer (titte&#772;n is optative) that the Lord will give His rescued nation truth and mercy ('e&#774;meth and chesed, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a>), i.e., give them to enjoy, or bestow upon them, what He had sworn to the patriarchs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>). Abraham and Jacob are mentioned instead of their family (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>).<p>With this lofty praise of the Lord, Micah closes not only the last words, but his whole book. The New Testament parallel, as Hengstenberg has correctly observed, is <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>; and the &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; made known by the apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>. gives us a view of the object and end of the ways of the Lord with His people. </body></html>
