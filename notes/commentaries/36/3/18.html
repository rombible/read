So the Christian Church was, when it was made to flourish in the world, for there is that truth and grace, that piety and virtue in it, which may justly recommend it to the value and esteem of all the people of the earth; and so the universal <span class="ital">church of the firstborn </span>will be in the great day, when the saints shall be brought together to Christ, that he may be admired and glorified in them, and they admired and glorified in and through him, before angels and men. Then will God’s Israel be a name and a praise to all eternity. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:14-20 After the promises of taking away sin, follow promises of taking away trouble. When the cause is removed, the effect will cease. What makes a people holy, will make them happy. The precious promises made to the purified people, were to have full accomplishment in the gospel. These verses appear chiefly to relate to the future conversion and restoration of Israel, and the glorious times which are to follow. They show the abundant peace, comfort, and prosperity of the church, in the happy times yet to come. He will save; he will be Jesus; he will answer the name, for he will save his people from their sins. Before the glorious times foretold, believers would be sorrowful, and objects of reproach. But the Lord will save the weakest believer, and cause true Christians to be greatly honoured where they had been treated with contempt. One act of mercy and grace shall serve, both to gather Israel out of their dispersions and to lead them to their own land. Then will God's Israel be made a name and a praise to eternity. The events alone can fully answer the language of this prophecy. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but they may rejoice in God's love. Surely our hearts should honour the Lord, and rejoice in him, when we hear such words of condescension and grace. If now kept from his ordinances, it is our trial and grief; but in due time we shall be gathered into his temple above. The glory and happiness of the believer will be perfect, unchangeable, and eternal, when he is freed from earthly sorrows, and brought to heavenly bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will gather them that are sorrowful - for the solemn assembly, in which they were to "rejoice" <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-12.htm">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a> before God and which in their captivity God made to cease.

Who are grieved and troubled, because they cannot meet at the time and place of religious worship, or attend the word and ordinances of the Lord; either through distance of place, or infirmity of body; or through the menaces and persecutions of men: and to be prevented the use of the means of grace, upon any account, is a great concern of mind to truly gracious souls: or who are filled with grief and sorrow "for the appointed time" (u); for the time of the Jews' deliverance from their present exile, and return to their own land, which seems to be delayed, and thought long; and so it may seem to some of them in distant parts, after they are converted; and for whose encouragement this is said, that the Lord will in his own due time and way gather such out of all places where they are, into his church, and among his people, to join with them in religious worship, and partake of all the ordinances and privileges of his house; and also gather them into their own land, and comfortably settle them there: <p>who are of thee; belong to the church of Christ; or however have a right to, and meetness for, a place in it; are her true and genuine children, being born again; and which appears by the taste they have for, and their desire after, the word and ordinances: <p>to whom the reproach of it was a burden; it being grievous and burdensome to them to hear the enemy reproach them with their exile and dispersion; with their distance from the place of worship, and their want of opportunity of attending to it: this was intolerable, a burden too heavy for them; it was like a sword in their bones, when they were asked, where is your God? and where are the ordinances of divine worship? and when will it ever be that you will attend them? see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>. <p>(u) "propter tempus, sub. diuturnum exsilii", Vatablus; "ex tempore statuto judiciorum poenarumque", Burkius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zephaniah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will gather <i>them that are</i> sorrowful for the solemn assembly, <i>who</i> are of thee, <i>to whom</i> the reproach of <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> it <i>was</i> a burden.</span><p>(o) That is, those that were held in hatred and reviled for the Church, and because of their religion.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/zephaniah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>.

Before His fury who may stand? and who rise up at the burning of His wrath? His burning heat poureth itself out like fire, and the rocks are rent in pieces by Him." In the rebuking of the sea there is an allusion to the drying up of the Red Sea for the Israelites to pass through (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>); but it is generalized here, and extended to every sea and river, which the Almighty can smite in His wrath, and cause to dry up. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, the vowelless &#1497; of the third pers. being fused into one with the first radical sound, as in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-53.htm">Lamentations 3:53</a> (cf. Ges. 69, Anm. 6, and Ewald 232-3). Bashan, Carmel, and Lebanon are mentioned as very fruitful districts, abounding in a vigorous growth of vegetation and large forests, the productions of which God could suddenly cause to fade and wither in His wrath. Yea more: the mountains tremble and the hills melt away (compare the similar description in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>, and the explanation given there). The earth lifts itself, i.e., starts up from its place (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>), with everything that dwells upon the surface of the globe. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, used intransitively, "to rise," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>; not conclamat s. tollit vocem (J.

No one can stand before such divine wrath, which pours out like consuming fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>), and rends rocks in pieces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>). </body></html>
