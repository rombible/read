The purifying doctrines of the gospel, or the pure language of the grace of the Lord, would teach men to use the language of humility, repentance, and faith. Purity and piety in common conversation is good. The pure and happy state of the church in the latter days seems intended. The Lord will shut out boasting, and leave men nothing to glory in, save the Lord Jesus, as made of God to them wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Humiliation for sin, and obligations to the Redeemer, will make true believers upright and sincere, whatever may be the case among mere professors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The remnant of Israel - The same poor people, the "true Israel" of whom God said, "I leave over" (the word is the same) "a poor people," few, compared with the rest who were blinded; of whom the Lord said, "I know whom I have chosen" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>. These "shall not do iniquity nor speak lies." Cyril: "This is a spiritual adorning, a most beautiful coronet of glorious virtues. For where meekness and humility are and the desire of righteousness, and the tongue unlearns vain words and sinful speech, and is the instrument of strict truth, there dawns a bright and most perfect virtue. And this beseems those who are in Christ. For the beauty of piety is not seen in the Law, but gleams forth in the power of Evangelic teachings."<p>Our Lord said of Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a>, and to the Apostles, "I send you forth as sheep among wolves; be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>; and of the first Christians it is said, "they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house did eat their merit with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46-47</a>. This is the character of Christians, as such, and it was at first fulfilled; "whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>; "whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18</a>. An Apologist, at the close of the second century, could appeal to the Roman Emperor , that no Christian was found among their criminals, "unless it be only as a Christian, or, if he be anything else, he is immediately no longer a Christian. We alone then are innocent! What wonder if this be so, of necessity? And truly of necessity it is so. Taught innocence by God, we both know it perfectly, as being revealed by a perfect Master; and we keep it faithfully, as being committed to us by an Observer, Who may not be despised." : "Being so vast a multitude of men, almost the greater portion of every state, we live silently and modestly, known perhaps more as individuals than as a body, and to be known by no other sign than the reformation of our former sins."<p>Now in the Church, which "our earth dimm'd eyes behold," we can but say, as in regard to the cessation of war  under the Gospel, that God's promises are sure on His part, that still  "they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts," that the Gospel is "a power of God unto salvation" <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, that "the preaching of the Cross is, unto us which are saved, the power of God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>; "unto them that are called, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>; that those who will, "are kept by God through faith unto salvation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>; but that now too "they are not all Israel, which are of Israel" <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a>, and that "the faithlessness of man does not make the faith of God of none effect" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-3.htm">Romans 3:3</a>. : "The Church of God is universally holy in respect of all, by institutions and administrations of sanctity; the same Church is really holy in this world, in relation to all godly persons contained in it, by a real infused sanctity; the same is farther yet at the same time perfectly holy in reference to the saints departed and admitted to the presence of God; and the same Church shall hereafter be most completely holy in the world to come, when all the members, actually belonging to it, shall be at once perfected in holiness and completed in happiness."<p>Most fully shall this be fulfilled in the Resurrection. Rup.: "O blessed day of the Resurrection, in whose fullness no one will sin in word or deed! O great and blessed reward to every soul, which, although it hath now "done iniquity" and "spoken falsehood," yet willeth not to do it further! Great and blessed reward, that he shall now receive such. immovableness, as no longer to be able to do iniquity or speak falsehood, since the blessed soul, through the Spirit of everlasting love inseparably united with God its Creator, shall now no more be capable of an evil will!"<p>For they shall feed - On the hidden manna, Dionysius: "nourished most delicately by the Holy Spirit with inward delights, and spiritual food, the bread of life." In the things of the body too was "distribution made unto every man according as he had need" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-35.htm">Acts 4:35</a>. "And they shall lie down" in the green pastures where He foldeth them; "and none shall make them afraid" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>, "for they were ready to suffer and to die for the Name of the Lord Jesus" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-13.htm">Acts 21:13</a>. "They departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His Name" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>. Before the Resurrection and the sending of the Holy Spirit, how great was the fearfulness, unsteadfastness, weakness of the disciples; how great, after the infusion of the Holy Spirit, was their constancy and imperturbableness, it is delightsome to estimate in their Acts," when they "bare His Name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, and he who had been afraid of a little maid, said to the high priest, "We ought to obey God rather than men" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>. Cyril: "When Christ the Good Shepherd Who laid down His life for His sheep, shone upon us, we are fed in gardens and pastured among lilies, and lie down in folds; for we are folded in Churches and holy shrines, no one scaring or spoiling us, no wolf assailing nor lion trampling on us, no robber breaking through, no one invading us, to steal and kill and destroy; but we abide in safety and participation of every good, being in charge of Christ the Saviour of all." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. nor speak lies&#8212;worshipping God in truth, and towards man having love without dissimulation.

This is the remnant, according to the election of grace, the few the Lord reserved for himself, left in the land, and in his church, for his own glory; who, being truly convinced of sin, and brought to believe in Christ, should leave and forsake their former course of sinning; not that they should be without sin, or none be committed by them; but should not live in it, and be workers of it; make a trade of sinning, and continue therein; or should not commit the sin against the Holy Ghost, as great numbers of the Jews did, in rejecting Jesus as the Messiah, against clear evidence, and the light of their own consciences: <p>nor speak lies; in common talk and conversation; which a child of God, a true believer in Christ, a real Christian, should not and dare not do, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-8.htm">Isaiah 63:8</a> or doctrinal lies, lies in hypocrisy; such doctrines as are not of the truth of the Gospel, but contrary to it; such as the doctrine of justification by works; atonement by ceremonial sacrifices; acceptance with God, through the merits of their fathers; and keeping the traditions of the elders; and other Jewish lies and fables of the same stamp; but rejected by those who have embraced the truth, as it is in Jesus: <p>neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; having clean hearts created and right spirits renewed in them; being Israelites indeed, in whom there is no guile, and true followers of Jesus, in whom nothing of this kind could be found: <p>for they shall feed, like a flock of sheep, to which they may be compared for their innocence and harmlessness, meekness and patience; feed in the fat pastures of the word and ordinances of Christ, under the care and guidance of him the good Shepherd; and so go in and out, and find pasture, food, and fulness of it, in him, his flesh, and blood; in his precious truths, and Gospel provisions made in his house: <p>and lie down; in green pastures of ordinances, beside the still waters of everlasting love and divine grace, and in the good fold of the church; all which is a reason why they do not and cannot sin as others do; nor tell lies, and be guilty of deceit and falsehood; for they are better taught; and the grace of God, in giving them spiritual food and rest, influences and engages them to such a conduct and behaviour: or, "therefore they shall feed" (o), &amp;c. being truly gracious and sincere souls, who cannot indulge themselves in sin, nor act a false and deceitful part: <p>and none shall make them afraid; of feeding in those pastures, and lying down in those folds; or shall deter them from an attendance on the word and ordinances; or joining in fellowship with the churches of Christ therein; neither Satan, the roaring lion, nor false teachers, and persecuting tyrants, those grievous wolves, and cruel bears; or so frighten them, that in their fright they shall tell lies, and use deceit. <p>(o) "ideo", Grotius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zephaniah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/zephaniah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">The remnant of Israel</span>] After the great judgment of the day of the Lord, only a remnant shall be left (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:...">Joel 2:28-32</a>).

He will have compassion upon us again, tread down our transgressions; and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-20.htm">Micah 7:20</a>. Mayest Thou show truth to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, which Thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old." &#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; looks back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; but whether Micah also plays upon his own name is doubtful. Like the first redemption of Israel out of Egypt, the second or still more glorious redemption of the people of God furnishes an occasion for praising the incomparable nature of the Lord. But whereas in the former Jehovah merely revealed Himself in His incomparable exaltation above all gods, in the restoration of the nation which had been cast out among the heathen because of its sins, and its exaltation among the nations, He now reveals His incomparable nature in grace and compassion. The words &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; are formed after <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where the Lord, after the falling away of Israel from Him by the worship of the golden calf, reveals Himself to Moses as a gracious and merciful God, who forgives guilt and sin. But this grace and compassion are only fully revealed in the restoration and blessing of the remnant of His nation by Jesus Christ. (For <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9</a>.) As One who delighteth in mercy, He will have compassion upon Israel again (ya&#770;shu&#772;bh used adverbially, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/14-8.htm">Hosea 14:8</a>, etc.), will tread down its sins, i.e., conquer their power and tyranny by His compassion, and cast them into the depths of the sea, as He once conquered the tyrant Pharaoh and drowned him in the depths of the sea (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-5.htm">Exodus 15:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>). This believing assurance then closes with the prayer (titte&#772;n is optative) that the Lord will give His rescued nation truth and mercy ('e&#774;meth and chesed, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a>), i.e., give them to enjoy, or bestow upon them, what He had sworn to the patriarchs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>). Abraham and Jacob are mentioned instead of their family (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>).<p>With this lofty praise of the Lord, Micah closes not only the last words, but his whole book. The New Testament parallel, as Hengstenberg has correctly observed, is <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>; and the &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; made known by the apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>. gives us a view of the object and end of the ways of the Lord with His people. </body></html>
