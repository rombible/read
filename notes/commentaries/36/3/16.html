When the cause is removed, the effect will cease. What makes a people holy, will make them happy. The precious promises made to the purified people, were to have full accomplishment in the gospel. These verses appear chiefly to relate to the future conversion and restoration of Israel, and the glorious times which are to follow. They show the abundant peace, comfort, and prosperity of the church, in the happy times yet to come. He will save; he will be Jesus; he will answer the name, for he will save his people from their sins. Before the glorious times foretold, believers would be sorrowful, and objects of reproach. But the Lord will save the weakest believer, and cause true Christians to be greatly honoured where they had been treated with contempt. One act of mercy and grace shall serve, both to gather Israel out of their dispersions and to lead them to their own land. Then will God's Israel be made a name and a praise to eternity. The events alone can fully answer the language of this prophecy. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but they may rejoice in God's love. Surely our hearts should honour the Lord, and rejoice in him, when we hear such words of condescension and grace. If now kept from his ordinances, it is our trial and grief; but in due time we shall be gathered into his temple above. The glory and happiness of the believer will be perfect, unchangeable, and eternal, when he is freed from earthly sorrows, and brought to heavenly bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not - For "perfect love casteth out fear" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-18.htm">John 4:18</a>; from where he saith, "Fear not, little flock; it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>.

"A God jealous and taking vengeance is Jehovah; an avenger is Jehovah, and Lord of wrathful fury; an avenger is Jehovah to His adversaries, and He is One keeping wrath to His enemies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>. Jehovah is long-suffering and of great strength, and He does not acquit of guilt. Jehovah, His way is in the storm and in the tempest, and clouds are the dust of His feet." The prophecy commences with the words with which God expresses the energetic character of His holiness in the decalogue (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-19.htm">Joshua 24:19</a>), where we find the form &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; for &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;. Jehovah is a jealous God, who turns the burning zeal of His wrath against them that hate Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>). His side of the energy of the divine zeal predominates here, as the following predicate, the three-times repeated &#1504;&#1511;&#1501;, clearly shows. The strengthening of the idea of no&#772;qe&#772;m involved in the repetition of it three times (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>), is increased still further by the apposition ba'al che&#772;ma&#770;h, possessor of the wrathful heat, equivalent to the wrathful God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-22.htm">Proverbs 29:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-24.htm">Proverbs 22:24</a>). The vengeance applies to His adversaries, towards whom He bears ill-will. Na&#770;tar, when predicated of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9</a>, signifies to keep or bear wrath. God does not indeed punish immediately; He is long-suffering (&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>, etc.). His long-suffering is not weak indulgence, however, but an emanation from His love and mercy; for He is gedo&#772;l-ko&#772;a&#774;ch, great in strength (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-17.htm">Numbers 14:17</a>), and does not leave unpunished (&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; after <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). His great might to punish sinners, He has preserved from of old; His way is in the storm and tempest. With these words Nahum passes over to a description of the manifestations of divine wrath upon sinners in great national judgments which shake the world (&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>  equals  &#1505;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, which is connected with &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-16.htm">Psalm 83:16</a>). These and similar descriptions are founded upon the revelations of God, when bringing Israel out of Egypt, and at the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai, when the Lord came down upon the mountain in clouds, fire, and vapour of smoke (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>). Clouds are the dust of His feet. The Lord comes down from heaven in the clouds. As man goes upon the dust, so Jehovah goes upon the clouds. </body></html>
