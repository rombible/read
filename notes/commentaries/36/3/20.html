When the cause is removed, the effect will cease. What makes a people holy, will make them happy. The precious promises made to the purified people, were to have full accomplishment in the gospel. These verses appear chiefly to relate to the future conversion and restoration of Israel, and the glorious times which are to follow. They show the abundant peace, comfort, and prosperity of the church, in the happy times yet to come. He will save; he will be Jesus; he will answer the name, for he will save his people from their sins. Before the glorious times foretold, believers would be sorrowful, and objects of reproach. But the Lord will save the weakest believer, and cause true Christians to be greatly honoured where they had been treated with contempt. One act of mercy and grace shall serve, both to gather Israel out of their dispersions and to lead them to their own land. Then will God's Israel be made a name and a praise to eternity. The events alone can fully answer the language of this prophecy. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but they may rejoice in God's love. Surely our hearts should honour the Lord, and rejoice in him, when we hear such words of condescension and grace. If now kept from his ordinances, it is our trial and grief; but in due time we shall be gathered into his temple above. The glory and happiness of the believer will be perfect, unchangeable, and eternal, when he is freed from earthly sorrows, and brought to heavenly bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At that time will I bring you in - that is, into the one fold, the one Church, the one "Household of God, even in the time that I gather you." "That time" is the whole time of the Gospel; the one "day of salvation," in which all who shall ever be gathered, shall be brought into the new Jerusalem. These words were fulfilled, when, at our Lord's first Coming, the remnant, the true Israel, those "ordained to eternal life" were brought in. It shall be fulfilled again, when "the fullness of the Gentiles shall be "come in," and so all Israel shall be saved" <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25-26</a>. It shall most perfectly be fulfilled at the end, when there shall be no going out of those once "brought" in, and those who have gathered others into the Church, shall be "a name and a praise among all people of the earth," those whom God hath "redeemed out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation" <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, shining like stars forever and ever.<p>When I turn back your captivity - Rup.: "That conversion, then begun, now perfected, when the dead shall rise and they shall be placed on the right hand, soon to receive the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world. O mighty spectacle of the reversed captivity of those once captives; mighty wonder at their present blessedness, as they review the misery of their past captivity!" "Before your eyes," so that we shall see what we now believe and hope for, the end of all our sufferings, chastisements, losses, achings of the heart, the fullness of our Redemption. That which our eyes have looked for, "our eyes shall behold and not another," the everliving God as He is, face to Face; "saith the Lord," Who is the Truth Itself, all Whose words will be fulfilled. "heaven and earth shall pass away, but My Words shall not pass away" <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-31.htm">Mark 13:31</a>, saith He who is "God blessed forever." And so the prophet closes in the thought of Him, Whose Name is I am, the Unchangeable, the everlasting Rest and Center of those who, having been once captives and halting and scattered among the vanities of the world, turn to Him, to whom be glory and thanksgiving forever and ever.

That is, at the time that the Lord will gather them in the effectual calling to himself and to his church, he will return them to their own land; and, as soon as the Jews are converted, they will not only be gathered into Christian churches, but will be gathered together in one body, and appoint themselves one head; and will go up out of each of the lands wherein they have been dispersed, and enter into their own land, and possess it; at the same time they are made partakers of the grace of God, they will enjoy all their civil privileges and liberties; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-11.htm">Hosea 1:11</a>, <p>for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth; this is repeated from the preceding verse <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19</a>, for the confirmation of it; and in connection with the following clause, to show when it will be: <p>when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord; or "captivities" (x); meaning not the several captivities of the kings of Judah in Babylon, as of Manasseh, Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah; but the two fold captivity of this people, literal and spiritual; their present outward exile from their own land, captivity and dispersion among the nations; and their spiritual captivity or bondage, to sin, Satan, the law, and the traditions of their elders; from both which they will be delivered at one and the same time; and which will be notorious and manifest; what their eyes will see with pleasure and admiration; and which may he depended upon will be done, since the Lord has said it, whose purposes, promises, and prophecies, never fail of their accomplishment: he is God omniscient and knows with certainty what will be done; he is God omnipotent, and can and will do whatever he has determined, promised, or said should be done. <p>(x)  "captivitates vestras", Pagninus, Montanus, Calvin, Drusius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zephaniah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/zephaniah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">even in the time that I gather you</span>] The sense is probably as R.V., <span class="bld">and at that time will I gather you</span>, though the language of the original is very anomalous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">among all people of the earth</span>] <span class="bld">all the peoples</span> of the earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">turn back your captivity</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-7.htm" title="And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.">Zephaniah 2:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before your eyes</span>] The deliverance shall not be delayed till their eyes are closed and be seen only by their children.

With this turn Nahum prepares the way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-7.htm">Nahum 1:7</a>. for proclaiming the judgment of wrath upon Nineveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-7.htm">Nahum 1:7</a>. "Good is Jehovah, a refuge in the day of trouble; and He knoweth those who trust in Him. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>. And with an overwhelming flood will He make an end of her place, and pursue His enemies into darkness." Even in the manifestation of His wrath God proves His goodness; for the judgment, by exterminating the wicked, brings deliverance to the righteous who trust in the Lord, out of the affliction prepared for them by the wickedness of the world. The predicate &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; is more precisely defined by the apposition &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, for a refuge  equals  a refuge in time of trouble. The goodness of the Lord is seen in the fact that He is a refuge in distress. The last clause says to whom: viz., to those who trust in Him. They are known by Him. "To know is just the same as not to neglect; or, expressed in a positive form, the care or providence of God in the preservation of the faithful" (Calvin). For the fact, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-9.htm">Psalm 34:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a>. And because the Lord is a refuge to His people, He will put an end to the oppressor of His people, viz., Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian empire, and that with an overwhelming flood. Sheteph, overwhelming, is a figure denoting the judgment sweeping over a land or kingdom, through the invasion of hostile armies (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-26.htm">Daniel 11:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>). &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, overflowed by a river (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, to put an end to anything, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>. &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468; is the accusative of the object: make her place a vanishing one. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, the fem. of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, an adjective in a neuter sense, that which is vanishing away. The suffix in &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468; refers to Nineveh in the heading (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>): either Nineveh personified as a queen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-7.htm">Nahum 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-4.htm">Nahum 3:4</a>), is distinguished from her seat (Hitzig); or what is much more simple, the city itself is meant, and "her place" is to be understood in this sense, that with the destruction of the city even the place where it stood would cease to be the site of a city, with which March aptly compares the phrase, "its place knoweth man no more" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-10.htm">Job 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-18.htm">Job 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-9.htm">Job 20:9</a>). &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; are the inhabitants of Nineveh, or the Assyrians generally, as the enemies of Israel. &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;&#1470;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, not darkness will pursue its enemies; for this view is irreconcilable with the makkeph: but to pursue with darkness, cho&#772;shekh being an accusative either of place or of more precise definition, used in an instrumental sense. The former is the simpler view, and answers better to the parallelism of the clauses. As the city is to vanish and leave no trace behind, so shall its inhabitants perish in darkness. </body></html>
