Not enemies, without, destroy her, but<p>Her princes within her - In the very midst of the flock, whom they should in God's stead "feed with a true heart," destroy her as they will, having no protection against them. "Her judges are evening wolves" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>); these who should in the Name of God redress all grievances and wrongs, are themselves like wild beasts, when most driven by famine. "They gnaw not the bones  until the morrow or on the morrow" (literally, in the morning). They reserve nothing until the morning light, but do in darkness the works of darkness, shrinking from the light, and, in extreme rapacity, devouring at once the whole substance of the poor.

Or, "as roaring lions"; there being a defect of the note of similitude; which is supplied by the Targum, Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions. This is to be understood, not of the princes of the blood; but of civil magistrates in common; the members of the grand sanhedrim; the princes of the Jewish world, that crucified the Lord of glory; and who gaped upon him with their mouths like ravening and roaring lions, as is foretold they should, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a> and who breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of Christ; and by their menaces endeavoured to frighten and deter them from preaching in his name, and from a profession of him; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>, <p>her judges are evening wolves; or, like them, cruel, voracious, never satisfied; especially are very ravenous in the evening, having had no food all day; not daring to go abroad in the daytime to seek their prey; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>. The Septuagint and Arabic versions read "wolves of Arabia"; but wrongly; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a> such rapacious covetous judges were there in Christ's time; who gives us an instance in one, by which we may judge of the rest, who feared not God, nor regarded men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-2.htm">Luke 18:2</a> such as these were hungry and greedy after gifts and bribes to pervert judgment, and to devour the poor, the widow, and the fatherless, on whom they had no mercy: <p>they gnaw not the bones till the morrow; or rather, "in the morning" (z); that is, either they leave not the bones till the morning, as Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it; they are so hungry, that they eat up bones and all at once, and reserve nothing for the next day; which expresses both the greediness of these judges, and the total consumption of the estates of men made by them: or else the sense is, that not having gnawn any bones in the morning, or eaten anything that day, hence they are so greedy in the evening; and so this last clause gives a reason why evening wolves are so voracious; for which such cruel judges are compared to them. <p>(z) "in mane", Pagninus, Montanus, Drusius; "matutino", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zephaniah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Her princes within her <i>are</i> roaring lions; her judges <i>are</i> evening wolves; they <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> gnaw not the bones till the morrow.</span><p>(b) They are so greedy, that they eat up bones and all.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/zephaniah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. Every class does evil, each in its own way. A very full parallel is <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/22-25.htm" title="There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the middle thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the middle thereof....">Ezekiel 22:25-28</a> (in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-25.htm" title="There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the middle thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 22:25</a></span> read <span class="ital">princes</span>). The “princes” may be the royal house, or the magnates in whose hands lay the judicial and governing power. Ezek. describing the princes says, they are “like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure; they have made her widows many.” The “judges” are compared to evening wolves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm" title="Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.">Habakkuk 1:8</a>), less powerful than the lions but no less insatiable and murderous. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-27.htm" title="Her princes in the middle thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.">Ezekiel 22:27</a>, “wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.” Judicial corruption and murder are often complained of by the prophets; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm" title="Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm" title="The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean on the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come on us.">Micah 3:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-17.htm" title="But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.">Jeremiah 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm" title="In you have they taken gifts to shed blood; you have taken usury and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten me, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 22:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">gnaw not the bones till the morrow</span>] The term rendered “gnaw the bones” occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm" title="God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.">Numbers 24:8</a>, where, however, the word “bones” is expressed; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-34.htm" title="You shall even drink it and suck it out, and you shall break the shards thereof, and pluck off your own breasts: for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 23:34</a>, “thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof.” With this sense the clause might mean, <span class="ital">evening wolves that gnawed not</span> (the) <span class="ital">bones in the morning;</span> the idea being that the wolves having had no prey in the morning were keen from hunger and ferocious in the evening. Others suppose the word to be different from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm" title="God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.">Numbers 24:8</a>, and to be allied to an Aramaic root signifying <span class="ital">to cut off</span> (a part), hence to <span class="ital">reserve</span>, leave over; and render, evening wolves <span class="ital">that leave nothing over till the morning</span>,—their insatiable voracity devouring everything, hide and hair, at once. It must be acknowledged that this sense of <span class="ital">leave over</span> is somewhat conjectural.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Roaring lions.</span> The princes, who ought to protect the people, are ready to tear them in pieces and devour them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>).

This must have been written before the great reformation. <span class="cmt_word">Evening wolves</span> (see note on Habakkuk 1:8). The judges, whose duty it was to administer justice and to set an example of equity and virtue, are themselves most cruel and rapacious. <span class="cmt_word">They gnaw not the bones till tomorrow</span>; <span class="accented">they gnaw no bones in the morning</span>; that is, they are so greedy that they eat up all their prey at once and leave nothing till the morning. The versions drop the metaphor, and render, "They leave not to the morning" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-27.htm">Ezekiel 22:27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The wrath of Jehovah shall I bear, for I have sinned against Him, till He shall fight my fight, and secure my right. He will bring me forth to the light; I shall behold His righteousness. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>. And may my enemy see it, and shame cover her, who hath said to me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes will see it; now will she be for a treading down, like mire of the streets." Confidence in the help of the Lord flows from the consciousness, that the wretchedness and sufferings are a merited punishment for the sins. This consciousness and feeling generate patience and hope: patience to bear the wrath of God manifesting itself in the sufferings; hope that the sufferings, as inflicted by the righteous God, will cease as soon as the divine justice has been satisfied. Za&#8219;aph: lit., the foaming up of wrath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>); hence strong wrath. This the church will bear, till the Lord conducts its conflict and secures its rights. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; is the judicial conflict between Israel and the heathen power of the world. Although, for example, God had given up His nation to the power of its enemies, the nations of the world, on account of its sins, so that they accomplished the will of God, by destroying the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and carrying away the people into exile; yet they grew proud of their own might in so doing, and did not recognise themselves as instruments of punishment in the hand of the Lord, but attributed their victories to the power of their own arm, and even aimed at the destruction of Israel, with scornful defiance of the living God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>). Thus they violated the rights of Israel, so that the Lord was obliged to conduct the contest of His people with the heathen, and secure the rights of Israel by the overthrow of the heathen power of the world. For &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-1.htm">Psalm 43:1</a>; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4-5</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22</a>. Mishpa&#770;t is Israel's right, in opposition to the powers of the world, who would destroy it. The following word &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is not governed by &#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as the absence of the copula Vav shows. With these words the hope takes the form of the certain assurance that the Lord will remove the distress, and let Israel see His righteousness. Tseda&#770;qa&#770;h is the righteousness of God revealing itself in the forgiveness and restoration of Israel to favour; like tseda&#770;qo&#772;th in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-5.htm">Micah 6:5</a> : in actual fact, the salvation of Israel about to be secured, regarded as an emanation of the righteousness of the covenant God; hence parallel to &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; with &#1489;, to look at, so that one penetrates, as it were, into an object, seeing with feasting of the eyes (so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>). This exaltation of Israel to new salvation it is hoped that the enemy will see (&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1488;, opt.), and be covered with shame; for the power of the world is overthrown, in order that Israel may be redeemed out of its power. This desire is a just one, because the enemy has despised the Lord God. For the expression, "Where is Jehovah thy God?" compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>. And Israel will see its fulfilment (&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; with Nun doubled after a sharpened ; see Ewald, 198, a). &#8219;Atta&#770;h, now (seeing the future in spirit, as having already come), the enemy will be trodden down like mire of the streets (for this figure, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>). </body></html>
