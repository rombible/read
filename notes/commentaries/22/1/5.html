The kisses of his mouth mean those assurances of pardon with which believers are favoured, filling them with peace and joy in believing, and causing them to abound in hope by the power of the Holy Ghost. Gracious souls take most pleasure in loving Christ, and being loved of him. Christ's love is more valuable and desirable than the best this world can give. The name of Christ is not now like ointment sealed up, but like ointment poured forth; which denotes the freeness and fulness of the setting forth of his grace by the gospel. Those whom he has redeemed and sanctified, are here the virgins that love Jesus Christ, and follow him whithersoever he goes, Re 14:4. They entreat him to draw them by the quickening influences of his Spirit. The more clearly we discern Christ's glory, the more sensible shall we be that we are unable to follow him suitably, and at the same time be more desirous of doing it. Observe the speedy answer given to this prayer. Those who wait at Wisdom's gate, shall be led into truth and comfort. And being brought into this chamber, our griefs will vanish. We have no joy but in Christ, and for this we are indebted to him. We will remember to give thanks for thy love; it shall make more lasting impressions upon us than any thing in this world. Nor is any love acceptable to Christ but love in sincerity, Eph 6:24. The daughters of Jerusalem may mean professors not yet established in the faith. The spouse was black as the tents of the wandering Arabs, but comely as the magnificent curtains in the palaces of Solomon. The believer is black, as being defiled and sinful by nature, but comely, as renewed by Divine grace to the holy image of God. He is still deformed with remains of sin, but comely as accepted in Christ. He is often base and contemptible in the esteem of men, but excellent in the sight of God. The blackness was owing to the hard usage that had been suffered. The children of the church, her mother, but not of God, her Father, were angry with her. They had made her suffer hardships, which caused her to neglect the care of her soul. Thus, under the emblem of a poor female, made the chosen partner of a prince, we are led to consider the circumstances in which the love of Christ is accustomed to find its objects. They were wretched slaves of sin, in toil, or in sorrow, weary and heavy laden, but how great the change when the love of Christ is manifested to their souls!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This section is made by the Targumist and other Jewish interpreters to adumbrate the condition of Israel in the wilderness; by some Christian expositors, that of the Gentile Church on her first conversion.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-5.htm">Songs 1:5</a><p>I am black ... - Dark-hued, as the tents of Kedar with their black goats' hair coverings, rough and weather-stained, "but comely (beautiful) as the rich hangings which adorn the pavilion of Solomon.

She draws the image from the black goatskins with which the Scenite Arabs ("Kedar" was in Arabia-Petr&aelig;a) cover their tents (contrasted with the splendid state tent in which the King was awaiting His bride according to Eastern custom); typifying the darkness of man's natural state. To feel this, and yet also feel one's self in Jesus Christ "comely as the curtains of Solomon," marks the believer (Ro 7:18, &c.; 8:1); 1Ti 1:15, "I am chief"; so she says not merely, "I was," but "I am"; still black in herself, but comely through His comeliness put upon her (Eze 16:14).<p>curtains&#8212;first, the hangings and veil in the temple of Solomon (Eze 16:10); then, also, the "fine linen which is the righteousness of saints" (Re 19:8), the white wedding garment provided by Jesus Christ (Isa 61:10; Mt 22:11; 1Co 1:30; Col 1:28; 2:10; Re 7:14). Historically, the dark tents of Kedar represent the Gentile Church (Isa 60:3-7, &c.). As the vineyard at the close is transferred from the Jews, who had not kept their own, to the Gentiles, so the Gentiles are introduced at the commencement of the Song; for they were among the earliest enquirers after Jesus Christ (Mt 2:1-12): the wise men from the East (Arabia, or Kedar).<p>daughters of Jerusalem&#8212;professors, not the bride, or "the virgins," yet not enemies; invited to gospel blessings (So 3:10, 11); so near to Jesus Christ as not to be unlikely to find Him (So 5:8); desirous to seek Him with her (So 6:1; compare So 6:13; 7:1, 5, 8). In So 7:8, 9, the bride's Beloved becomes their Beloved; not, however, of all of them (So 8:4; compare Lu 23:27, 28).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/songs/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I am black.</span> It might be objected, Who art thou, that thou shouldst have or pretend to such a royal Bridegroom, and such honours and favours?

The church having obtained of Christ, what she wanted, turns to the daughters of Jerusalem, the same perhaps with the virgins her companions; they seem to be young converts, it may be not yet members of the visible church, but had a great respect for the church, and she for them; and who, though they had but a small knowledge of Christ her beloved, yet were desirous of knowing more of him, and seeking him with her; see Sol 3:9; to these she gives this character of herself, that she was "black" in herself (x), through original sin and actual transgression; in her own eyes, through indwelling sin, and many infirmities, spots, and blemishes in life; and in the eyes of the world, through afflictions, persecutions, and reproaches, she was attended with, and so with them the offscouring of all things: "but comely" in the eyes of Christ, called by him his "fair one", the "fairest among women", and even "all fair", Sol 1:8; through his comeliness put upon her, the imputation of his righteousness to her; through the beauties of holiness upon her; through, the sanctifying influences of his Spirit; and, being in a church state, walking in Gospel order, attending to the commands and ordinances of Christ; and so beautiful as Tirzah, and comely as Jerusalem, Sol 6:4; and upon all accounts "desirable" (y) to Christ, and to his people, as the word may be rendered; <p>as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon: each of which are thought by some to refer to both parts of her character; and suppose that the tents of Kedar, though they might look poor on the outside, were full of wealth and riches within; and Solomon's curtains, or hangings, might have an outward covering not so rich and beautiful as they were on the inside; but rather the blackness of the church is designed by the one, and her comeliness by the other. With respect to her blackness, she compares herself to the tents of Kedar, to the inhabitants of those tents, who were of a black or swarthy complexion; Kedar signifies the name of a man whose posterity these were, that dwelt in tents, even of Kedar the second son of Ishmael, and who inhabited some part of Arabia; and, their employment being to feed cattle, moved from place to place for the sake of pasturage, and so dwelt in tents, which they could easily remove, and hence were called Scenites; and the tents they dwelt in being made of hair cloth, and continually exposed to the sun and rain, were very black, and yet a number of them made a fine appearance, as Dr. Shaw relates (z); though black, yet were beautiful to behold; he says, <p>"the Bedouin Arabs at this day live in tents called "hhymes", from the shelter which they afford the inhabitants; and "beet el shaar", that is, "houses of hair", from the materials or webs of goats' hair whereof they were made; and are such hair cloth as our coal sacks are made of; the colour of them is beautifully alluded to, Sol 1:5; for nothing certainly can afford (says he) a more delightful prospect than a large extensive plain, whether in its verdure, or even scorched up by the sunbeams, than, these movable habitations pitched in circles upon them; of which (he says) he has seen from three to three hundred.'' <p>And for her comeliness the church compares herself either to the curtains of Solomon, about his bed, or to the rich hangings of tapestry in the several apartments of his palace, which no doubt were very costly and magnificent. <p>(x) "Nigra per naturam, formosa per gratiam", Aug. de Tempore, serm. 201. p. 354. tom. 10.

Here the Shulammite, under the inquisitive glances of the court ladies, who probably desire to see whether they have in any degree accomplished their purpose of rousing her admiration for the king, remembers her rustic appearance, and explains that the swarthy colour which is so different from theirs, is not natural or permanent, and asserts her equality in beauty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I am black</span>] Better, <span class="bld">swart</span>.

There is certainly no reason to take the word as an argument for the bride being Pharaoh's daughter; but it points to what is confirmed by the rest of the poem - the rustic birth and northern blood of the bride. She has been living in the fields, and is browned with the ruddy health of a country life. The best explanation of the words is that they are drawn out by the fact that the bride is surrounded by her ladies. Some think that they look askance at her, or with indignation at the boldness of her words; but that is quite unnecessary, and would be inconsistent with the dignity of the bride. The country  maiden feels the greatness of the honour, that she is chosen of the king, and with simple modesty, in the presence of courtly ladies around her, sets forth her claim. The simile is not uncommon in poetry, as in Theocritus and Virgil. <span class="accented">Comely</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> attractive, agreeable. <span class="accented">Kedar</span> (whether from the Arabic, meaning "powerful," or from the Hebrew, "black") designates the tribes of the North Arabian descendants of Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a>), Kedareens, referred to by Pliny, and remaining in Arabia until the time of the Mohammedans. The Bedouin still calls his tent his "hair house;" it is covered with goat's-hair cloth, mostly black or grey. Whether the reference is to the colour of the goat's hair or to the tents being browned or blackened by the heat of the sun, we cannot doubt that the allusion is to the complexion, and the rest of the simile would then be applicable to the lovely shape and features of the maiden, the curtains of Solomon being the curtains of a pavilion, or pleasure tent, spread out like "a shining butterfly," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beautiful cloth or tapestry which formed the sides of the tent or the tent coverings, the clothing of the framework, or tent hangings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1</a>, etc.). Egyptian hangings were particularly prized. The custom prevailed among Eastern monarchs of sojourning once in the year in some lovely rural district, and at such times their tents would be very magnificent. The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, "as the skins of Solomon;" but this is a mistake. The word is derived from a root "to tremble," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to glitter in the sun." Those who desire to find an allegorical interpretation think there is an evident allusion here to the sojourn of Israel in the wilderness, or the admission of the Gentiles into the covenant; but there is no reason for any such strain upon the meaning. The simile is merely poetical. The soul realizes its own acceptance before God, but ascribes that acceptance to his grace. "The bride, the Lamb's wife," sees the beauty of the Lord reflected in herself, and rejoices in her own attractions for his sake. There is no immodesty in the consciousness of merit so long as that merit is ascribed to him from whom it comes. There is often more pride in the assumption of humility than in the claim to be acknowledged. The same apostle who declared himself less than the least of all saints also maintained that he was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The final result, after all is learned, (is this): Fear God and keep His commandments; for this is the end of every man." Many expositors, as Jerome, the Venet., and Luther, render &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; as fut.: The conclusion of the discourse we would all hear (Salomon); or: The conclusion of the whole discourse or matter let us hear (Panzer, 1773, de Wette-Augusti); Hitzig also takes together soph davar hakol  equals  soph davar kol-haddavar: The end of the whole discourse let us hear. But &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is contrary to the style of the book; and as a general rule, the author uses &#1492;&#1499;&#1500; for the most part of things, seldom of persons. And also soph davar hakol, which it would be better to explain ("the final word of the whole"), with Ewald, 291a, after yeme&#772;-olam mosheh, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>, than it is explained by Hitzig, although, in spite of Philippi's (Sta. const. p. 17) doubt, possible in point of style, and also exemplified in the later period of the language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-13.htm">1 Chronicles 9:13</a>), is yet a stylistic crudeness which the author could have avoided either by writing soph devar hakol, or better, soph kol-haddavar. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, Ewald, 168b, renders as a particip. by audiendum; but that also does not commend itself, for &#1504;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506; signifies nothing else than auditum, and acquires the meaning of audiendum when from the empirical matter of fact that which is inwardly necessary is concluded; the translation: The final word of the whole is to be heard, audiendum est, would only be admissible of also the translation auditum est were possible, which is not the case. Is &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; thus possibly the pausal form of the finite &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;? We might explain: The end of the matter (summa summarum), all is heard, when, viz., that which follows is heard, which comprehends all that is to be known. Or as Hoelem.: Enough, all is heard, since, viz., that which is given in the book to be learned contains the essence of all true knowledge, viz., the following two fundamental doctrines. This retrospective reference of hakol nishm'a is more natural than the prospective reference; but, on the other hand, it is also more probable that soph davar denotes the final resultat than that it denotes the conclusion of the discourse. The right explanation will be that which combines the retrospective reference of nakol nishm'a and the resultative reference of soph davar. Accordingly, Mendelss. appears to us to be correct when he explains: After thou hast heard all the words of the wise ... this is the final result, etc. Finis (summa) rei&#770; omnia audita is  equals  omnibus auditis, for the sentence denoting the conditions remains externally undesignated, in the same way as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-1.htm">Deuteronomy 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a> (Ewald, 341b). After the clause, soph ... nishm'a, Athnach stands where we put a colon: the mediating hocce est is omitted just as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a> (where translate: yet the preference of knowledge is this, that, etc.).<p>The sentence, eth-naeolohim yera ("fear God"), repeating itself from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>, is the kernel and the star of the whole book, the highest moral demand which mitigates its pessimism and hallows its eudaemonism. The admonition proceeding therefrom, "and keep His commandments," is included in lishmo'a, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:1</a>, which places the hearing of the divine word, viz., a hearing for the purpose of observing, as the very soul of the worship of God above all the opus operatum of ceremonial services.<p>The connection of the clause, ki-zeh kol-haadam, Hitzig mediates in an unnecessary, roundabout way: "but not thou alone, but this ought every man." But why this negative here introduced to stamp &#1499;&#1497; as an immo establishing it? It is also certainly suitable as the immediate confirmation of the rectitude of the double admonition finally expressing all. The clause has the form of a simple judgment, it is a substantival clause, the briefest expression for the thought which is intended. What is that thought? The lxx renders: &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; also Symm. and the Venet. render kol haadam by &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;., and an unnamed translator has &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;., according to which also the translation of Jerome is to be understood, hoc est enim omnis homo. Thus among the moderns, Herzf., Ewald, Elst., and Heiligst.: for that is the whole man, viz., as to his destiny, the end of his existence (cf. as to the subject-matter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>); and v. Hofmann (Schriftbew. II 2, p. 456): this is the whole of man, viz., as Grotius explains: totum hominis bonum; or as Dale and Bullock: "the whole duty of man;" or as Tyler: "the universal law (&#1499;&#1500;, like the Mishnic &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;) of man;" or as Hoelem.: that which gives to man for the first time his true and full worth. Knobel also suggests for consideration this rendering: this is the all of man, i.e., on this all with man rests. But against this there is the one fact, that kol-haadam never signifies the whole man, and as little anywhere the whole (the all) of a man. It signifies either "all men" (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;), as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a>, hu soph kol-haadam, or, of the same meaning as kol-haadam, "every man" (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a> (lxx, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a> : &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;); and it is yet more than improbable that the common expression, instead of which haadam kullo was available, should here have been used in a sense elsewhere unexampled. Continuing in the track of the usus loq., and particularly of the style of the author, we shall thus have to translate: "for this is every man." If we use for it: "for this is every man's," the clause becomes at once distinct; Zirkel renders kol-haadam as genit., and reckons the expression among the Graecisms of the book: &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#986;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;., &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;. Or if, with Knobel, Hitz., Bttch., and Ginsburg, we might borrow a verb to supplement the preceding imperat.: "for this ought every man to do," we should also in this way gain the meaning to be expected; but the clause lying before us is certainly a substantival clause, like meh haadam, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>, not an elliptical verbal clause, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>, where the verb to be supplied easily unfolds itself from the &#1500; of the end of the movement.<p>We have here a case which is frequent in the Semitic languages, in which subj. and pred. are connected in the form of a simple judgment, and it is left for the hearer to find out the relation sustained by the pred. to the subj. - e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, "I am prayer;" and in the Book of Koheleth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>, "the children of men are a chance." <p>(Note: Vid., Fleischer's Abh. . einige Arten der Nominalapposition, 1862, and Philippi's St. const. p. 90ff.)<p>In the same way we have here to explain: for that is every man, viz., according to his destiny and duty; excellently, Luther: for that belongs to all men. With right, Hahn, like Bauer (1732), regards the pronoun as pred. (not subj. as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a>): "this, i.e., this constituted, that they must do this, are all men," or rather: this  equals  under obligation thereto, is every man.<p>(Note: Hitz. thus renders &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-4.htm">Jeremiah 45:4</a>, predicat.: "And it is such, all the world.")<p>It is a great thought that is thereby expressed, viz., the reduction of the Israelitish law to its common human essence. This has not escaped the old Jewish teachers. What can this mean: zeh kol-haadam? it is asked, Berachoth 6b; and R. Elazar answers: "The whole world is comprehended therein;" and R. Abba bar-Cahana: "This fundamental law is of the same importance to the universe;" and R. Simeon b. Azzai: "The universe has been created only for the purpose of being commanded this." <p>(Note: Cf. Jer. Nedarim ix. 3: "Thou oughtest to love thy neighbour as thyself," says R. Akiba, is a principal sentence in the Law. Ben-Azzai says: "The words ze&#780;h ... adam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a>) are it in a yet higher degree," because therein the oneness of the origin and the destiny of all men is contained. Aben Ezra alludes to the same thing, when at the close of his Comm. he remarks: "The secret of the non-use of the divine name &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1-2:3</a> is the secret of the Book of Koheleth.") </body></html>
