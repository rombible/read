The lily is a very noble plant in the East; it grows to a considerable height, but has a weak stem. The church is weak in herself, yet is strong in Him that supports her. The wicked, the daughters of this world, who have no love to Christ, are as thorns, worthless and useless, noxious and hurtful. Corruptions are thorns in the flesh; but the lily now among thorns, shall be transplanted into that paradise where there is no brier or thorn. The world is a barren tree to the soul; but Christ is a fruitful one. And when poor souls are parched with convictions of sin, with the terrors of the law, or the troubles of this world, weary and heavy laden, they may find rest in Christ. It is not enough to pass by this shadow, but we must sit down under it. Believers have tasted that the Lord Jesus is gracious; his fruits are all the precious privileges of the new covenant, purchased by his blood, and communicated by his Spirit; promises are sweet to a believer, and precepts also. Pardons are sweet, and peace of conscience sweet. If our mouths are out of taste for the pleasures of sin, Divine consolations will be sweet to us. Christ brings the soul to seek and to find comforts through his ordinances, which are as a banqueting-house where his saints feast with him. The love of Christ, manifested by his death, and by his word, is the banner he displays, and believers resort to it. How much better is it with the soul when sick from love to Christ, than when surfeited with the love of this world! And though Christ seemed to have withdrawn, yet he was even then a very present help. All his saints are in his hand, which tenderly holds their aching heads. Finding Christ thus nigh to her, the soul is in great care that her communion with him is not interrupted. We easily grieve the Spirit by wrong tempers. Let those who have comfort, fear sinning it away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bride's answer: "As the 'tappuach' with its fragrant fruit excels the barren trees of the wild wood, so my beloved his associates and friends etc." &#1514;&#1508;&#1493;&#1495;  tappu&#770;ach may in early Hebrew have been a generic name for apple, quince, citron, orange etc.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/songs/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

As the apple tree, in a garden or orchard, excels and is preferable to the wild barren trees of a forest (k), especially it appears so when laden with choice fruit; so the church, who here returns the commendation to Christ, asserts, that he as much excels all the "sons", the creatures of God, angels or men: angels, as the Targum, who, though sons of God by creation, Christ is the Son of God, in a higher sense; he is their Creator, and the object of their worship; they are confirmed by him in the estate they are, and are ministering spirits to him; and he is exalted above them in human nature: men also, the greatest princes and monarchs of the earth, are sometimes compared to large and lofty trees; but Christ is higher than they, and is possessed of far greater power, riches, glory, and majesty. All the sons of Adam in general may be meant; wicked men, who are like forest trees, wild, barren, and unfruitful; yea, even good men, Christ has the pre-eminence of them, the sons of God by adopting grace; for he is so in such a sense they are not; he is their Creator, Lord, Head, Husband, and Saviour, and they have all their fruit from him; and so ministers of the word have their gifts and grace from him, and therefore Christ excels all that come under this appellation of sons. Christ may be compared to an apple tree, which is very fruitful; and, when full of fruit, very beautiful; and whose fruit is very cooling, comforting, and refreshing. Christ is full of the fruits and blessings of grace, which are to be reached by the hand of faith, and enjoyed; and as he is full of grace and truth, he looks very beautiful and glorious in the eye of faith; and which blessings of grace from him, being applied to a poor sensible sinner, inflamed by the fiery law, and filled with wrath and terror, sweetly cool, refresh, and comfort him. The apple tree has been accounted an hieroglyphic of love, under which lovers used to meet, and sit under its delightful shade, and entertain each other with its fruit; to which the allusion may be; see Sol 8:5; the apple was sacred to love (l). The Targum renders it, the pome citron, or citron apple tree; which is a tree very large and beautiful; its fruit is of a bitter taste, but of a good smell; always fruit on it; is an excellent remedy against poison, and good for the breath, as naturalists (m) observe; and so is a fit emblem of Christ, in the greatness of his person, in the fulness, of his grace, in the virtue of his blood, and righteousness and grace, which are a sovereign antidote against the poison of sin; and whose presence, and communion with him, cure panting souls, out of breath in seeking him; and whose mediation perfumes their breath, their prayers, whereby they become grateful to God, which otherwise would be strange and disagreeable; <p>I sat down under his shadow with great delight: under the shadow of the apple tree, to which Christ is compared; whose person, blood, and righteousness, cast a shadow, which is a protecting one, from the heat of divine wrath, from the curses of a fiery law, from the fiery darts of Satan, and from the fury of persecutors, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>; and is a cooling, comforting, and refreshing one, like the shadow of a great rock to a weary traveller, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; and though the shadow of some trees, as Pliny (n) observes, is harmful to plants that grow under them, others are fructifying; and such is Christ; "they that dwell under his shadow shall revive and grow", &amp;c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-7.htm">Hosea 14:7</a>. "Sitting" here supposes it was her choice; that she preferred Christ to any other shadow, looking upon him to be a suitable one in her circumstances, Sol 1:6; it intimates that peace, quietness, satisfaction, and security, she enjoyed under him; it denotes her continuance, and desire of abiding there, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>; for the words may be rendered, "I desired, and I sat down" (o); she desired to sit under the shade of this tree, and she did; she had what she wished for; and she sat "with great delight": having the presence of Christ, and fellowship with him in his word and ordinances, where Christ is a delightful shade to his people; <p>and his fruit was sweet to my taste; the fruit of the apple tree, to which the allusion is. Solon (p) advised the bride to eat a quince apple before she went into the bridegroom, as leaving an agreeable savour; and intimating how graceful the words of her mouth should be. By "his fruit" here are meant the blessings of grace, which are Christ's in a covenant way, come through his sufferings and death, and are at his dispose; such as peace, pardon, justification, &amp;c. and fresh discoveries and manifestations of his love, of which the apple is an emblem: and these are sweet, pleasant, and delightful, to those that have tasted that the Lord is gracious; whose vitiated taste is changed by the grace of God, and they savour the things of the Spirit of God. <p>(k) "Quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi", Virgil.

Tristram, <span class="ital">Fauna and Flora of Palestine</span>, p. 294, takes it to mean the apricot; while Delitzsch, in his commentary on Proverbs, suggests the citron or orange, but neither view has more than a slight support. As between <span class="ital">apple</span>, which is held to be the tree meant, by Löw, Prof. Robertson Smith, Dr Post in Hastings’ <span class="ital">Bible Dictionary</span>, and Prof. Driver on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-12.htm" title="The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languishes; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.">Joel 1:12</a>, and <span class="ital">quince</span>, which is supported by the authors of the article ‘Apple’ in the <span class="ital">Encycl. Bibl</span>. and others, it is difficult to choose. A strong argument against the quince is contained in the last clause of the verse. The quince is not sweet, but rather bitter, and as the reference here is to the fruit in its natural state, we cannot get over the difficulty by saying that it is delicious when sweetened. Dr Post, who is a medical man living in Syria, remarks that to-day sick persons almost invariably ask the doctor if they may have an apple, and if he objects they urge their case with the plea that they want it only to smell. This is strikingly parallel to what we have in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-5.htm" title="Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.">Song of Solomon 2:5</a></span>, and on the whole we would decide for <span class="ital">apple</span> tree.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I sat down under his shadow with great delight</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">In his shadow I delighted and sat down</span>.

In these verses the Shulammite replies, but turns her thoughts away from her royal lover to her betrothed, and compares him as contrasted with other young men to a fruitful and shady <span class="ital">tappûach</span> tree among the other trees of the wood.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</span> That these are the words of the bride there can be no doubt. The apple tree is noted for the fragrance of its blossom and the sweetness of its fruit; hence the name <span class="accented">tappuach</span>, from the root <span class="accented">naphach</span>, "to breathe sweetly." The trees of the wood or forest are specially referred to, because they are generally wild, and their fruit sour and rough, and many have no fruit or flower. The Chaldee renders, "citron;" Rosenmuller and others, "quince." The word is rare (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>). It is sometimes the tree itself, at other times the fruit. It occurs in proper names, as (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-17.htm">Joshua 12:17</a>), "The King of Tappuah," etc., and that shows that it was very early known in Palestine. It occurs frequently in the Talmud. The word is masculine, while "lily" is feminine. "I sat with delight" is expressed in true Hebrew phrase, "I delighted and sat," the intensity of feeling being expressed by the piel of the verb. By the shadow is intended both protection and refreshment; by the fruit, enjoyment. Perhaps we may go further, and say there is here a symbolical representation of the spiritual life, as both that of trust and participation. The greatness and goodness of the tree of life protects and covers the sinner, while the inner nature and Divine virtue of the Saviour comes forth in delicious fruits, in his character, words, ministry, and spiritual gifts. If there is any truth in the typical view, it must be found in such passages as this, where the metaphor is so simple and apt, and has been incorporated with all religious language as the vehicle of faith and love. Hymnology abounds in such ideas and analogies. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13 A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which lieth between by breasts.<p>14 A bunch of cypress-flowers is my beloved to me,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the vine-gardens of Engedi.<p>Most interpreters, ignoring the lessons of botany, explain Sol 1:13 of a little bunch of myrrh; but whence could Shulamith obtain this? Myrrh, &#1502;&#1512; (&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;, to move oneself in a horizontal direction hither and thither, or gradually to advance; of a fluid, to flow over the plain), <p>(Note: Vid., Schlotmann in the Stud. u. Krit. (1867), p. 217.)<p>belongs, like the frankincense, to the amyrids, which are also exotics <p>(Note: They came from Arabia and India; the better Arabian was adulterated with Indian myrrh.)<p>in Palestine; and that which is aromatic in the Balsamodendron myrrha are the leaves and flowers, but the resin (Gummi myrrhae, or merely myrrha) cannot be tied in a bunch. Thus the myrrh here can be understood in no other way than as at Sol 5:5; in general &#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;, according to Hitzig's correct remark, properly denotes not what one binds up together, but what one ties up - thus sacculus, a little bag. It is not supposed that she carried such a little bag with her (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-20.htm">Isaiah 3:20</a>), or a box of frankincense (Luth. musk-apple); but she compares her beloved to a myrrh-repository, which day and night departs not from her bosom, and penetrates her inwardly with its heart-strengthening aroma. So constantly does she think of him, and so delightful is it for her to dare to think of him as her beloved.<p>The 14th verse presents the same thought. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; is the cypress-cluster or the cypress-flowers, &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (according to Frst, from &#1499;&#1508;&#1512;  equals  &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, to be whitish, from the colour of the yellow-white flowers), which botanists call Lawsonia, and in the East Alh&#803;enna&#772;; its leaves yield the orange colour with which the Moslem women stain <p>(Note: Vid., the literature of this subject in Defrmery's notice of Dozy-Engelmann's work in the Revue Critique, III 2 (1868), p. 408.)<p>their hands and feet. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1500;, to interweave) denotes that which is woven, tresses, or a cluster or garland of their flowers. Here also we have not to suppose that Shulamith carried a bunch of flowers; in her imagination she places herself in the vine-gardens which Solomon had planted on the hill-terraces of Engedi lying on the west of the Dead Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4</a>), and chooses a cluster of flowers of the cypress growing in that tropical climate, and says that her beloved is to her internally what such a cluster of cypress-flowers would be to her externally. To be able to call him her beloved is her ornament; and to think of him refreshes her like the most fragrant flowers. </body></html>
