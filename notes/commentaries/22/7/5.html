Set with hair, thick and long, as Carmel with plants and trees. Now Christ is the church's Head in various senses; he is her federal and representative Head in eternity and time; her political Head, as a King to his subjects; an economical Head, as the husband to the wife, as parents to their children, and a master to servants; and, as such, may be compared to Carmel; for the multitude dependent on him, whom he represents, and is connected with under various relations; for his height, being higher than the kings of the earth, and all other heads; and for fruitfulness, all the fruits of the church, and of all true believers, coming from him. Some render the word, "as crimson", or "scarlet" (b); which may set forth his royal dignity and majesty, this colour being wore by kings and great personages; or the ardent love of Christ to his body, the church, and the members of it; or his bloody sufferings for them; <p>and the hair of thine head like purple; purple coloured hair has been in great esteem. Of this colour was the hair of King Nysus, according to the fable (c); and so the hair of Evadne, and of the Muses (d), were of a violet colour; the hair of Ulysses is said (e) to be like to the hyacinth flower, which is of a purple or violet colour; and Milton (f) calls the first Adam's hair hyacinthine locks; and here, in a figurative sense, the second Adam's hair is said to be like purple. By which believers that grow on Christ, the Head of the church, nay be meant, who have their dependence on him, and their strength and nourishment from him; see Sol 4:1; and these may be said to be like "purple", because of their royal dignity, being made kings unto God by Christ; and because of their being washed in the purple blood of Christ; and because of the sufferings they endure for his sake; and especially such may be so compared, who have spilt their blood and laid down their lives on his account; <p>the king is held in the galleries; the same with the Head of the church, the King of Zion, and King of saints, whose kingdom is a spiritual and everlasting one: and by the "galleries" in which he is held may be meant the ordinances of the Gospel; where Christ and his people walk and converse together; where he discloses the secrets of his heart to them, leads them into a further acquaintance with his covenant, and the blessings and promises of it; and from whence they have delightful views of his person and fulness; see the King in his beauty, and behold the good land which is afar off: the same word as here is rendered "rafters", and by some "canals", in Sol 1:17; See Gill on Sol 1:17. Now Christ being said to be "held in these galleries" may signify his fixed habitation in his house and ordinances; where he has promised to dwell, and delights to be; and where he is as it were fastened to them, and hatred in them. <p>(b) "veluti coccinum", Pagninus, Vatablus, Mercerus; "simile est coccineo", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "est ut coccus", Piscator; so Ainsworth; "sicut carmesinum", Schindler.

The A.V. margin, following some Jewish authorities, renders ‘crimson,’ regarding <span class="ital">karmel</span> as equivalent to <span class="ital">karmîl</span>, and Ginsburg, adopting this explanation, thinks that the words mean that her hair was arranged in the form of a murex shell.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the hair of thine head</span>] The word translated ‘hair,’ which occurs nowhere else in the O.T., appears to mean <span class="bld">flowing tresses</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">like purple</span>] Apparently the text means to indicate that the bride’s hair was of that intense black which is sometimes called blue black.

That is hardly satisfactory, but that tresses is intended seems certain. The idea of a lover being held captive in the hair of his lady is common in the love poetry of all lands. Cp. Lovelace’s poem <span class="ital">To Althea from Prison</span>:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“When I lie tangled in her hair,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And fettered to her eye,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The birds that wanton in the air<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Know no such liberty.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Budde and Siegfried take the ‘king’ here to mean as usual the young husband of the king’s week.

It is a promontory. The meaning, no doubt, is the exquisite fitness of the head upon the neck, which is one of the most lovely traits of personal beauty. Some, however, think that the reference is to colour - Carmel being derived from the Persian, and meaning "crimson." This is rejected by Delitzsch, as the Persian would be <span class="accented">carmile</span>, not <span class="accented">carmel</span>. The transition is natural from the position and shape of the head and neck to the hair. The purple shellfish is found near Carmel (cf. Lucian's <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and Anacreon's <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and similar expressions in Virgil's 'Georgics,' 1:405, and Tibullus, 1:4, 63). The locks of hair are a glistening purple colour, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their black is purple as they catch the lights. Hengstenberg, however, thinks that the reference is to the temples, and not to the hair itself; but the use of the term in classical poets is decisive. The lovely head shaking the locks as the body moves gracefully in the dance fills the king with delight and admiration. He is quite captivated, and the ladies, having finished their description of the bride, look at the bridegroom, and behold him quite lost in the fascination - "held captive in the tresses." Delitzsch quotes a similar expression from Goethe, in the 'West Ostliche Divan,' "There are more than fifty hooks in each lock of thy hair." The idea of taking captive is frequent in Hebrew poetry (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>; Sirach 9:3, 4). Thus ends the song of the ladies in praise of the bride. We must suppose that the king, who is probably present, then takes up the word, and pours out his heart. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11 To the nut garden I went down<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To look at the shrubs of the valley,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see whether the vine sprouted,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pomegranates budded.<p>12 I knew it not that my soul lifted me up<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the royal chariots of my people, a noble (one).<p>In her loneliness she is happy; she finds her delight in quietly moving about in the vegetable world; the vine and the pomegranate, brought from her home, are her favourites. Her soul - viz. love for Solomon, which fills her soul - raised her to the royal chariots of her people, the royal chariots of a noble (one), where she sits besides the king, who drives the chariot; she knew this, but she also knew it not for what she had become without any cause of her own, that she is without self-elation and without disavowal of her origin. These are Shulamith's thoughts and feelings, which we think we derive from these two verses without reading between the lines and without refining. It went down, she says, viz., from the royal palace, cf. Sol 6:2. Then, further, she speaks of a valley; and the whole sounds rural, so that we are led to think of Etam as the scene. This Etam, romantically (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-8.htm">Judges 15:8</a> f.) situated, was, as Josephus (Antt. viii. 7. 3) credibly informs us, Solomon's Belvedere. "In the royal stables," he says, "so great was the regard for beauty and swiftness, that nowhere else could horses of greater beauty or greater fleetness be found. All had to acknowledge that the appearance of the king's horses was wonderfully pleasing, and that their swiftness was incomparable. Their riders also served as an ornament to them. They were young men in the flower of their age, and were distinguished by their lofty stature and their flowing hair, and by their clothing, which was of Tyrian purple. They every day sprinkled their hair with dust of gold, so that their whole head sparkled when the sun shone upon it. In such array, armed and bearing bows, they formed a body-guard around the king, who was wont, clothed in a white garment, to go out of the city in the morning, and even to drive his chariot. These morning excursions were usually to a certain place which was about sixty stadia from Jerusalem, and which was called Etam; gardens and brooks made it as pleasant as it was fruitful." This Etam, from whence (the &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;&#1501;) <p>(Note: According to Sebachim 54b, one of the highest points of the Holy Land.))<p>a watercourse, the ruins of which are still visible, supplied the temple with water, has been identified by Robinson with a village called Artas (by Lumley called Urtas), about a mile and a half to the south of Bethlehem. At the upper end of the winding valley, at a considerable height above the bottom, are three old Solomonic pools, - large, oblong basins of considerable compass placed one behind the other in terraces. Almost at an equal height with the highest pool, at a distance of several hundred steps there is a strong fountain, which is carefully built over, and to which there is a descent by means of stairs inside the building. By it principally were the pools, which are just large reservoirs, fed, and the water was conducted by a subterranean conduit into the upper pool. Riding along the way close to the aqueduct, which still exists, one sees even at the present day the valley below clothed in rich vegetation; and it is easy to understand that here there may have been rich gardens and pleasure-grounds (Moritz Lttke's Mittheilung). A more suitable place for this first scene of the fifth Act cannot be thought of; and what Josephus relates serves remarkably to illustrate not only the description of Sol 6:11, but also that of Sol 6:12. <p>&#1488;&#1490;&#1493;&#1494; is the walnut, i.e., the Italian nut tree (Juglans regia L.), originally brought from Persia; the Persian name is jeuz, Aethiop. gu&#770;z, Arab. Syr. gauz (go&#770;z), in Heb. with &#1488; prosth., like the Armen. engus. &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1490;&#1493;&#1494; is a garden, the peculiar ornament of which is the fragrant and shady walnut tree; &#1490;&#1504;&#1514; &#1488;&#1490;&#1493;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; would not be a nut garden, but a garden of nuts, for the plur. signifies, Mishn. nuces (viz., juglandes  equals  Jovis glandes, Pliny, xvii. 136, ed. Jan.), as &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, figs, in contradistinction to &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, a fig tree, only the Midrash uses &#1488;&#1490;&#1493;&#1494;&#1492; here, elsewhere not occurring, of a tree. The object of her going down was one, viz., to observe the state of the vegetation; but it was manifold, as expressed in the manifold statements which follow &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The first object was the nut garden. Then her intention was to observe the young shoots in the valley, which one has to think of as traversed by a river or brook; for &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, like Wady, signifies both a valley and a valley-brook. The nut garden might lie in the valley, for the walnut tree is fond of a moderately cool, damp soil (Joseph. Bell. iii. 10. 8). But the &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; are the young shoots with which the banks of a brook and the damp valley are usually adorned in the spring-time. &#1488;&#1489;, shoot, in the Heb. of budding and growth, in Aram. of the fruit-formation, comes from R. &#1488;&#1489;, the weaker power of &#1504;&#1489;, which signifies to expand and spread from within outward, and particularly to sprout up and to well forth. &#1489; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; signifies here, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-1.htm">Genesis 34:1</a>, attentively to observe something, looking to be fixed upon it, to sink down into it. A further object was to observe whether the vine had broken out, or had budded (this is the meaning of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;, breaking out, to send forth, R. &#1508;&#1512;, to break), <p>(Note: Vid., Friedh. Delitzsch, Indo-Germ. Sem. Studien, p. 72.)<p> - whether the pomegranate trees had gained flowers or flower-buds &#1492;&#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, not as Gesen. in his Thes. and Heb.

The question goes along with that regarding the origin and signification of Rimmon, the name of the Syrian god, which appears to denote <p>continued...</body></html>
