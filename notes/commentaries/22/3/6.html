A poor soul shall come up, at last, under the conduct of the Comforter; like a cloud of incense ascending from the altar, or the smoke of the burnt-offerings. This signifies pious and devout affections, and the mounting of the soul heaven-ward. The believer is filled with the graces of God's Spirit; his devotions now are very lively. These graces and comforts are from the heavenly Canaan. He, who is the Peace of his people, the King of the heavenly Zion, has provided for the safe conveyance of his redeemed through the wilderness of this world. The bed, or palanquin, was contrived for rest and easy conveyance, but its beauty and magnificence showed the quality of its owner. The church is well guarded; more are with her than are against her: believers, when they repose in Christ, and with him, though they have their fears in the night, are yet safe. The chariot here denotes the covenant of redemption, the way of our salvation. This is that work of Christ, which makes him loved and admired in the eyes of believers. It is framed and contrived, both for the glory of Christ, and for the comfort of believers; it is well ordered in all things and sure. The blood of the covenant, that rich purple, is the cover of this chariot, by which believers are sheltered from the wind and storms of Divine wrath, and the troubles of this world; but the midst of it is that love of Christ which passes knowledge, this is for believers to repose upon. Christ, in his gospel, manifests himself. Take special notice of his crown. Applying this to Christ, it speaks the honour put upon him, and his power and dominion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The principal and central action of the Song; the bride's entry into the city of David, and her marriage there with the king.

Balaam, the last representative of patriarchism, was required to curse the Jewish Church, just as it afterwards would not succumb to Christianity without a struggle (Nu 22:41), but he had to bless in language like that here (Nu 24:5, 6). Angels too joyfully ask the same question, when Jesus Christ with the tabernacle of His body (answering to "His bed," So 3:7; Joh 1:14, "dwelt," Greek "tabernacled," Joh 2:21) ascends into heaven (Ps 24:8-10); also when they see His glorious bride with Him (Ps 68:18; Re 7:13-17).

Hereafter she shall "come" (So 3:6, 11) in a glorified body, too (Php 3:21). Historically, Jesus Christ returning from the wilderness, full of the Holy Ghost (Lu 4:1, 14).

This is said by the daughters of Jerusalem, adjured in Sol 3:5; who, upon the happy meeting of Christ and his church, saw a greater glory and beauty in her than they had seen before; and therefore put this question, not as ignorant of her, but as admiring at her. By the wilderness she is said to "come out" of is meant either a state of nature, as Theodoret; in which all the elect of God are before conversion, and out of which they are brought by efficacious grace; called a wilderness, because of the barrenness and unfruitfulness of persons in such a state; and because of the perplexed ways and tracks in it, which bewilder a man that he knows not which to take; and because of the want of spiritual provisions in it; and because of the danger men are exposed unto through holes and pits, and beasts of prey: in such a state God finds his people, convinces them of it, and brings them out of it; which is an instance of surprising and distinguishing grace: or else the world itself may be meant, the wilderness of the people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-35.htm">Ezekiel 20:35</a>; so called because of the roughness of the way, the many tribulations the saints pass through in it; and because of the traps and snares that are in it, through evil men, the lusts of the flesh, and the temptations of Satan; because of the many evil beasts in it, ungodly men, false teachers, and Satan the roaring lion; and because of the plentiful table God furnishes here for his people, feeding them in the wilderness with Gospel doctrines and spiritual ordinances, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>; and because of the many windings and turnings of Providence in it, through all which they are led in a right way to the city of their habitation: now though they are in the world, they are not of it; they are called out of it, and quit as much as may be the company and conversation of the men of it; and through the grace of God are more and more weaned from it, and long after another and better world; all which may be intended by their coming out of this: or else this may design a state of sorrow and distress when under desertion, and without the presence of Christ; which had lately been the case of the church, who had been in a bewildered condition, and not knowing where her beloved was, ran about here and there in quest of him, like one in a wood, seeking him and calling after him; but now having sight of him, and some communion with him, is represented as coming out of that state. She is further described as being <p>like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense; her heart being inflamed with love to Christ, her affections moved upwards, heavenwards, and were set on things above; and which were sincere and upright, rose up in the form of palm trees, as the word (n) signifies, a very upright tree; and these moved steadily towards Christ, and could not be diverted from him by the winds of temptation, affliction, and persecution; and though there might be some degree of dulness and imperfection in them, hence called "pillars of smoke"; yet being perfumed with the sweet smelling myrrh of Christ's sacrifice, and the incense of his mediation, became acceptable to God. It is added, <p>with all powders of the merchant: odorous ones, such are the graces of the Spirit, which Christ the merchantman is full of; and makes his people, their affections and prayers, of a sweet smelling savour with. Ben Melech interprets it of garments perfumed with spices; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; Some render the words, "above" or "more excellent than all powders of the merchant" (o), druggist or apothecary (p); no such drug nor spice to be found in their shops, that smell so sweet as Christ, his grace and righteousness. <p>(n) "ut columnae ad formam palmae assurgntes", Buxtorf; "ut palmae", Mercerus, Cocceius; "instar palmarum", Tigurine version, Michaelis.

Hence many hold that the verse is spoken of a woman, either of a princess whom Solomon, even in the midst of his wooing of the Shulammite, is about to marry, or of the Shulammite, who is seen approaching Jerusalem with Solomon as her husband in a bridal procession. But it need not necessarily be so. <span class="ital">This</span> may be taken as neuter, the fem. often representing the neuter, as there is no special neuter form in Heb. In that case the translation here would be literally ‘Who is that which cometh up?’ This is strictly parallel to Esau’s question to Jacob, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-8.htm" title="And he said, What mean you by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.">Genesis 33:8</a>, “Who is all this camp?” i.e. ‘Who are the human beings in it?’ (Cp. Davidson, <span class="ital">Heb. Synt</span>. § 8, R. 1, and Ewald, <span class="ital">Heb. Synt</span>. E. T. p. 196.) This view is more in accord with the following words: for, obviously, the procession is too remote to permit of the spectators who speak here knowing that any lady in it is perfumed with myrrh, &c. It must, therefore, be the thing seen, not any person, which is perfumed. The idea is that something surrounded with incense, naturally supposed to be perfumed, is approaching. “The pomp is like that of a procession before which the censer of frankincense is swung” (Del.). <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-7.htm" title="Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; three score valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.">Song of Solomon 3:7</a> tells us that <span class="ital">this</span> is the <span class="ital">miṭṭâh</span> of Solomon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">out of the wilderness</span>] i.e. from the pasture lands as distinct from the cultivated lands. This is quite unintelligible on Budde’s hypothesis. Cp. Appendix ii, § 9.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">like pillars of smoke</span>] This expression strengthens the view taken of the last clause. <span class="ital">This</span> which is like pillars of smoke cannot be a person, but must be a litter or procession which is overhung by, or surrounded with, columns of smoke. The word for columns <span class="ital">tîmǎrôth</span> occurs again in the O.T. only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-30.htm" title="And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.">Joel 2:30</a> (Heb., 3:3). The LXX translate it by στελέχη, ‘trunks’ of smoke, evidently connecting the word with <span class="ital">tâmâr</span>, ‘a palm tree,’ to which a rising column of smoke has a great resemblance. It spreads out only at the top of the column-like stem, like a palm tree above its trunk. More probably, however, it is derived from a verb <span class="ital">yâmar</span> = <span class="ital">’âmar</span>, the original meaning of which was ‘to rise high.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">perfumed</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">incensed</span>, i.e. having incense burnt before it. The couch or litter, or the procession, is having perfume burnt before it, viz. myrrh and frankincense. For the former cp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-13.htm" title="A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved to me; he shall lie all night between my breasts.">Song of Solomon 1:13</a>, and for the latter Tristram, <span class="ital">Nat.

"Who is this coming?" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, feminine); that is, "Who is this lady coming?" There could be no difficulty in discerning that it was a bridal procession which is seen. Curiosity always asks, "What bride is this?" "Who is <span class="accented">she?"</span> not, "Who is he?" A maiden from Galilee is being conducted to Jerusalem; the procession naturally passes through the valley of the Jordan (Ghor). There is splendour and majesty in the sight. It must be some one coming to the royal palace. The censers of frankincense are being swung to and fro and filling the air with fragrant smoke. Columns of dust and smoke from the burning incense rise up to heaven, and mark the line of progress before and after. "The spices of Arabia" were famous at all times. Hence the names of the perfumes are Arabic, as <span class="accented">murr, levona</span>, and the travelling spice merchant, or trader, was Arabic (cf. the Arabic elixir). We can scarcely miss the typical colouring in such a representation - the <span class="accented">wilderness</span>, typical of bondage and humiliation, sin and misery, out of which the bride is brought; the onward progress towards a glorious destination (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1</a>:16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a>). The Church must pass through the wilderness to her royal home, and the soul must be led out of the wilderness of sin and unbelief into everlasting union with her Lord. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Shulamith now further relates, in a dramatic, lively manner, what she said to her beloved after she had saluted him in a song:<p>17 Till the day cools and the shadows flee away,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn; make haste, my beloved,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a gazelle or a young one of the hinds<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the craggy mountains.<p>With the perf., &#1506;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473; (cf. &#1488;&#1501; &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-33.htm">Genesis 24:33</a>) signifies, till something is done; with the fut., till something will be done. Thus: till the evening comes - and, therefore, before it comes - may he do what she requires of him. Most interpreters explain &#1505;&#1489;, verte te, with the supplement ad me; according to which Jerome, Castell., and others translate by revertere. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-21.htm">Psalm 71:21</a> does not warrant this rendering; and if Shulamith has her beloved before her, then by &#1505;&#1489; she can only point him away from herself; the parall. Sol 8:14 has &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495; instead of &#1505;&#1489;, which consequently means, "turn thyself from here away." Rather we may suppose, as I explained in 1851, that she holds him in her embrace, as she says, and inseparable from him, will wander with him upon the mountains. But neither that ad me nor this mecum should have been here (cf. on the contrary Sol 8:14) unexpressed. We hold by what is written. Solomon surprises Shulamith, and invites her to enjoy with him the spring-time; not alone, because he is on a hunting expedition, and - as denoted by "catch us" (v. 15) - with a retinue of followers. She knows that the king has not now time to wander at leisure with her; and therefore she asks him to set forward his work for the day, and to make haste on the mountains till "the day cools and the shadows flee." Then she will expect him back; then in the evening she will spend the time with him as he promised her. The verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, with the guttural letter Hheth and the labial Pe, signifies spirare, here of being able to be breathed, i.e., cool, like the expression ha' &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a> (where the guttural Hheth is connected with Resh). The shadows flee away, when they become longer and longer, as if on a flight, when they stretch out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-23.htm">Psalm 109:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-12.htm">Psalm 102:12</a>) and gradually disappear. Till that takes place - or, as we say, will be done - he shall hasten with the swiftness of a gazelle on the mountains, and that on the mountains of separation, i.e., the riven mountains, which thus present hindrances, but which he, the "swift as the gazelle" (vid., Sol 2:9), easily overcomes. Rightly, Bochart: montes scissionis, ita dicti propter, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; et &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;. Also, Luther's "Scheideberge" are "mountains with peaks, from one of which to the other one must spring." We must not here think of Bithron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-29.htm">2 Samuel 2:29</a>), for that is a mountain ravine on the east of Jordan; nor of Bar-Cochba's &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512; (Kirschbau, Landau), because this mountain (whether it be sought for to the south of Jerusalem or to be north of Antipatris) ought properly to be named &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1514;&#1512; (vid., Aruch). It is worthy of observation, that in an Assyrian list of the names of animals, along with s&#803;bi (gazelle) and apparu (the young of the gazelle or of the hind), the name bitru occurs, perhaps the name of the rupicapra. At the close of the song, the expression "mountain of spices" occurs instead of "mountain of separation," as here. There no more hindrances to be overcome lie in view, the rock-cliffs have become fragrant flowers. The request here made by Shulamith breathes self-denying humility, patient modesty, inward joy in the joy of her beloved. She will not claim him for herself till he has accomplished his work. But when he associates with her in the evening, as with the Emmaus disciples, she will rejoice if he becomes her guide through the new-born world of spring. The whole scene permits, yea, moves us to think of this, that the Lord already even now visits the church which loves Him, and reveals Himself to her; but that not till the evening of the world is His parousia to be expected. </body></html>
