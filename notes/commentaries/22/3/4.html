The night is a time of coldness, darkness, and drowsiness, and of dim apprehensions concerning spiritual things. At first, when uneasy, some feeble efforts are made to obtain the comfort of communion with Christ. This proves in vain; the believer is then roused to increased diligence. The streets and broad-ways seem to imply the means of grace in which the Lord is to be sought. Application is made to those who watch for men's souls. Immediate satisfaction is not found. We must not rest in any means, but by faith apply directly to Christ. The holding of Christ, and not letting him go, denotes earnest cleaving to him. What prevails is a humble, ardent suing by prayer, with a lively exercise of faith on his promises. So long as the faith of believers keeps hold of Christ, he will not be offended at their earnest asking, yea, he is well pleased with it. The believer desires to make others acquainted with his Saviour. Wherever we find Christ, we must take him home with us to our houses, especially to our hearts; and we should call upon ourselves and each other, to beware of grieving our holy Comforter, and provoking the departure of the Beloved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I held him - This begins the fourth stanza.

Jesus Christ is generally "found" near the watchmen and means of grace; but they are not Himself; the star that points to Beth-lehem is not the Sun that has risen there; she hastens past the guideposts to the goal [Moody Stuart]. Not even angels could satisfy Mary, instead of Jesus Christ (Joh 20:11-16).<p>found him&#8212;(Isa 45:19; Ho 6:1-3; Mt 13:44-46).<p>held him, &c.&#8212;willing to be held; not willing, if not held (Ge 32:26; Mt 28:9; Lu 24:28, 29; Re 3:11). "As a little weeping child will hold its mother fast, not because it is stronger than she, but because her bowels constrain her not to leave it; so Jesus Christ yearning over the believer cannot go, because He will not" [Durham]. In So 1:4 it is He who leads the bride into His chambers; here it is she who leads Him into her mother's. There are times when the grace of Jesus Christ seems to draw us to Him; and others, when we with strong cries draw Him to us and ours. In the East one large apartment often serves for the whole family; so the bride here speaks of her mother's apartment and her own together. The mention of the "mother" excludes impropriety, and imparts the idea of heavenly love, pure as a sister's, while ardent as a bride's; hence the frequent title, "my sister&#8212;spouse." Our mother after the Spirit, is the Church, the new Jerusalem (Joh 3:5-8; Ga 4:19, 26); for her we ought to pray continually (Eph 3:14-19), also for the national Jerusalem (Isa 62:6, 7; Ro 10:1), also for the human family, which is our mother and kindred after the flesh; these our mother's children have evilly treated us (So 1:6); but, like our Father, we are to return good for evil (Mt 5:44, 45), and so bring Jesus Christ home to them (1Pe 2:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/songs/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I found him; </span> Christ met me, and manifested his love to me, according to his promise made to those that seek him constantly and diligently, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-17.htm" title="I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.">Proverbs 8:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm" title="Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you:">Matthew 7:7</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I held him, and would not let him go, </span> being taught by my late experience how doleful a thing it was to lose him, and how hard it was to find and recover him when he was lost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Until I had brought him into my mother’s house, </span> that there I might entertain and embrace him, and gain my mother’s consent, and so proceed to the consummation of the marriage.

But all particulars in allegorical scriptures are not to be strictly urged, as all learned interpreters agree, many being added only for the decency of the allegory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Her that conceived me; </span> Christ is as it were the father that begets, and the church the mother that conceiveth and bringeth forth, believers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/songs/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It was but a little that I passed from them,.... Either a small moment of time, as the Targum and Aben Ezra; or a little distance of place, that is, from the watchmen or ministers, from whom she passed; not through disrespect to them, much less contempt of them; nor because she received no benefit at all from them; but her going on shows she did not rest in means, but looked beyond them, and went on further in the exercise of her faith, and hope of finding her beloved: and meeting with him a little after she had passed from the ministers suggests that Christ is not far from his ministers and ordinances; for it follows, <p>but I found him whom my soul loveth; which she expresses with the utmost exultation and pleasure, which meeting with him must give her, after such long and fruitless searches, and so many disappointments; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41</a>; and for Christ to show himself, without which there is no finding him, is a proof of the greatness of his love, and of the freeness and sovereignty of it; and that means, though to be used, are not to be depended on; nor should we be discouraged when they fail, since Christ can make himself known without them, as he did here to the church; who says, <p>I held him, and would not let him go; which on the part of the church is expressive of her faith in him, signified by laying hold on him, his person, righteousness, grace, and strength, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>; and of her strong affection to him, grasping and embracing him in her arms of faith and love; and of her fear and jealousy lest he should depart from her again; and of her steady resolution to hold him, whatever was the consequence of it: and, on his part, it intimates a seeming offer to be gone; and a gracious allowance to lay hold on him; and his wonderful condescension to be held by her; and the delight and pleasure he took in the exercise of her faith upon him; for it was not against but with his will he was held by her; and this she determined to do, and not let go her hold, <p>until, says she, <p>I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chambers of her that conceived me; the allusion is to the tents and apartments women had in former times, distinct from their husbands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-67.htm">Genesis 24:67</a>; and all this may be understood either of the visible church, and the ordinances of it, the mother of all true believers, where they are born again, brought up and nourished; and where Christ may be said to be brought, when his name is professed, his Gospel is embraced, and his ordinances are submitted to; and here the church is desirous of introducing Christ, that she with others might magnify him, and praise him for all the instances of his grace and goodness, and have communion with him: or else the heart, and the inmost recesses of it, may be meant; where the incorruptible seed of divine grace is cast; where the new creature; conceived, born, and brought up, until it becomes a perfect man; and where Christ is desired to be, and to dwell by faith, and saints may have uninterrupted communion with him: unless the heavenly mansions are intended, the house of the Jerusalem above, the mother of us all; where saints long to be with Christ, enjoy him, and never lose his presence more; till then the church resolves to hold him fast in the arms of faith, hope, and love, and not let him go. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/songs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/songs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

The lover was not far off, though he had delayed his coming. Possibly it is a real occurrence which is related. In that case we must suppose that the night was not very far advanced. But the hypothesis of a dream is the most natural explanation. The word <span class="accented">cherer</span>, which is used of the house, denotes the inner part, <span class="accented">penetralia.</span> The modesty of the last clause is very beautiful. The mother would, of course, at that time be in her sleeping chamber. There alone would the maiden receive her lover at such a time. The mother would gladly welcome the young man, and thus the love which Shulamith declares is set upon the ground of perfect chastity and homely purity. The object of this little episode introduced by the bride into her song as she lies in the arms of Solomon is to show that, ecstatic and intense as her devotion is, it is not the lawless affection of a concubine, but the love of a noble wife. The religious emotions are always presented to us in Scripture, not as wild fanaticism or superficial excitement, but as pure offering of the heart which blends with the highest relations and interests of human life, and sanctifies home and country with all their ties and obligations. The mother and the child are one in the new atmosphere of bridal joy. No religion is worthy of the name which does not bring its object into the chamber of her who conceived us. We love all that are bound with us in life not the less, but the more, because we love Christ supremely. We revere all that is just and holy in the common world the more, and not the less, because we worship God and serve the Lord. What a rebuke to asceticism, monasticism, and all unsocial religion! <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows a cantiuncula. Shulamith comes forward, and, singing, salutes her beloved. Their love shall celebrate a new spring. Thus she wishes everything removed, or rendered harmless, that would disturb the peace of this love:<p>15 Catch us the foxes, the little foxes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spoilers of the vineyards;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For our vineyards are in bloom!<p>16 My beloved is mine, and I am his;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who feeds his flock among the lilies.<p>If the king is now, on this visit of the beloved, engaged in hunting, the call: "Catch us," etc., if it is directed at all to any definite persons, is addressed to those who follow him. But this is a vine-dresser's ditty, in accord with Shulamith's experience as the keeper of a vineyard, which, in a figure, aims at her love-relation. The vineyards, beautiful with fragrant blossom, point to her covenant of love; and the foxes, the little foxes, which might destroy these united vineyards, point to all the great and little enemies and adverse circumstances which threaten to gnaw and destroy love in the blossom, ere it has reached the ripeness of full enjoyment. &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; comprehends both foxes and jackals, which "destroy or injure the vineyards; because, by their holes and passages which they form in the ground, loosening the soil, so that the growth and prosperity of the vine suffers injury" (Hitzig). This word is from &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500; (R. &#1513;&#1500;), to go down, or into the depth. The little foxes are perhaps the jackals, which are called ta&#780;nni&#772;m, from their extended form, and in height are seldom more than fifteen inches. The word "jackal" has nothing to do with &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, but is the Persian-Turkish shaghal, which comes from the Sanscr. crga&#770;la, the howler (R. krag, like kap-a&#770;la, the skull; R. kap, to be arched). Moreover, the mention of the foxes naturally follows 14a, for they are at home among rocky ravines. Hitzig supposes Shulamith to address the foxes: hold for us  equals  wait, ye rascals! But &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, Aram. &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, does not signify to wait, but to seize or lay hold of (synon. &#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4</a>), as the lion its prey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>. And the plur. of address is explained from its being made to the king's retinue, or to all who could and would give help. Fox-hunting is still, and has been from old times, a sport of rich landowners; and that the smaller landowners also sought to free themselves from them by means of snares or otherwise, is a matter of course, - they are proverbially as destroyers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-35.htm">Nehemiah 3:35</a> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>], and therefore a figure of the false prophets, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-4.htm">Ezekiel 13:4</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; are here instead of &#1502;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;. The articles are generally omitted, because poetry is not fond of the article, where, as here (cf. on the other hand, Sol 1:6), the thoughts and language permit it; and the fivefold m is an intentional mere verborum sonus. The clause &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512; &#1505;&#1502;&#1491;&#1512; is an explanatory one, as appears from the Vav and the subj. preceding, as well as from the want of a finitum. &#1505;&#1502;&#1491;&#1512; maintains here also, in pausa, the sharpening of the final syllable, as &#1495;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-42.htm">Deuteronomy 28:42</a>.<p>The 16th verse is connected with the 15th. Shulamith, in the pentast. song, celebrates her love-relation; for the praise of it extends into Sol 2:15, is continued in Sol 2:16, and not till Sol 2:17 does she address her beloved. Luther translates:<p>My beloved is mine, and I am his;<p>He feeds (his flock) among the roses.<p>He has here also changed the "lilies" of the Vulgate into "roses;" for of the two queens among the flowers, he gave the preference to the popular and common rose; besides, he rightly does not translate &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, in the mid. after the pascitur inter lilia of the Vulgate: who feeds himself, i.e., pleases himself; for &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; has this meaning only when the object expressly follows, and it is evident that &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493; cannot possibly be this object, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>, - the object is thus to be supplied. And which? Without doubt, gregem; and if Heiligst., with the advocates of the shepherd-hypothesis, understands this feeding (of the flock) among the lilies, of feeding on a flowery meadow, nothing can be said against it. But at Sol 6:2., where this saying of Shulamith is repeated, she says that her beloved &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; feeds and gathers lilies. On this the literal interpretation of the qui pascit (gregem) inter lilia is wrecked; for a shepherd, such as the shepherd-hypothesis supposes, were he to feed his flock in a garden, would be nothing better than a thief; such shepherds, also, do not concern themselves with the plucking of flowers, but spend their time in knitting stockings. It is Solomon, the king, of whom Shulamith speaks. She represents him to herself as a shepherd; but in such a manner that, at the same time, she describes his actions in language which rises above ordinary shepherd-life, and, so to speak, idealizes. She, who was herself a shepherdess, knows from her own circle of thought nothing more lovely or more honourable to conceive and to say of him, than that he is a shepherd who feeds among lilies. The locality and the surroundings of his daily work correspond to his nature, which is altogether beauty and love. Lilies, the emblem of unapproachable highness, awe-inspiring purity, lofty elevation above what is common, bloom where the lily-like (king) wanders, whom the Lily names her own. The mystic interpretation and mode of speaking takes "lilies" as the figurative name of holy souls, and a lily-stalk as the symbol of the life of regeneration. Mary, who is celebrated in song as the rosa mystica, is rightly represented in ancient pictures with a lily in her hand on the occasion of the Annunciation; for if the people of God are called by Jewish poets "a people of lilies," she is, within this lily-community, this communio sanctorum, the lily without a parallel. </body></html>
