Christ goes forth subduing his enemies, while his followers gain victories over the world, the flesh, and the devil. He shows the tenderness of a Redeemer, the delight he takes in his redeemed people, and the workings of his own grace in them. True believers alone can possess the beauty of holiness. And when their real character is known, it will be commended. Both the church and believers, at their first conversion, look forth as the morning, their light being small, but increasing. As to their sanctification, they are fair as the moon, deriving all their light, grace, and holiness from Christ; and as to justification, clear as the sun, clothed with Christ, the Sun of righteousness, and fighting the good fight of faith, under the banners of Christ, against all spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even for the king the gentle eyes of the bride have an awe-striking majesty. Such is the condescension of love.

The two descriptions belong, according to some (Christian) expositors, to the Church of different periods, e. g. to the primitive Church in the splendor of her first vocation, and to the Church under Constantine; other (Jewish) expositors apply them to "the congregation of Israel" under the first and second temples respectively.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/songs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. threescore&#8212;indefinite number, as in So 3:7.

In this verse and Sol 6:9 the church is commended as she stood related to others; and is compared with them, and preferred to them. The words may be considered either as an assertion, "there are", &amp;c. or as a supposition, "though there be", &amp;c. yet Christ's church is but one, and excels them all. "Queens" are principal and lawful wives of kings; "concubines", secondary or half wives, as the word (i) signifies; who were admitted to the bed, but their children did not inherit: "virgins", unmarried persons, maids of honour, who waited on the queen. The allusion is to the custom of kings and great personages, who had many wives, and more concubines, and a large number of virgins to wait on them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>; or to a nuptial solemnity, and the ceremony of introducing the bride to the bridegroom, attended with a large number of persons of distinction; and so Theocritus (k) speaks of four times sixty virgins attending the nuptials of Menelaus and Helena; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>. By all which may be meant either the kingdoms and nations of the world; by "queens", the more large, rich and flourishing kingdoms; by "concubines", inferior states; and by "virgins without number", the vast multitudes of inhabitants that fill them; but all, put together, are not equal to the church; see Sol 2:2; or else false churches; by "queens", such who boast of their riches and number, as the church of Rome, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a>; by "concubines", such as are inferior in those things, but equally corrupt, as Arians, Socinians, &amp;c. and by "virgins without number", the multitudes of poor, weak, ignorant people, seduced by them; and what figure soever these make, or pretensions to be the true churches of Christ, they are none of his, his spouse is preferred to them all. Or rather true believers in Christ, of different degrees, are here meant; queens, those that have the greatest share of gifts grace, most nearness to Christ, and communion with him; by "concubines", believers of a lower class, and of a more servile spirit, and yet sometimes are favoured with, fellowship with Christ; and by "virgins", young converts, who have not so large an experience as the former; and this distribution agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-13.htm">1 John 2:13</a>; and the rather this may be the sense, since each of these are said to praise the church in Sol 6:9, who is preferable to them, and includes them all. <p>(i) "secundariae uxores", Michaelis.

This is evidently a description of a hareem, and it can only be Solomon’s own. The word translated <span class="ital">are</span> here is somewhat anomalous, and Budde would substitute ‘to Solomon are.’ But this is a much more moderate hareem than the account of Solomon’s given in the historical books would lead us to expect, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm" title="And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.">1 Kings 11:3</a>, where we read of 700 wives and 300 concubines. Solomon being here the speaker, it is natural that he should in his present circumstances minimise the size of his establishment, and veil it under the vague last phrase.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">queens</span>] These are wives of royal birth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">concubines</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">pîlaghshîm</span>, plur. of <span class="ital">pîlegesh</span> or <span class="ital">pillegesh</span>, appears in Greek as πάλλαξ, παλλακή, and is probably there a loan word from the Semitic peoples. But the derivation is unknown. Oettli says that as the king speaks here, he witnesses against Delitzsch’s idea that he was united in marriage to the Shulammite in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-1.htm" title="I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>, by using the word <span class="ital">tammâthî</span>, ‘my undefiled’; but that is surely to press the word too far. Marriage was not regarded as impairing a woman’s purity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">virgins</span>] The word used here, <span class="ital">‘ǎlâmôth</span>, does not necessarily mean ‘virgins,’ but young women of marriageable age. Consequently, either subordinate members of the hareem, or young women not yet, but about to be, taken into it are intended.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There are three score queens, and four score concubines, and virgins without number. My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</span> The account given us of Solomon's harem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a> represents the number as much larger. Is not that because the time referred to in the poem was early in the reign? The words are an echo of what we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>. Perhaps the general meaning is merely to celebrate the surpassing beauty of the new bride. But there certainly is a special stress laid on her purity and innocence. There is no necessity to seek for any exact interpretation of the queens and concubines. They represent female beauty in its variety. The true Church is in closer relation to the Bridegroom than all the rest of the world. Even in the heathen and unconverted world there is a revelation of the Word, or, as the ancient Fathers of the Church said, a <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. He was then as light, though the darkness comprehended him not. The perfection of the true bride of the Lamb will be acknowledged even by those who are not professedly Christian. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>2 My beloved has gone down into the garden,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the beds of sweet herbs,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To feed in the gardens<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And gather lilies.<p>He is certainly, she means to say, there to be found where he delights most to tarry. He will have gone down - viz. from the palace (Sol 6:11; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-43.htm">1 Kings 20:43</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-7.htm">Esther 7:7</a>) - into his garden, to the fragrant beds, there to feed in his garden and gather lilies (cf. Old Germ. "to collect rsen"); he is fond of gardens and flowers. Shulamith expresses this in her shepherd-dialect, as when Jesus says of His Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>), "He is the husbandman." Flowerbeds are the feeding place (vid., regarding &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; under Sol 2:16) of her beloved. Solomon certainly took great delight in gardens and parks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>. But this historical fact is here idealized; the natural flora which Solomon delighted in with intelligent interest presents itself as a figure of a higher Loveliness which was therein as it were typically manifest (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>, where the "Lamb," "feeding," and "fountains of water," are applied as anagogics, i.e., heavenward-pointing types). Otherwise it is not to be comprehended why it is lilies that are named. Even if it were supposed to be implied that lilies were Solomon's favourite flowers, we must assume that his taste was determined by something more than by form and colour. The words of Shulamith give us to understand that the inclination and the favourite resort of her friend corresponded to his nature, which is altogether thoughtfulness and depth of feeling (cf. under <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-5.htm">Psalm 92:5</a>, the reference to Dante: the beautiful women who gather flowers representing the paradisaical life); lilies, the emblems of unapproachable grandeur, purity inspiring reverence, high elevation above that which is common, bloom there wherever the lily-like one wanders, whom the lily of the valley calls her own.
