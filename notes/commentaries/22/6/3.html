Those who would find Christ, must attend him in his ordinances, the word, sacraments, and prayer. When Christ comes to his church, it is to entertain his friends. And to take believers to himself: he picks the lilies one by one; and at the great day he will send forth his angels to gather all his lilies, that he may be for ever admired in them. The death of a believer is not more than the owner of a garden plucking a favourite flower; and He will preserve it from withering, yea, cause it to flourish for ever, with increasing beauty. If our own hearts can witness for us that we are Christ's, question not his being ours, for the covenant never breaks on his side. It is the comfort of the church, that he feeds among the lilies, that he takes delight in his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The question put by the chorus, and the answer it receives from the bride, show that the loss and seeking are not to be taken too seriously. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/songs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. In speaking of Jesus Christ to others, she regains her own assurance. Literally, "I am for my beloved &#8230; for me." Reverse order from So 2:16. She now, after the season of darkness, grounds her convictions on His love towards her, more than on hers towards Him (De 33:3). There, it was the young believer concluding that she was His, from the sensible assurance that He was hers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/songs/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/songs/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine,.... Expressive of interest in Christ, and union to him, and of her faith therein; which still continued, notwithstanding her unbecoming behavior toward Christ, and her many infirmities, Sol 5:2. Aben Ezra connects the words with the preceding, "my beloved is gone", &amp;c. but though he is, and I am left alone, I know I am his, and he is mine; which throws a beauty upon the words, and declares the excellency and strength of her faith; for herein lies the glory and excellency of faith, to believe in an unseen Christ: though it may be the Shechinah was with her, as the Targum has it; or Christ had now appeared to her, and was found by her, and therefore, like Thomas, says, "my Lord and my God"; <p>he feedeth among the lilies; See Gill on Sol 2:16. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/songs/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/songs/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. Here she expresses her jealous feeling. They are not to search for him with her. That is her business alone, they have no claim to be even thus interested in him. She fears she has overshot the mark in the praises she has uttered concerning her beloved. She has held him up for their admiration, but seeing how great it is, she snatches him back as it were, lest she should lose him. ‘I alone am his and he is mine, he who is feeding his flock among the lilies.’<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13a His cheeks like a bed of sweet herbs,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towers of spicy plants.<p>A flower-bed is called &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1490;, to be oblique, inclined. His cheeks are like such a soft raised bed, and the impression their appearance makes is like the fragrance which flows from such a bed planted with sweet-scented flowers. Migedaloth are the tower-like or pyramidal mounds, and merkahhim are the plants used in spicery. The point of comparison here is thus the soft elevation; perhaps with reference to the mingling of colours, but the word chosen (merkahhim) rather refers to the lovely, attractive, heart-refreshing character of the impression. The Venet., keeping close to the existing text: &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (thus not a&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;] according to Gebhardt's just conjecture). But is the punctuation here correct? The sing. &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1490;&#1514; is explained from this, that the bed is presented as sloping from its height downward on two parallel sides; but the height would then be the nose dividing the face, and the plur. would thus be more suitable; and the lxx, Symm., and other ancient translators have, in fact, read &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1490;&#1514;. But still less is the phrase migdeloth merkahhim to be comprehended; for a tower, however diminutive it may be, it not a proper figure for a soft elevation, nor even a graduated flowery walk, or a terraced flowery hill, - a tower always presents, however round one may conceive it, too much the idea of a natural chubbiness, or of a diseased tumour. Therefore the expression used by the lxx, &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;, i.e., &#1502;&#1512;&#1511;' &#1502;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, commends itself. Thus also Jerome: sicut areolae aromatum consitae a pigmentariis, and the Targ. (which refers &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; allegorically to the &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; of the law, and merkahhim to the refinements of the Halacha): "like the rows of a garden of aromatic plants which produce (gignentes) deep, penetrating sciences, even as a (magnificent) garden, aromatic plants." Since we read &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1490;&#1514;, we do not refer migadloth, as Hitzig, who retains &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1490;&#1514;, to the cheeks, although their name, like that of the other members (e.g., the ear, hand, foot), may be fem. (Bttch. 649), but to the beds of spices; but in this carrying forward of the figure we find, as he does, a reference to the beard and down on the cheeks. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; is used of suffering the hair to grow, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>, as well as of cultivating plants; and it is a similar figure when Pindar, Nem. v. 11, compares the milk-hair of a young man to the fine woolly down of the expanding vine-leaves (vid., Passow). In merkahhim there scarcely lies anything further than that this flos juventae on the blooming cheeks gives the impression of the young shoots of aromatic plants; at all events, the merkahhim, even although we refer this feature in the figure to the fragrance of the unguents on the beard, are not the perfumes themselves, to which megadloth is not appropriate, but fragrant plants, so that in the first instance the growth of the beard is in view with the impression of its natural beauty.<p>13b His lips lilies,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropping with liquid myrrh.<p>Lilies, viz., red lilies (vid., under Sol 2:1), unless the point of comparison is merely loveliness associated with dignity. She thinks of the lips as speaking. All that comes forth from them, the breath in itself, and the breath formed into words, is &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;, most precious myrrh, viz., such as of itself wells forth from the bark of the balsamodendron. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, the running over of the eyes (cf. myrrha in lacrimis, the most highly esteemed sort, as distinguished from myrrha in granis), with which Dillmann combines the Aethiop. name for myrrh, karbe&#770; (vid., under Song _Num 5:5). </body></html>
