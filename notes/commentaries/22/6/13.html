But not in the retirement of the idle, the self-indulgent, or the trifler. When the Christian is released from the discharge of his duties in life, the world has no attractions for him. His prayer is, that all things belonging to the Spirit may live and grow within him, and around him. Such are the interesting cares and employments of him whom the world wrongly deems unhappy, and lost to his true interests. In humility and self-abasement, the humble Christian would turn away from the sight of all; but the Lord delights to honour him. Chiefly, however, may the reference be to the ministering angels who shall be sent for the soul of the Christian. Their approach may startle, but the departing soul shall find the Lord its strength and its portion for ever. The church is called the Shulamite: the word signifies perfection and peace; not in herself, but in Christ, in whom she is complete, through his righteousness; and has peace, which he made for her through his blood, and gives unto her by his Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Return, return - About to withdraw, the bride is recalled by the chorus, desiring yet a little longer to contemplate a grace and beauty which has won all hearts.<p>Shulamite - Probably the same as "Shunamite," i. e., a native of the town or district of Shunem, situated in the territory of Issachar <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>, on the slopes of the Little Hermon, overlooking the plain of Jezreel.

Entreaty of the daughters of Jerusalem to her, in her chariot-like flight from them (compare 2Ki 2:12; 2Sa 19:14).<p>Shulamite&#8212;new name applied to her now for the first time. Feminine of Solomon, Prince of Peace; His bride, daughter of peace, accepting and proclaiming it (Isa 52:7; Joh 14:27; Ro 5:1; Eph 2:17). Historically, this name answers to the time when, not without a divine design in it, the young Church met in Solomon's porch (Ac 3:11; 5:12). The entreaty, "Return, O Shulamite," answers to the people's desire to keep Peter and John, after the lame man was healed, when they were about to enter the temple. Their reply attributing the glory not to themselves, but to Jesus Christ, answers to the bride's reply here, "What will ye see" in me? "As it were," &c. She accepts the name Shulamite, as truly describing her. But adds, that though "one" (So 6:9), she is nevertheless "two." Her glories are her Lord's, beaming through her (Eph 5:31, 32). The two armies are the family of Jesus Christ in heaven, and that on earth, joined and one with Him; the one militant, the other triumphant. Or Jesus Christ and His ministering angels are one army, the Church the other, both being one (Joh 17:21, 22). Allusion is made to Mahanaim (meaning two hosts), the scene of Jacob's victorious conflict by prayer (Ge 32:2, 9, 22-30). Though she is peace, yet she has warfare here, between flesh and spirit within and foes without; her strength, as Jacob's at Mahanaim, is Jesus Christ and His host enlisted on her side by prayer; whence she obtains those graces which raise the admiration of the daughters of Jerusalem.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/songs/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Return:</span> Christ recalls his spouse, who as when Christ was gone she pursued after him, so now when Christ was coming or come to her, she was ready to wander and go astray from him, according to the common and corrupt disposition and custom of mankind; and therefore he seeks to stop or to reclaim her, and to oblige her to return to her first love, and to repent more thoroughly than she had yet done. <span class="ital">Return</span>: this word is here repeated four times, to signify both Christ’s passionate love to her, and earnest desire of her return, and her backwardness to it, which made so many calls necessary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shulamite:</span> this title signifies either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

By whom the church is meant, so called from her being the spouse of Christ, the true Solomon; it being common for the wife to have the same name with her husband; thus, with the Romans, if the man's name was Caius, the woman's name was Caia: is the name of Christ Solomon? the church's name is Shulamite; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>. The word from which this is derived signifies both perfection and peace; and the church may be called the Shulamite from her perfection, not in herself, but in Christ, in whom she is complete, and perfectly comely through his righteousness; and is also denominated from the peace which she has from Christ, and he has made for her through his blood, and he gives unto her by his Spirit; and from what she does or should enjoy in her members, and from what she will be possessed of to all eternity. Now the church, the Shulamite, is very importunately desired by the daughters of Jerusalem to return; which is said no less than four times, which shows how vehemently desirous they were of her company: and perceiving she was about to go from them, most earnestly press her to return, or to "turn" (b); to turn herself, that her beauty and comeliness might be more plainly seen; for this is the end proposed by them, <p>that we may look upon thee; that they might still have more opportunity of viewing her, and more narrowly to examine her beauty, for which she was so much commended; and that they might enjoy more of her company and conversation, which had been, and they might hope would be, more useful and instructive to them. A question upon this follows, <p>What will ye see in the Shulamite? which question is put, either by the daughters among themselves; some wishing for her return, and others asking what they expected to see in her, should she return: or rather it is put by the church herself; who asks the daughters, what they expected to see in her, a poor, mean, unworthy creature, not fit to be looked on, having nothing extraordinary, nor indeed valuable or of worth, in seeing of her? Which question is thus answered, <p>As it were the company of two armies: either by the daughters, declaring what they expected to see in the church; either such a glorious and joyful meeting between Christ and her, as is often between great persons, attended with singing and dancing; so the word for company is rendered by the Septuagint (c) "choroi", a "company" of those that dance and sing; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a>; or such an appearance as an army makes at the reception of their prince, when it is divided into two bands, for the sake of greater honour and majesty. Or rather this answer is returned by the church herself; signifying that nothing was to be seen in her but two armies, flesh and Spirit, sin and grace, continually warring against each other; which surely, she thought, could be no desirable and pleasing sight to them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a>. <p>(b)  Sept.

It is not clear at once who the speaker in this verse is. There must be either more than one person concerned in it, or quotation, for there is an evident interchange of question and answer. Probably we should, with Oettli, assign the verse to the bride. She is rehearsing all that happened on the eventful day when Solomon came upon her. When she found herself among the royal chariots she turned to flee, and the ladies called to her to return. Hearing the call, she stopped to ask, ‘Why would ye gaze at the Shulammite as upon the dance of Mahanaim’? See below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">O <span class="bld">Shulammite</span></span>] This name for the bride occurs here only, and cannot be a proper name, otherwise even in the vocative there would be no article, as there is here. It must, therefore, mean ‘maiden of Shulam’ (cp. the Shunammite, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-3.htm" title="So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.">1 Kings 1:3</a>). Not knowing her name, the courtiers call her by the name of the village near which they were when they saw her. This village was doubtless Shunem, in the plains of Esdraelon, which belonged to the tribe of Issachar. It has been identified by Robinson (<span class="ital">Researches</span>, 11. 325) with the modern <span class="ital">Solam</span>, a village in the neighbourhood of Jezreel on the southern slope of the east end of Little Hermon, as Nain is upon its northern slope. From the fact that the modern name has <span class="ital">l</span> for <span class="ital">n</span>, it is probable that Shulam is a later form than Shunem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that we may look upon thee</span>] The Heb. verb with the construction it has here means generally ‘to look upon with pleasure,’ but also simply ‘to gaze at’ (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-13.htm" title="You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save you from these things that shall come on you.">Isaiah 47:13</a>). In the first clause here we have the first meaning, in the second the other according to many expositors. In this latter case, “What will ye see” should be <span class="ital">What would ye gaze at</span>? But it is better to keep the same meaning and translate, <span class="bld">Why would ye look upon the Shulammite?</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">As it were the company of two armies</span>] The R.V. gives <span class="bld">As upon the dance of Mahanaim?</span> and probably this is the right translation. As she endeavours to escape, the Shulammite asks, would they stare at her as at a public spectacle. Some have thought that there is a reference here to the angel hosts from which Jacob is said to have named the place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm" title="And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.">Genesis 32:2</a>). But there is no hint that there was anything resembling a dance in their movements. The probability, therefore, is that after Jacob’s vision Mahanaim became a holy place, if it was not one before, and that God was there praised in the dance (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-21.htm" title="And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come you out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.">Jdg 21:21</a>), and that these dances had become famous either for their gracefulness or for their splendour. That Mahanaim was a place of importance, whether for political or for religious reasons or for both, is clear from the fact that Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, set up his kingdom there, and that David fled thither when he was driven away from Jerusalem by Absalom. It was also a Levitical city. It lay to the N. of the Jabbok not far from the valley of the Jordan, on the heights above that valley. Its exact site is unknown, as it can hardly have been <span class="ital">el-Michne</span> as Robinson supposes, for that is too far both from the Jabbok and from the Jordan. That places were famed for dances is shewn by the name <span class="ital">Abel-Mecholah</span> = ‘Dance meadow.’ The R.V. has in the margin, “a dance of two companies.” This might be supposed to be a dance specially worth seeing. Such a dance is described by Wetzstein, who says that in the Gof, or as Palgrave writes it, the Djowf, a region of N. Arabia, there is a variety of the dance called <span class="ital">Sahqa</span>, which is danced by two companies of men standing opposite each other, as in our country dances. But these Bedouin and Arab customs have no known connexion with the people west of the Jordan. Budde would change the dual into the plural and would read <span class="ital">machanim</span> and translate “as upon a camp dance,” i.e. ‘a sword dance,’ which forms part of the marriage customs Wetzstein describes. But a <span class="ital">camp</span> dance would be a very odd name for the <span class="ital">sword</span> dance, and though it is true that the place-name Mahanaim does not occur with the article, the article here may quite well define the <span class="ital">dance</span>, not <span class="ital">Mahanaim</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13a.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee.</span> Shulem is the same as Shunem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-3.htm">1 Kings 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>). Shulamite will, therefore, mean "lady of Shulem." It is the first occurrence of the name. It cannot be a pure proper name, says Delitzsch, because the article is attached to it. It is a name of descent. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "she who is from Shunem." Abishag was exceedingly beautiful, and she came from the same district. It is the country in the tribe of Issachar, near to little Hermon, to the southeast of Carmel and south of Nain, southeast of Nazareth, southwest of Tabor. It is found at present under the name <span class="accented">Sawlam</span>, not far from the great plain of Jiszeal (now <span class="accented">Zer'in</span>), "which forms a convenient way of communication between Jordan and the seacoast, but is yet so hidden in the mountain range that the Talmud is silent concerning this Sulem, as it is concerning Nazareth." It is impossible to resist the impression of the fact that this part of Galilee so closely associated with our Lord and his ministry should be the native place of the bride. Delitzsch thinks that the Shulamite is on her way from the garden to the palace. That the words are addressed to her by the admiring ladies can scarcely be disputed; hence the "we" of the address. "The fourfold 'come back' (or, 'turn') entreats her earnestly, yea, with team, to return thither (that is, to the garden) with them once more, and for this purpose, that they might find delight in looking upon her." But Delitzsch is scarcely right in thinking that the garden of nuts to which the bride referred is the garden of the palace. She is, perhaps, turning to leave the company of ladies, Solomon himself beingamong them, as though she would escape from their gaze, which is too much for her in her simplicity, and the ladies, seeing her intention to leave them, call her back. Another view is that the word "return" is for "turn round;" that is, "Let us see thee dance, that we may admire the beauty of thy form and movements." This would explain the appropriateness of the bride's reply in the latter haft of the verse. Moreover, the fourfold appeal is scarcely suitable if the bride was only slightly indicating her intention to leave. She would surely not leave hastily, seeing that Solomon is present. The request is not that she may remain, but that they may look upon her. It would be quite fitting in the mouth of lady companions. The whole  is doubtless a poetic artifice, as before in the case of the dream, for the purpose of introducing the lovely description of her personal attractions. Plainly she is described as dancing or as if dancing. Delitzsch, however, thinks that the dance is only referred to by the ladies as a comparison; but in that case he certainly leaves unexplained the peculiarity of the description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-1.htm">Song of Solomon 7:1-5</a>, which most naturally is a description of a dancing figure. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why will ye look upon the Shulamite as upon the dance of Mahanaim?</span> The Shulamite, in her perfect modesty and humility, not knowing how beautiful she really is, asks why it is that they wish still to gaze upon her, like those that gaze at the dance of Mahanaim, or why they wish her to dance. But at the same moment, with the complaisance of perfect amiability, begins to move - always a pleasure to a lovely maiden - thus filling them with admiration. Mahanaim came in later times to mean "angels," or the "heavenly host" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>), but here it is generally thought to be the name of a dance, perhaps one in which the inhabitants of Mahanaim excelled, or one in which angels or hosts were thought to engage. The old translators, the Syriac, Jerome, and the Venetian, render, "the dances of the camps" (<span class="accented">choros castrarum</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), possibly a war dance or parade. The word, however, is in the dual. Delitzsch thinks the meaning is a dance as of angels, "only a step beyond the responsive song of the seraphim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>.). Of course, there can be no objection to the association of angels with the bride, but there is no necessity for it. The word would be, no doubt, familiarly known in the age of Solomon. The sacred dances wore often referred to in Scripture. and there would be nothing degrading to the dignity of the bride in dancing before the ladies and her own husband. "After throwing aside her upper garment, so that she had only the light clothing of a shepherdess or vine dresser, Shulamith danced to and fro before the daughters of Jerusalem, and displayed all her attractions before them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>5a Turn away thine eyes from me,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For overpoweringly they assail me.<p>Dpke translates, ferocire me faciunt; Hengst.: they make me proud; but although &#1492;&#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1489;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/138-3.htm">Psalm 138:3</a>, may be thus used, yet that would be an effect produced by the eyes, which certainly would suggest the very opposite of the request to turn them away. The verb &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; means to be impetuous, and to press impetuously against any one; the Hiph. is the intens. of this trans. signification of the Kal: to press overpoweringly against one, to infuse terror, terrorem incutere. The lxx translates it by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, which is also used of the effect of terror ("to make to start up"), and the Syr. by afred, to put to flight, because arheb signifies to put in fear, as also arhab  equals  khawwaf, terrefacere; but here the meaning of the verb corresponds more with the sense of Arab. r''b, to be placed in the state of ro'b, i.e., of paralyzing terror. If she directed her large, clear, penetrating eyes to him, he must sink his own: their glance is unbearable by him. This peculiar form the praise of her eyes here assume; but then the description proceeds as at Sol 4:1, Sol 2:3. The words used there in praise of her hair, her teeth, and her cheeks, are here repeated.<p>5b Thy hair is like a flock of goats<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which repose downwards on Giliad.<p>6 Thy teeth like a flock of lambs<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Which come up from the washing,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All of them bearing twins,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And a bereaved one is not among them.<p>7 Like a piece of pomegranate thy temples<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind thy veil.<p>The repetition is literal, but yet not without change in the expression, - there, &#1490;&#1500; &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;, here, &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;; there, &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509;, tonsarum, here, &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;, agnarum (Symm., Venet. &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;); for &#1512;&#1495;&#1500;, in its proper signification, is like the Arab. rachil, richl, richleh, the female lamb, and particularly the ewe. Hitzig imagines that Solomon here repeats to Shulamith what he had said to another donna chosen for marriage, and that the flattery becomes insipid by repetition to Shulamith, as well as also to the reader. But the romance which he finds in the Song is not this itself, but his own palimpsest, in the style of Lucian's transformed ass. The repetition has a morally better reason, and not one so subtle. Shulamith appears to Solomon yet more beautiful than on the day when she was brought to him as his bride. His love is still the same, unchanged; and this both she and the reader or hearer must conclude from these words of praise, repeated now as they were then. There is no one among the ladies of the court whom he prefers to her, - these must themselves acknowledge her superiority. </body></html>
