The hole is the aperture made in the door above the lock for the insertion of the hand with the key. The ancient lock was probably like the one in use in Palestine now. It consists of a <span class= "ital">hollow </span>bolt or bar, which passes through a staple fixed to the door and into the door-post. In the staple are a number of movable pins, which drop into corresponding holes in the bolt when it is pushed home, and the door is then locked. To unlock it, the key is slid into the hollow bolt, and the movable pins pushed back by other pins in it, corresponding in size and form, which fill up the holes, and so enable the bolt to be withdrawn. It is said that, in lieu of a proper key, the arm can be inserted into the hollow bolt and the pins be pushed up by the hand, if provided with some soft material, as lard or wax, to fill up the holes, and keep the pins from falling back again till the bolt is withdrawn. This offers one explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-5.htm" title="I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, on the handles of the lock.">Song of Solomon 5:5</a>. Coming to the door and having no key, the lover is supposed to make use of some myrrh, brought as a present, in trying to open the door, and, not succeeding, to go away. The <span class= "ital">sweet smelling </span>(Marg., <span class= "ital">passing, </span>or <span class= "ital">running about</span>) is the myrrh that drops from the tree naturally, before any incision is made in the bark, and is considered specially fine.

We ought to notice our spiritual slumbers and distempers. Christ knocks to awaken us, knocks by his word and Spirit, knocks by afflictions and by our consciences; thus, Re 3:20. When we are unmindful of Christ, still he thinks of us. Christ's love to us should engage ours to him, even in the most self-denying instances; and we only can be gainers by it. Careless souls put slights on Jesus Christ. Another could not be sent to open the door. Christ calls to us, but we have no mind, or pretend we have no strength, or we have no time, and think we may be excused. Making excuses is making light of Christ. Those put contempt upon Christ, who cannot find in their hearts to bear a cold blast, or to leave a warm bed for him. See the powerful influences of Divine grace.  He put in his hand to unbolt the door, as one weary of waiting. This betokens a work of the Spirit upon the soul. The believer's rising above self-indulgence, seeking by prayer for the consolations of Christ, and to remove every hinderance to communion with him; these actings of the soul are represented by the hands dropping sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the locks. But the Beloved was gone! By absenting himself, Christ will teach his people to value his gracious visits more highly. Observe, the soul still calls Christ her Beloved. Every desertion is not despair. Lord, I believe, though I must say, Lord, help my unbelief. His words melted me, yet, wretch that I was, I made excuses. The smothering and stifling of convictions will be very bitter to think of, when God opens our eyes. The soul went in pursuit of him; not only prayed, but used means, sought him in the ways wherein he used to be found. The watchmen wounded me. Some refer it to those who misapply the word to awakened consciences. The charge to the daughters of Jerusalem, seems to mean the distressed believer's desire of the prayers of the feeblest Christian. Awakened souls are more sensible of Christ's withdrawings than of any other trouble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Put in his hand - Through (literally "from") the hole (of the lock), in order to raise the pins by which the bolt was fastened. The Oriental lock is a hollow piece of wood attached to the doorpost, into which a sliding-bolt is made to run. As soon as the bolt has been driven home a number of pins drop into holes prepared in it for their reception. To raise these pins, and so enable the bolt to be withdrawn, is to unfasten the lock. This is commonly done by means of the key (literally "opener"), but may often be accomplished by the fingers if dipped in paste or some other adhesive substance. For such a purpose the beloved inserts his fingers here anointed with the costly unguent, which will presently distil on those of the bride when she rises to open to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/songs/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. A key in the East is usually a piece of wood with pegs in it corresponding to small holes in a wooden bolt within, and is put through a hole in the door, and thus draws the bolt.

"If I only knew here," says Rocke, "how to disclose the meaning, certainly all these flowers and fruits, in the figurative language of the Orient, in the flower-language of love, had their beautiful interpretation." In the old German poetry, also, the phrase bluomen brechen to break flowers was equivalent to: to enjoy love; the flowers and fruits named are figures of all that the amata offers to the amator. Most of the plants here named are exotics; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1505; (heaping around, circumvallation, enclosing) is a garden or park, especially with foreign ornamental and fragrant plants - an old Persian word, the explanation of which, after Spiegel, first given in our exposition of the Song, 1851 (from pairi  equals  &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;, and de&#770;z, R. diz, a heap), has now become common property (Justi's Handb. der Zendsprache, p. 180). &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; (from &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;, which corresponds to The Arab. mejd, praise, honour, excellence; vid., Volck under <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>) are fructus laudum, or lautitiarum, excellent precious fruits, which in the more modern language are simply called &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (Shabbath 127b, &#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, all kinds of fine fruits); cf.

For &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, Grtz reads &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, roses, because the poet would not have named nard twice. The conjecture is beautiful, but for us, who believe the poem to be Solomonic, is inconsistent with the history of roses (vid., under Sol 2:1), and also unnecessary. The description moves forward by steps rhythmically.<p>&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1499;&#1501; is the crocus stativus, the genuine Indian safran, the dried flower-eyes of which yield the safran used as a colour, as an aromatic, and also as medicine; safran is an Arab. word, and means yellow root and yellow colouring matter. The name &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1499;&#1501;, Pers. karkam, Arab. karkum, is radically Indian, Sanscr. kunkuma. &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, a reed (from &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, R. qn, to rise up, viewed intrans.), <p>(Note: In this general sense of "reed" (Syn. arundo) the word is also found in the Gr. and Lat.: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), reed-mats, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, a wicker basket, canna, canistrum, without any reference to an Indo-Germ. verbal stem, and without acquiring the specific signification of an aromatic plant.)<p>viz., sweet reed, acorus calamus, which with us now grows wild in marshes, but is indigenous to the Orient.<p>&#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1503; is the laurus cinnamomum, a tree indigenous to the east coast of Africa and Ceylon, and found later also on the Antilles.

(e.g., in the 12th book of Pliny) cinnamomum and cinnamum, are interchanged, from &#1511;&#1504;&#1501;, probably a secondary formation from &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, whence &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;), to which also Syr. qenu&#770;ma&#772;', &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and the Talm.-Targ. &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1511;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, an oath (cf. &#1511;&#1497;&#1501;), go back, so that thus the name which was brought to the west by the Phoenicians denoted not the tree, but the reed-like form of the rolled dried bark. As "nards" refer to varieties of the nard, perhaps to the Indian and the Jamanic spoken of by Strabo and others, so "all kinds of incense trees" refers definitely to Indo-Arab. varieties of the incense tree and its fragrant resin; it has its name fro the white and transparent seeds of this its resin (cf. Arab. luba&#770;n, incense and benzoin, the resin of the storax tree, &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;); the Greek &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Lat. thus, frankincense, from &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;), is a word derived from the Pheonicians.<p>&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (which already in a remarkable way was used by Balaam, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>, elsewhere only since the time of Solomon) is the Semitized old Indian name of the aloe, agaru or aguru; that which is aromatic is the wood of the aloe-tree (aloxylon agallochum), particularly its dried root (agallochum or lignum alos, &#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;, according to which the Targ. here: &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, after the phrase in Aruch) mouldered in the earth, which chiefly came from farther India.<p>(Note: Vid., Lassen's Ind. Alterthumsk. I 334f. Furrer, in Schenkel's Bib. Lex., understands &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; of the liliaceae, indigenous to Palestine as to Arabia, which is also called alo. But the drastic purgative which the succulent leaves of this plant yield is not aromatic, and the verb &#1488;&#1495;&#1500; "to glisten," whence he seeks to derive the name of this aloe, is not proved. Cf. besides, the Petersburg Lex. under aguru ("not difficult"), according to which is this name of the amyris agallocha, and the aquilaria agallocha, but of no liliaceae. The name Adlerholz ("eagle-wood") rests on a misunderstanding of the name of the Agila tree. It is called "Paradiesholz," because it must have been one of the paradise trees (vid., Bereshith rabba under <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>). Dioskorides says of this wood: &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; the Song therefore places it along with myrrh and frankincense. That which is common to the lily-aloe and the wood-aloe, is the bitter taste of the juice of the former and of the resinous wood of the latter. The Arab. name of the aloe, s&#803;abir, is also given to the lily-aloe. The proverbs: amarru min es&#803;-s&#803;abir, bitterer than the aloe, and es-sabr sabir, patience is the aloe, refer to the aloe-juice.)<p>continued...</body></html>
