I am no longer of a low and despicable stature, nor unfit for his love: but from this time forth I shall be acceptable unto him, and find such favour with him, as to enjoy all the happiness which he imparts to those that are most dear unto him.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:8-12 The church pleads for the Gentiles, who then had not the word of God, nor the means of grace. Those who are brought to Christ themselves, should contrive what they may do to help others to him. Babes in Christ are always seen among Christians, and the welfare of their weak brethren is an object of continual prayer with the stronger believers. If the beginning of this work were likened to a wall built upon Him the precious Foundation and Corner-stone, then the Gentile church would become as a palace for the great King, built of solid silver. If the first preaching of the gospel were as the making a door through the wall of partition, that door should be lasting, as cased with boards of durable cedar. She shall be carefully and effectually protected, enclosed so as to receive no damage. The church is full of care for those yet uncalled. Christ says, I will do all that is necessary to be done for them. See with what satisfaction we should look back upon the times and seasons, when we were in his eyes as those that find favour. Our hearts are our vineyards, which we must keep with all diligence. To Christ, and to his praise, all our fruits must be dedicated. All that work for Christ, work for themselves, and shall be unspeakable gainers by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bride herself replies with the pride of innocence and virtue already crowned.

The Gentile Church's joy at its free admission to gospel privileges (Ac 15:30, 31).

The words of the little sister, or Gentile church; either wishing she was what was supposed, and desiring to be in a well settled state, "O that I was a wall!" or as asserting (d) that she was in such a state, well walled; God was a wall of fire about her; salvation was appointed as walls and bulwarks to her; she was one of the two walls Christ was a cornerstone unto, and cemented together; and was a wall built up of lively stones, of true believers, built on Christ, the foundation; and established in the doctrine of grace; and constant and immovable in her love to Christ; <p>and my breasts like towers; round, plump, and high; signifying that she was now marriageable; and the time of her being presented as a chaste virgin to Christ, and of her open espousals to him, was now come: of ministers of the word, of the Scriptures, and of the ordinances of the Gospel, as signified by breasts; see Gill on Sol 4:5; which may be said to be "like towers": ministers of the word, because set for the defence of the Gospel; the Scriptures, because an armoury from whence saints are supplied with armour, to repel Satan's temptations, refute errors, and defend truth; and the ordinances of the Gospel, because they stand firm and immovable against all the efforts of men to subvert and abolish them; and these are peculiar to the Gentile church, under the Gospel dispensation; <p>then was I in his eyes as one that found favour; from the time that the Gentile church became a wall, firmly built on Christ, and was formed into a church state, and had a settled ministry and Gospel ordinances, she became acceptable to Christ, and was admitted to near communion with him; and not only her person, but her services, met with a favourable acceptance from him; and these privileges and blessings were the fruit of his love, layout, and good will, he bore to her; which before was secret and hidden, but now her breasts being fashioned, her time was a time of love, of the open love of Christ to her, and of her espousals to him: and when, as the words may be rendered, she was "as one that found peace" (e); peace being made by the blood of Christ, and the partition wall broken down between Jew and Gentile, and they peaceably joined together in a Gospel church state; and when she enjoyed inward peace and tranquillity of mind, which is found in Christ, the word and ordinances; even all kind of prosperity, which peace, with the Hebrews, includes; every spiritual blessing, as reconciliation, justification, pardon, adoption, and eternal life, which are all the fruits and effects of divine favour, good will, grace, and love. <p>(d) "Hoc est, nolite dubitare ultrum murus sum", Ambros.

The bride here proudly claims that she has proved herself the sufficient guardian of her own honour. All her brothers’ anxieties were idle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">then was I in his eyes</span>, &c.] The most obvious explanation of this phrase is that the Shulammite explains her return in safety by saying, ‘I have been, throughout, a wall and my breasts like towers, then was I in his (my oppressor’s) eyes <span class="ital">as one finding peace</span>’: that is to say, he dealt with her as a king deals with a city which he cannot capture, he made peace. This fits in admirably with the view that the bride had been besieged by Solomon’s attentions, and that she had resisted them. It also accounts for the mention of Solomon again in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/8-11.htm" title="Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver....">Song of Solomon 8:11-12</a></span>. If ‘his’ be taken to refer to the lover, then the meaning would be: ‘When I had shewn my chastity and constancy, then I was in his eyes as one finding peace,’ i.e. I was favoured in my lover’s eyes. Budde, Siegfried, and Delitzsch can find no satisfactory explanation of this clause on their theories of the book.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof: then was I in his eyes as one that found peace. Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to brings a thousand pieces of silver. My vineyard, which is mine, is</span>  <span class="cmt_word">before me: thou, O Solomon, shalt have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</span> The meaning seems to be affectionate approval of the method just described. Solomon says, "If the young sister be, worthy of love, she shall receive more and more of defence and honour; she shall be all that I can make her." The bride takes up this thought. "So it is with me, and, in the spirit of thankful acknowledgments and praise, I will respond to all the favour of the king. King Solomon has loved me, and now I am rising higher and becoming more and more glorious because of his love." The typical reference can scarcely be missed. The Church, the bride of the Lamb, shines only in the light of him whose favour is life, and whose loving kindness is better than life. The comparison to a city with the walls and towers, while it would seem a little far fetched in a love song, is quite in place if the typical intention was in the mind of the writer. He was thinking of the city of God, "beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth." "One that findeth peace" is the same as "one that findeth favour," that is, one who is the object of his affection. There are several references which confirm this, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-10.htm">Psalm 41:10</a>. The word "peace" (<span class="accented">shalom</span>) is in all probability purposely chosen in this case as a kind of play on the name <span class="accented">Solomon</span>, which appears immediately afterwards. "The king of peace delights in me because I am peace in his eyes." The Church is after the image of the King. His likeness in her makes her beautiful. Men take knowledge of Christians that they have been with Jesus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>). It is scarcely necessary to point out that this language of the bride is entirely against the shepherd theory. She could not have talked of finding peace in his eyes if she was torn from her true lover. The bride then goes on to express her devotedness to the king and her desire to bring forth abundance for him. She uses as an example, which perhaps was typical in her time and country, some remarkably fruitful vineyard of the king's. She will, in like manner, realize all his highest wishes. All that she has shall be his. The name Baal-hamon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. Judith 8:3), designates probably a place near to Sunem, somewhere to the north, on the further side of the Plain of Jezreeh The produce of the vineyard must have been very large, as every keeper was to bring in for himself a thousand shekels of silver. It is not stated how many keepers there were, but the word which is employed is not "servants," but "watchers, or overseers." A vineyard was divided into portions, with a certain definite prescribed number of vines in each portion. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-23.htm">Isaiah 7:23</a> we read, "And it shall come to pass in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings shall even be for briers and thorns." Now, a thousand silverlings was one shekel, so that if this passage can be taken as throwing light on what the bride says, it would imply that, instead of one shekel forevery thousand vines, every keeper brought a thousand shekels. That would seem impossible, so that the parallel can scarcely be strict. Perhaps the largeness of the vineyard is referred to, and each of the keepers would have many thousands of vines under his inspection. The general meaning, however, is not obscure. The vineyard was a celebrated one, and was taken as a typical instance of fertility and abundance. When the bride speaks of her vineyard which is before her, there may be an allusion to her previous manner of life as a rustic maiden employed in the vineyards, and to her own position as a keeper or as one of the family. But this is not intended to be prominently expressed. The whole spirit of the poem justifies the view that she is speaking of her person. She invited Solomon to rejoice in the beauty and fragrance of her garden, to pluck the fruits, to revel in the delights. Everything that is pleasant and lovely is before him (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>). <span class="accented">Before me</span>; that is, in my power is all this delight, and my desire is to my husband; all that I have is his. Like the far-famed keepers of Baal-hamon, I will give the king a thousand shekels, that is, the utmost that the vineyard can produce, and "those that keep the fruit thereof" shall have two hundred - perhaps meaning a hundred each, that is a tenth, which was the ancient tithe due to the priests. It may be, however, that a double tithe is intended. The king shall be satisfied, and all those who labour for the king shall be more than ever rewarded. If we take such words as typical, they point to a state of things in the history of the kingdom of God when the spiritual and the temporal shall be perfectly adjusted. The keepers of the vineyard have often made sad havoc of the vineyard itself because of their greedy discontent. The fruits which have been yielded by the Church have fallen very far short. The husbandmen have ill treated the Lord's servants. But all the judgments which have been poured out both upon ancient Jews and upon the corrupt Christendom of later times have been directed to one end, to make the vineyard of the Lord more fruitful, to remove the things which are offensive in his sight, to satisfy him whose soul travailed for his people; for herein is the Father glorified in the Son, when them  who bear the name of the Beloved "bear much fruit." Then the keepers of the vineyard will themselves rejoice, not that they reap a larger harvest of this world's good, not "for filthy lucre's sake," but because their hearts are one with his whose vineyard they keep, and to see the fruit abound is to fill them with joy. Surely we shall recognize in such language an anticipation of the many allusions which are found both in the prophets and psalms and in the discourses of our Lord himself. "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Resigning herself now dreamily to the idea that Solomon is her brother, whom she may freely and openly kiss, and her teacher besides, with whom she may sit in confidential intercourse under her mother's eye, she feels herself as if closely embraced by him, and calls from a distance to the daughters of Jerusalem not to disturb this her happy enjoyment:<p>3 His left hand is under my head,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And his right doth embrace me:<p>4 I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That ye awake not and disturb not love<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Till she please!<p>Instead of   &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514; &#1500;, "underneath," there is here, as usual, &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514; (cf. Sol 8:5). Instead of &#1488;&#1501; ... &#1493;&#1488;&#1501; in the adjuration, there is here the equivalent &#1502;&#1492; ... &#1493;&#1502;&#1492;; the interrogative &#1502;&#1492;, which in the Arab. ma becomes negat., appears here, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>, on the way toward this change of meaning. The per capreas vel per cervas agri is wanting, perhaps because the natural side of love is here broken, and the &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; strives up into &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;. The daughters of Jerusalem must not break in upon this holy love-festival, but leave it to its own course. </body></html>
