The Christian church was raised from a low, desolate condition, by the grace of Christ relied on. Believers, by the power of grace, are brought up from the wilderness. A sinful state is a wilderness in which there is no true comfort; it is a wandering, wanting state: There is no coming out of this wilderness, but leaning on Christ as our Beloved, by faith; not leaning to our own understanding, nor trusting in any righteousness of our own; but in the strength of him, who is the Lord our Righteousness. The words of the church to Christ which follow, entreat an abiding place in his love, and protection by his power. Set me as a seal upon thine heart; let me always have a place in thine heart; let me have an impression of love upon thine heart. Of this the soul would be assured, and without a sense thereof no rest is to be found. Those who truly love Christ, are jealous of every thing that would draw them from him; especially of themselves, lest they should do any thing to provoke him to withdraw from them. If we love Christ, the fear of coming short of his love, or the temptations to forsake him, will be most painful to us. No waters can quench Christ's love to us, nor any floods drown it. Let nothing abate our love to him. Nor will life, and all its comforts, entice a believer from loving Christ. Love of Christ, will enable us to repel and triumph over temptations from the smiles of the world, as well as from its frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bride says this as she clings to his arm and rests her head upon his bosom.

These are still the words of the church, speaking to Christ as she walked along with him, as the affixes in the Hebrew text show; in which she desires to have a fixed abiding place in his heart; to continue firmly in his love, and to have further manifestations of it; to be always remembered and supported by him; to be ever on his mind, and constantly under his care and protection; and to have a full assurance of interest in his love, and in his power, which is the sealing work of his Spirit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>. The allusion seems to be to the high: priest, a type of Christ, who had the names of the children of Israel engraved on precious stones, and bore by him on his shoulders, and on his heart, for a memorial before the Lord continually; or to the names of persons, engraved on jewels, wore by lovers on their arms or breasts, or to their pictures put there; not to signets or seals wore on those parts, but to the names and images of persons impressed on them: the Ethiopians (p) understand it of something bound upon the arm, by which persons might be known, as was used in their country. The church's desire is, that she might be affectionately loved by Christ, be deeply fixed in his heart, be ever in his view, owned and acknowledged by him, and protected by the arm of his power. Her reasons follow: <p>for love is strong as death; that is, the love or the church to Christ, which caused her to make the above requests: death conquers all; against it there is no standing; such was the love of the church, it surmounted all difficulties that lay in the way of enjoying Christ; nothing could separate from it; she was conquered by it herself (q); and could not live without him; a frown, an angry look from him, was as death unto her; yea, she could readily part with life and suffer death for his sake; death itself could not part her from him, or separate him from her love (r); so that her love was stronger than death; <p>jealousy is cruel as the grave: the jealousy she had of Christ's love to her which was her weakness; and yet it was very torturing and afflicting, though at the same time it showed the greatness of her love to Christ: or "envy", that is of wicked men, she was the object of, which exceeds cruel wrath and outrageous anger, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-4.htm">Proverbs 27:4</a>; or rather her "zeal" (s), which is no other than ardent love for Christ his Gospel, cause, and interest; which ate up and consumed her spirits, as the grave does what is cast into it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-139.htm">Psalm 119:139</a>. Virgil (t) gives the epithet of "cruel" to love; <p>the coals thereof are coals of fire; which expresses the fervency of her love to Christ, and zeal for the honour of his name: which, though sometimes cold and languid, is rekindled, and becomes hot and flaming; and is, like fire, insatiable, one of the four things that say, "It is not enough", <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-16.htm">Proverbs 30:16</a>; <p>which hath a most vehement flame; nothing is, nor, common with other writers (u), than to attribute flame to love, and to call it a fire; here a most vehement flame. Or, "the flame of Jah" or "Jehovah" (w); an exceeding great one: the Hebrews use one or other of the names of God, as a superlative; so the mountains of God, and cedars of God, mean exceeding great ones; and here it expresses the church's love in the highest degree, in such a flame as not to be quenched, as follows: or it signifies, that the flame of love in her breast was kindled by the Lord himself (x), by his Spirit, compared to fire; or by his love, shed abroad in her heart by him, Hence it appears to be false, what is sometimes said, that the name of God is not used in this Song; since the greatest of all his names, Jab or Jehovah, is here expressed. <p>(p) Apud Ludolph.

This last passage interprets the bride’s request. She wishes to be united in the closest way with her lover, and to be valued as his most precious possessions were valued. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-23.htm" title="In that day, said the LORD of hosts, will I take you, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, said the LORD, and will make you as a signet: for I have chosen you, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:23</a>. Budde, perhaps rightly, would put for the second <span class="ital">châthôm</span>=‘seal,’ some word like <span class="ital">tsâmîdh</span>, signifying a bracelet. Cp. Tennyson’s <span class="ital">Miller’s Daughter</span>, where the lover longs to be a jewel in his lady’s ear:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“It is the miller’s daughter,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And she is grown so dear, so dear,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That I would be the jewel,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That trembles in her ear.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">strong as death</span>] Love is as irresistible as death, which none can escape.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">jealousy</span> is <span class="ital">cruel as the grave</span>] Jealousy is as unrelenting as Sheol, the place of the dead, from which none can ever escape; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm" title="Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.">Proverbs 27:20</a>. The meaning is that love and jealousy have irresistible power over those whom they bring under their sway.

Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it; if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would be utterly contemned.</span> Is this to be regarded as the reply of the bride to the tender allusion of her husband to their first love; or is it, as some think, only the first words which belong to the bride, while the rest of the two verses are a kind of chorus echoing her loving appeal, and bringing the general action of the poem to a conclusion? It is difficult to decide this, and the meaning is not affected either way. Perhaps, however, it is best to take it as spoken by the bride, who continues her address to the end of the eighth verse. She is full of joy in the return of perfect confidence; she prays that the full tide of affection may never cease to flow, that there be no ebbing of that happy feeling in which she now delights; and then sings the praise of love itself, as though a prelude of praise to a long and eternal peace. The seal is the signet ring, <span class="accented">chotham</span>, from a root "to impress" It was sometimes carried by a string on the breast, and would, therefore, be near the heart (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-18.htm">Genesis 38:18</a>). It was sometimes worn on the hand (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>). It was not worn on the arm like a bracelet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>). Probably it was not the signet ring which is referred to in the second clause: "Set me as a seal on thine  heart, and as a bracelet on thine arm." The same simile is not infrequent in the prophets. The desire of Shulamith was to escape all possibility of those declensions of which she had spoken before. "Let me never be out of thy thoughts; let me never go back from my fulness of joy in thy love." The true believer understands well such language. He knows that the maintenance of devout affection is not a matter of mere desire and will. The Lord himself must help us with his blessed gifts, the influence of his gracious Spirit to overcome the feebleness and fickleness of a fallen heart. We want to be close to the heart of the Saviour; we want to be constantly in his eye, and so diligently employed in his service, so closely associated with the work of his mighty arm, that we shall be ever receiving from him the signs and evidences of his approval and affection. The purity and perfection of true love are the theme of every sincere believer. The priceless value of such love is described in the Book of Proverbs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>. It is an unquenchable flame - nothing can resist it. We cannot but recall the rapturous language of one who himself was an example of the highest devotedness to the Saviour, who rejoiced over death and the grave in the consciousness of victory through him from whose love nothing can separate us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>). Certainly the history of the sufferings and trials of the true Church form a most striking commentary upon these words. Floods of persecution have swept over it, but they have not quenched love. The flame has burst forth again and again when it seemed to be extinguished, and it has become a very "flame of the Lord." The bush has been burning, but has not been consumed. By jealousy is intended love in its intensity not bearing arival. The "flame of the Lord" may be compared with "the voice of the Lord," which is described in Hebrew poetry as connected with the fury of the storm. The flame, therefore, would be lightning and the voice thunder. The whole of this passage, which forms a kind of keynote of the poem, is more like a distinct strain introduced to give climax to the succession of songs than the natural expression of the bride's feelings. It has been always regarded as one of the sublimest apostrophes to love to be found anywhere. The enemies of God and of humanity are represented as falling before it, death and the grave. Its vehemence and force of manifestation are brought vividly before us by the comparison of the flash of lightning. It is remarkable that this exaltation of love should be included in the Old Testament, thus proving that the Mosaic Law, with its formal prescriptions, by no means fulfils the whole purpose of God in his revelation to the world. As the New Testament would not have been complete without the message of the beloved disciple, so this Old Testament must have its song of love. Nor is it only the ideal and the heavenly love which is celebrated, but human affection itself is placed very high, because it is associated with that which is Divine. It is a more precious thing than mere wealth or worldly honour, and he that trifles with it deserves the utmost scorn and contempt of his fellows. It is well to remark how consistently the poetic framework is maintained. There is no attempt to leave the lines of human relations even at this point, whets evidently the sentiment rises above them. The love which is apostrophized is not removed from earth in order to be seen apart from all earthly imperfections and impurities. We are invited rather to look through the human to the Divine which embraces it and glorifies it. That. is the method of the Divine revelation throughout. "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." We do not need to take Solomon's Song as an allegory. It is a song of human love, but as such it is a symbol of that which is Divine. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12 In the morning we will start for the vineyards,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See whether the vine is in bloom,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the vine-blossoms have opened,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pomegranates budded - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will I give thee my love.<p>13 The mandrakes breathe a pleasant odour, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And over our doors are all kinds of excellent fruits,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New, also old,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which, my beloved, I have kept for thee.<p>As the rising up early follows the tarrying over night, the description of that which is longed for moves forward.

They wished in the morning, when the life of nature can best be observed, and its growth and progress and striving upwards best contemplated, to see whether the vine had opened, i.e., unfolded (thus, Sol 6:11), whether the vine-blossom (vid., at Sol 2:13) had expanded (lxx &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), whether the pomegranate had its flowers or flower-buds (&#1492;&#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, as at Sol 6:11); &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495; is here, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a>, used as internally transitive: to accomplish or to undergo the opening, as also (Arab.) fattah&#803; <p>(Note: Vid., Fleischer, Makkari, 1868, p. 271.)<p>is used of the blooming of flowers, for (Arab.) tafttah&#803; (to unfold). The vineyards, inasmuch as she does not say &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, are not alone those of her family, but generally those of her home, but of her home; for these are the object of her desire, which in this pleasant journey with her beloved she at once in imagination reaches, flying, as it were, over the intermediate space. There, in undisturbed quietness, and in a lovely region consecrating love, will she give herself to him in the entire fulness of her love. By &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; she means the evidences of her love (vid., under Sol 4:10; Sol 1:2), which she will there grant to him as thankful responses to his own. Thus she speaks in the spring-time, in the month Ijjar, corresponding to our Wonnemond (pleasure-month, May), and seeks to give emphasis to her promise by this, that she directs him to the fragrant "mandragoras," and to the precious fruits of all kinds which she has kept for him on the shelf in her native home.<p>&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; (after the form &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;), love's flower, is the mandragora officinalis, L., with whitish green flowers and yellow apples of the size of nutmegs, belonging to the Solanaceae; its fruits and roots are used as an aphrodisiac, therefore this plant was called by the Arabs abd al-sal'm, the servant of love, postillon d'amour; the son of Leah found such mandrakes (lxx <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-14.htm">Genesis 30:14</a>, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;) at the time of the vintage, which falls in the month of Ijjar; they have a strong but pleasant odour. In Jerusalem mandrakes are rare; but so much the more abundantly are they found growing wild in Galilee, whither Shulamith is transported in spirit. Regarding the &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;, occurring in the sing. exclusively in the blessing of Moses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>), which in the Old Testament is peculiar to the Song, vid., Sol 4:13, Sol 4:16. From "over our doors," down to "I have kept for thee," is, according to the lxx, Syr., Jerome, and others, one sentence, which in itself is not inadmissible; for the object can precede its verb, Sol 3:3, and can stand as the subject between the place mentioned and the verb, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a>, also as the object, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-6.htm">2 Chronicles 31:6</a>, which, as in the passage before us, may be interpunctuated with Athnach for the sake of emphasis; in the bibl. Chald. this inverted sequence of the words is natural, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17</a>. But such a long-winded sentence is at least not in the style of the Song, and one does not rightly see why just "over our doors" has the first place in it. I therefore formerly translated it as did Luther, dividing it into parts: "and over our doors are all kinds of precious fruits; I have," etc. But with this departure from the traditional division of the verse nothing is gained; for the "keeping" (laying up) refers naturally to the fruits of the preceding year, and in the first instance can by no means refer to fruits of this year, especially as Shulamith, according to the structure of the poem, has not visited her parental home since her home-bringing in marriage, and now for the first time, in the early summer, between the barley harvest and the wheat harvest, is carried away thither in her longing. Therefore the expression, "my beloved, I have kept for thee," is to be taken by itself, but not as an independent sentence (Bttch.), but is to be rendered, with Ewald, as a relative clause; and this, with Hitz., is to be referred to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (old). Col refers to the many sorts of precious fruits which, after the time of their ingathering, are divided into "new and old" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-52.htm">Matthew 13:52</a>). The plur. "our doors," which as amplif. poet. would not be appropriate here, supposes several entrances into her parents' home; and since "I have kept" refers to a particular preserving of choice fruits, al does not (Hitzig) refer to a floor, such as the floor above the family dwelling or above the barn, but to the shelf above the inner doors, a board placed over them, on which certain things are wont to be laid past for some particular object. She speaks to the king like a child; for although highly elevated, she yet remains, without self-elation, a child. </body></html>
