The mountain of myrrh appears to mean the mountain Moriah, on which the temple was built, where the incense was burned, and the people worshipped the Lord. This was his residence till the shadows of the law given to Moses were dispersed by the breaking of the gospel day, and the rising of the Sun of righteousness. And though, in respect of his human nature, Christ is absent from his church on earth, and will continue to be so till the heavenly day break, yet he is spiritually present in his ordinances, and with his people. How fair and comely are believers, when justified in Christ's righteousness, and adorned with spiritual graces! when their thoughts, words, and deeds, though imperfect, are pure, manifesting a heart nourished by the gospel!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "tower of David" may be that mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Nehemiah 3:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-8.htm">Micah 4:8</a>.

The <span class="ital">lilies</span> being white and swelling, and the roes of a reddish colour, and their bodies being hid from sight by the lilies, their heads only appearing above them, bear some resemblance to the red nipples appearing in the top of the lily white breasts. But we must remember that this book is a sacred pastoral, and the Bridegroom is represented as a shepherd, and the bride as a country maid; and therefore such similitudes are used as are agreeable to persons of that quality, and such are usual in profane writers of this kind, as the learned have observed.

Or, "two fawns, the twins of a doe": Providence, as Plutarch observes (p), has given to women two breasts, that, should they have twins, both might have a fountain of nourishment; and are fitly compared to twins of the doe. The hind, for the most part, brings but one roe at a time; but there are some, the philosopher says (q), bring twins; by which the beauty of the breasts is expressed: "young roes" may point at the smallness of them, large breasts are not accounted handsome; and "twins", at their equal size and shape, not one larger nor higher than the other, that would be a deformity; twins are generally alike; <p>which feed among the lilies; and are fat and plump: the allusion may be to the putting of lilies in the bosom, between the breasts, as other flowers; lilies are reckoned among the decorations of women, in the Apocryha: <p>"And pulled off the sackcloth which she had on, and put off the garments of her widowhood, and washed her body all over with water, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braided the hair of her head, and put on a tire upon it, and put on her garments of gladness, wherewith she was clad during the life of Manasses her husband.'' (Judith 10:3) <p>or rather to the creatures mentioned, the roes and hinds, which feed among lilies, in fields where lilies grow; for these grow in fields as well as in gardens, and are called the "lilies of the field", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28</a>; and we read (r) sometimes of harts and hinds among lilies. By "breasts" may be meant, either the ministers of the word, who impart "the sincere milk of the word", and who deliver out the nourishing doctrines of grace, like milk out of the breast, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2</a>; and may be like to "roes" for their affection to those who are under their ministry; and pleasant to them, to whom they are made useful; and for their sharp sightedness and penetration into the mysteries of grace; and for their quick dispatch in doing their work, though through many difficulties, which, like young roes, they leap and skip over: and "two" of them show a sufficient number of them Christ provides for his church; and being "twins" express their equal authority, and harmony of doctrine; and feeding "among lilies" is where Christ himself feeds, Sol 2:16; where Christ feeds they feed, and where they feed Christ feeds, even among his saints, comparable to lilies, Sol 2:2; or these "breasts" may design the two Testaments, the Old and New, which contain the whole sincere milk of the word; are like "young roes", pleasant and delightful to believers; and, as "twins", are alike, agree in their doctrines concerning Christ, and the blessings of grace through him; the types, figures, prophecies, and promises of the one, have their completion in the other; and both abound with the lilies of Gospel doctrines and promises: though rather these "breasts" may point at the two ordinances of the Gospel, baptism, and the Lord's supper; which are breasts of consolation to believers, out of which they suck, and are satisfied; and through feeding on Christ in both, they receive much nourishment and strength; and are very amiable and lovely to the saints, when they enjoy the presence of Christ in them, and have the discoveries of his love to them; and may be said to be "twins", being both instituted by Christ, and both lead unto him, and require the same subjects; and are received and submitted to by saints, comparable to lilies, as before. <p>(p) De Liberis Educand. vol. 2. p. 3.((q) Aristot. de Animal. l. 6. c. 29.

The meadow covered with lilies suggests beauty and fragrance. Thus the loveliness of the bride is set forth in seven comparisons, her perfections being sevenfold. "A twin pair of the young of the gazelle, lying in a bed covered with lilies, representing the fragrant delicacy and elegance of a chaste virgin besom, veiled by the folds of a dress redolent of sweet odour" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-13.htm">Song of Solomon 1:13</a>).

The appiryon here described has a silver pedestal and a purple cushion - as we read in Athenaeus v. 13 (II p.  ed. Schweigh.) that the philosopher and tyrant Athenion showed himself "on a silver-legged &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, with purple coverlet;" and the same author, v. 5 (II p. , also says, that on the occasion of a festal procession by Antiochus Epiphanes, behind 200 women who sprinkled ointments from golden urns came 80 women, sitting in pomp on golden-legged, and 500 on silver-legged, &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1; - this is the proper name for the costly women's-litter (Suidas: &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), which, according to the number of bearers (Mart. VI 77: six Cappadocians and, ix. 2, eight Syrians), was called &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (hexaphorum, Mart. II 81) or &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (octophorum, Cicero's Verr. v. 10). The Mishna, Sota ix. 14, uses appiryon in the sense of &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;: "in the last war (that of Hadrian) it was decreed that a bride should not pass through the town in an appiryon on account of the danger, but our Rabbis sanctioned it later for modesty's sake;" as here, "to be carried in an appiryon," so in Greek, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;. In the Midrash also, Bamidbar rabba c. 12, and elsewhere, appiryon of this passage before us is taken in all sorts of allegorical significations in most of which the identity of the word with &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; is supposed, which is also there written &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; (after Aruch), cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>, Targ., and is once interchanged with &#1508;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, papilio (parillon), pleasure-tent. But a Greek word in the Song is in itself so improbable, that Ewald describes this derivation of the word as a frivolous jest; so much the more improbable, as &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; as the name of a litter (lectica) occurs first in such authors (of the &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;) as Plutarch, Polybuis, Herodian, and the like, and therefore, with greater right, it may be supposed that it is originally a Semitic word, which the Greek language adopted at the time when the Oriental and Graeco-Roman customs began to be amalgamated. Hence, if mitta&#772; Sol 3:7, means a portable bed, -  is evident from this, that it appears as the means of transport with an escort, - then appiryon cannot also mean a litter; the description, moreover, does not accord with a litter. We do not read of rings and carrying-poles, but, on the contrary, of pillars (as those of a tent-bed) instead, and, as might be expected, of feet. Schlottm., however, takes mitta&#772; and appiryon as different names for a portable bed; but the words, "an appiryon has King Solomon made," etc., certainly indicate that he who thus speaks has not the appiryon before him, and also that this was something different from the mitta&#772;. While Schlottm. is inclined to take appiryon, in the sense of a litter, as a word borrowed from the Greek (but in the time of the first king?), Gesen. in his Thes. seeks to derive it, thus understood, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, cito ferri, currere; but this signification of the verb is imaginary.<p>We expect here, in accordance with the progress of the scene, the name of the bridal couch; and on the supposition that appiryon, Sota 12a, as in the Mishna, means the litter (Aruch) of the bride, Arab. maziffat, and not torus nuptialis (Buxt.), then there is a possibility that appiryon is a more dignified word for 'e&#780;re&#780;s, Sol 1:17, yet sufficient thereby to show that &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; is the usual Talm. name of the marriage-bed (e.g., Mezia 23b, where it stand, per meton., for concubitus), which is wittily explained by &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; (Kethuboth 10b, and elsewhere). The Targ. has for it the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; (vid., Levy). It thus designates a bed with a canopy (a tent-bed), <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-50.htm">Deuteronomy 32:50</a>, Jerus; so that the ideas of the bed of state and the palanquin (cf. &#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, canopy, and &#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1514; &#1495;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, bridal-bed, Succa 11a) touch one another. In general, &#1508;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; (&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, as is also the case with appiryon, must have been originally a common designation of certain household furniture with a common characteristic; for the Syr. aprautha, plur. parjevatha (Wiseman's Horae, p. 255), or also parha (Castell.), signifies a cradle. It is then to be inquired, whether this word is referable to a root-word which gives a common characteristic with manifold applications. But the Heb. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, from the R. pr, signifies to split, <p>(Note: Vid., Friedr. Delitzsch's Indogerman.-semit. Studien, p. 72.)<p>to tear asunder, to break forth, to bring fruit, to be fruitful, and nothing further. Paaraa has nowhere the signification to run, as already remarked; only in the Palest.-Aram. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; is found in this meaning (vid., Buxt.). The Arab. farr does not signify to run, but to flee; properly (like our "ausreissen"  equals  be tear out, to break out), to break open by flight the rank in which one stands (as otherwise turned by horse-dealers: to open wide the horse's mouth). But, moreover, we do not thus reach the common characteristic which we are in search of; for if we may say of the litter that it runs, yet we cannot say that of a bed or a cradle, etc. The Arab. farfa&#770;r, species vehiculi muliebris, also does not help us; for the verb farfar, to vacillate, to shake, is its appropriate root-word.<p>(Note: The Turkish Ka&#770;mu&#770;s says of farfa&#770;r: "it is the name of a vehicle (merkeb), like the camel-litter (haudej), destined merely for women." This also derives its name from rocking to and fro. So farfa&#770;r, for farfara is to the present day the usual word for agiter, scouer les ailes; farfarah, for lgret; furfu&#770;r, for butterfly (cf. Ital. farfalla); generally, the ideas of that which is light and of no value - e.g., a babbler-connect themselves with the root far in several derivatives.)<p>With better results shall we compare the Arab. fary, which, in Kal and Hiph., signifies to break open, to cut out (couper, tailler une toffe), and also, figuratively, to bring forth something strange, something not yet existing (yafry alfaryya, according to the Arab. Lex.  equals  yaty bal'ajab fy 'amalh, he accomplishes something wonderful); the primary meaning in Conj. viii. is evidently: yftarra kidban, to cut out lies, to meditate and to express that which is calumnious (a similar metaphor to khar'a, findere, viii. fingere, to cut out something in the imagination; French, inventer, imaginer). With this fary, however, we do not immediately reach &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;; for fary, as well as fara (farw), are used only of cutting to pieces, cutting out, sewing together of leather and other materials (cf. Arab. farwat, fur; farra&#772;, furrier), but not of cutting and preparing wood.<p>But why should not the Semitic language have used &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, also, in the sense of the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, which signifies <p>continued...</body></html>
