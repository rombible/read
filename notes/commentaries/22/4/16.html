Graces in the soul are as spices in these gardens, that in them which is valuable and useful. The blessed Spirit, in his work upon the soul, is as the wind. There is the north wind of conviction, and the south wind of comfort. He stirs up good affections, and works in us both to will and to do that which is good. The church invites Christ. Let him have the honour of all the garden produces, and let us have the comfort of his acceptance of it. We can invite him to nothing but what is his own already. The believer can have no joy of the fruits, unless they redound some way or other to the glory of Christ. Let us then seek to keep separate from the world, as a garden enclosed, and to avoid conformity thereto.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/songs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bride's brief reply, declaring her affection for the king and willingness to belong to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/songs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. Awake&#8212;literally, "arise." All besides is ready; one thing alone is wanted&#8212;the breath of God. This follows rightly after His death (So 6:12; Ac 2:1-4). It is His call to the Spirit to come (Joh 14:16); in Joh 3:8, compared to "the wind"; quickening (Joh 6:63; Eze 27:9). Saints offer the same prayer (Ps 85:6; Hab 3:2). The north wind "awakes," or arises strongly, namely, the Holy Ghost as a reprover (Joh 16:8-11); the south wind "comes" gently, namely, the Holy Ghost as the comforter (Joh 14:16). The west wind brings rain from the sea (1Ki 18:44, 45; Lu 12:54). The east wind is tempestuous (Job 27:21; Isa 27:8) and withering (Ge 41:23). These, therefore, are not wanted; but first the north wind clearing the air (Job 37:22; Pr 25:23), and then the warm south wind (Job 37:17); so the Holy Ghost first clearing away mists of gloom, error, unbelief, sin, which intercept the light of Jesus Christ, then infusing spiritual warmth (2Co 4:6), causing the graces to exhale their odor.<p>Let my beloved, &c.&#8212;the bride's reply. The fruit was now at length ripe; the last passover, which He had so desired, is come (Lu 22:7, 15, 16, 18), the only occasion in which He took charge of the preparations.<p>his&#8212;answering to Jesus Christ's "My." She owns that the garden is His, and the fruits in her, which she does not in false humility deny (Ps 66:16; Ac 21:19; 1Co 15:10) are His (Joh 15:8; Php 1:11).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/songs/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Awake; </span> or, <span class="ital">arise</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

These words, according to some (l), are the words of the church continued, praying for the spirit; to which sense the order and connection of the words seem to incline; though the language suits best with Christ, who has the command of the winds, and a right and property in the garden, the church: nor does it seem so agreeable, that the church should petition Christ to let loose the north wind upon her, if by that are meant afflictive dispensations of Providence; but agrees well enough with Christ, since these come not without his will and order, and by him made to work together for good; by which he nips the corruptions of his people, tries their graces, and causes them to come forth into exercise: though some (m) think this is a command to the north wind to remove, and be gone, and blow no longer, since it was spring, Sol 2:11; and would be harmful to the plants in the garden; and the verb "blow" is singular, and only in construction with the south wind; and, besides, winds diametrically opposite (n) cannot blow together in the same horizon, with a continued blast: though others (o) are of opinion, that both winds are designed, being both useful to gardens; the one to scatter the clouds, and make the air clear and wholesome, and restrain the luxuriance of the plants; and the other, being moist and warming, of use to bring plants and fruits to maturity; and both may design the Spirit of God, in his different operations and effects, through the law and the terrors of it, and by the Gospel and its comforting doctrines; <p>and come, thou south, blow upon my garden; the church, Christ's property, as she asserts in the latter part of the verse: the Spirit of God is intended by the "south", or south wind; who is compared to the "wind", because it blows like that, freely, and as he pleases, when, where, and on whom, and imperceptibly, powerfully, and irresistibly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>; and to the "south wind", because it is a warm wind, brings serenity, and makes fruitful with showers of rain: so the Spirit of God warms the cold heart of a sinner; thaws his frozen soul, and comforts with the discoveries of divine love; brings quietness and peace into the conscience; and makes fruitful in grace and good works, by causing the rain of Gospel doctrines to descend and distil upon men. The end to be answered is, <p>that the spices thereof may flow out; the spices in the garden, the odoriferous plants, might emit a fragrant smell; though Virgil (p) represents the south wind as harmful to flowers; so it might be in Italy, where it dried them up, as Servius on the place observes; and yet be useful to them in Palestine, where it blew from the sea, and is sometimes so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-3.htm">Psalm 107:3</a>. Spices denote the graces of believers, rare, precious, and odorous; and their "flowing out" the exercise of them, their evidence, increase, and the ripening of them; when they diffuse a sweet odour to Christ and others, and make it delightful to walk in his garden; as it is to walk in one after a delightful shower of rain, and when the wind gently blows upon it. And hence what is prayed for being granted, the church speaks again, and invites Christ, saying; <p>let my beloved come into his garden; which "coming" is to be understood, not of Christ's first, nor of his second coming; but of his spiritual coming, to visit his people, grant his presence, and manifest his love; which is very desirable by them; and, when granted, is reckoned a great favour, and is an instance of the condescending grace of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22</a>; the church is "his garden" by his own choice, his Father's gift, the purchase of his blood, and the power of his grace: and here he is invited to come, <p>and eat his pleasant fruits; meaning either the graces of the Spirit, which are his fruits; and called Christ's, because they come from him, and are exercised on him, and he is the author and finisher of them: or the good works of believers, which are performed by virtue of union to him, and abiding in him; are done in his strength, and designed for his glory: and both are "pleasant", that is, well pleasing and acceptable to him; the graces of the Spirit, when in exercise, as appears from Sol 4:9; and good works, when done in faith, from a principle of love, and to his glory: and he may be said to eat them when he expresses his well pleasedness with them, and acceptation of them. <p>(l) So Cocceius, Marckius, Michaelis.

It is doubtful whether this whole verse is spoken by the Shulammite, or the latter clause only, her lover being still the speaker in the first half of the verse. That he is still the speaker in the first clause is suggested by ‘<span class="ital">my</span> garden’ in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-16.htm" title="Awake, O north wind; and come, you south; blow on my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.

But the change of pronoun is quite compatible with the view that the bride is the speaker throughout. <span class="ital">My garden</span> would then be ‘myself,’ ‘my person,’ as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-6.htm" title="Look not on me, because I am black, because the sun has looked on me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard have I not kept.">Song of Solomon 1:6</a>, ‘my vineyard.’ <span class="ital">His garden</span> again, in the mouth of the Shulammite indicates, as Oettli well remarks, “a certain shamefast modesty.” Probably the view that the bride speaks the whole verse is preferable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Awake, O north wind</span>] The north wind is cool in Palestine, and the south or south-west wind is warm. They are here called upon to bring forth, by their alternation, the <span class="bld">perfumes</span> (not <span class="ital">the spices</span>) of the garden, that they may flow out, i.e. she desires that the graces of her person and her mind may come to their highest perfection. This would be more appropriate in the mouth of the bride, who like all true lovers would desire to be nobler and more beautiful than she is, that her lover might find her worthy, than in the mouth of her lover, who would naturally think of her as being altogether fair.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Let my beloved come into his garden</span>, &c.] This last clause of the verse is spoken, it should be remembered, by a loving woman shut up in a royal dwelling away from her lover, and expresses her longing for the time when she shall be wholly his.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pleasant fruits</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">precious fruits</span>, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-13.htm" title="Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,">Song of Solomon 4:13</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his precious fruits.</span> This is the answer of the bride to the lavish praises of her husband. I am all his. She is yet unworthy of the king and of his love until the seasonal changes have developed and unfolded and spread forth her excellences. The north represents cold; the south, heat. Let the various influences from different quarters flow gently over the garden and call forth the fragrance and the fruits (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>). There is rich suggestion in such words. Whether we think of the individual soul or of the Church of Christ, the true desire of those who delight in the love of the Saviour is that all the gifts and graces which can be bestowed may make them worthy of him who condescends to call his people his delight. Surely it is no mere romantic idyll that is before us. Such significance cannot be a mere coincidence when it is so transparent and so apt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He proceeds still further to praise her attractions.<p>10 How fair is thy love, my sister-bride!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much better thy love than wine!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fragrance of thy unguents than all spices!<p>11 Thy lips drop honey, my bride;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honey and milk are under thy tongue;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fragrance of thy garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.<p>Regarding the connection of the pluralet. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; with the plur. of the pred., vid., at Sol 1:2. The pred. &#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; praises her love in its manifestations according to its impression on the sight; &#1496;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, according to its experience on nearer intercourse. As in Sol 4:9 the same power of impression is attributed to the eyes and to the necklace, so here is intermingled praise of the beauty of her person with praise of the fragrance, the odour of the clothing of the bride; for her soul speaks out not only by her lips, she breathes forth odours also for him in her spices, which he deems more fragrant than all other odours, because he inhales, as it were, her soul along with them. &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;, from &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;, ebullire (vid., under <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a>, also Schultens), is virgin honey, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (acetum, Pliny, xi. 15), i.e., that which of itself flows from the combs (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;). Honey drops from the lips which he kisses; milk and honey are under the tongue which whispers to him words of pure and inward joy; cf. the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-4.htm">Psalm 140:4</a>. The last line is an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27</a>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; is &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492; (from &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1500;, complicare, complecti) transposed (cf. &#1506;&#1500;&#1504;&#1492; from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;). As Jacob's raiment had for his old father the fragrance of a field which God had blessed, so for Solomon the garments of the faultless and pure one, fresh from the woods and mountains of the north, gave forth a heart-strengthening savour like the fragrance of Lebanon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-7.htm">Hosea 4:7</a>), viz., of its fragrant herbs and trees, chiefly of the balsamic odour of the apples of the cedar. </body></html>
