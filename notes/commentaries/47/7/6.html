In the word for “cast down” (<span class= "ital">lowly</span>) we may, perhaps, trace an allusion to the same word used of him by others as a disparaging epithet. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2Corinthians 10:1</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:5-11 There were fightings without, or continual contentions with, and opposition from Jews and Gentiles; and there were fears within, and great concern for such as had embraced the Christian faith. But God comforts those who are cast down. We should look above and beyond all means and instruments, to God, as the author of all the consolation and good we enjoy. Sorrow according to the will of God, tending to the glory of God, and wrought by the Spirit of God, renders the heart humble, contrite, submissive, disposed to mortify every sin, and to walk in newness of life. And this repentance is connected with saving faith in Christ, and an interest in his atonement. There is a great difference between this sorrow of a godly sort, and the sorrow of the world. The happy fruits of true repentance are mentioned. Where the heart is changed, the life and actions will be changed. It wrought indignation at sin, at themselves, at the tempter and his instruments. It wrought a fear of watchfulness, and a cautious fear of sin. It wrought desire to be reconciled with God. It wrought zeal for duty, and against sin. It wrought revenge against sin and their own folly, by endeavours to make satisfaction for injuries done thereby. Deep humility before God, hatred of all sin, with faith in Christ, a new heart and a new life, make repentance unto salvation. May the Lord bestow it on every one of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God that comforteth those that are cast down - Whose characteristic is, that be gives consolation to those who are anxious and depressed.

Comp. Ewald. The usual view, that Paul meant to say: <span class="ital">through the comfort which he brought to me, for he related to me</span>, etc., and thus wrote with logical inaccuracy, is as arbitrary as Hofmann’s way of escaping the difficulty—for which he adduces erroneously <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>—that it must have run properly (?) in the form of <span class="greekheb">παρακληθεὶς ἀνήγγειλεν</span>. Certainly Titus had himself been comforted by what he saw in Corinth; but psychologically it was most natural that this “being comforted” on the part of Titus should be repeated and renewed by his <span class="ital">communicating</span> to Paul and Timothy his cheering observations and experiences, and so they too were comforted with the comfort which was afforded to Titus himself by the report which he was able to give. This interpretation—in which there is thus not to be assumed any blending of the comfort which Titus had felt in perceiving the improved state of matters at Corinth, and then in communicating it (Osiander)—is neither unnatural (Hofmann) nor turning on punctilious reflection (de Wette), but founded necessarily on the words, which Paul has not <span class="ital">written</span> otherwise, just because he has not <span class="ital">conceived</span> them otherwis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπιπόθησιν</span>] <span class="ital">longing</span>, namely, to see me again among yo.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὀδυρμόν</span>] <span class="ital">lamentation</span>, for having saddened me so by the disorders tolerated in your church, especially in reference to the incestuous person.

Nägelsbach on the <span class="ital">Iliad</span>, p. 227, ed. 3.

Observe in this the emphatic prefixing, thrice repeated, of the <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, which gives the key to this <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον χαρῆναι</span>. The former Epistle had had its effect. <span class="ital">He</span> had previously had <span class="ital">for them</span> longing, pain, zeal; now, <span class="ital">on their part</span>, such longing, etc., had set in <span class="ital">for him</span>. Thus the position of things had happily changed <span class="ital">on the part of the church</span>, which before was so indifferent, and in part even worse, in its mood towards Paul. Billroth, following Bengel, takes it: so that I rather <span class="ital">rejoiced, i.e.</span> so that my former pain was not merely taken away, but was changed into joy.

The word "humble" has in classical Greek the sense of "mean," "abject." Pride, not humility, was the virtue even of Stoic morality.

Doubtless the word still retained some of its old associations, and had been used of St. Paul in a disparaging sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>). But he whom his opponents accused of so much egotism, ambition, and arrogance, meekly accepts the term and applies it to himself.

The absence of Titus from the Acts is another proof of the fragmentariness of that book. It is evident that he was an ardent, able, active fellow worker, and most beloved friend of the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>).
