But God comforts those who are cast down. We should look above and beyond all means and instruments, to God, as the author of all the consolation and good we enjoy. Sorrow according to the will of God, tending to the glory of God, and wrought by the Spirit of God, renders the heart humble, contrite, submissive, disposed to mortify every sin, and to walk in newness of life. And this repentance is connected with saving faith in Christ, and an interest in his atonement. There is a great difference between this sorrow of a godly sort, and the sorrow of the world. The happy fruits of true repentance are mentioned. Where the heart is changed, the life and actions will be changed. It wrought indignation at sin, at themselves, at the tempter and his instruments. It wrought a fear of watchfulness, and a cautious fear of sin. It wrought desire to be reconciled with God. It wrought zeal for duty, and against sin. It wrought revenge against sin and their own folly, by endeavours to make satisfaction for injuries done thereby. Deep humility before God, hatred of all sin, with faith in Christ, a new heart and a new life, make repentance unto salvation. May the Lord bestow it on every one of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For behold this self-same thing - For see in your own case the happy effects of godly sorrow. See the effects which it produced; see an illustration of what it is suited to produce. The construction is, "For lo! this very thing, to wit, your sorrowing after a godly manner, wrought carefulness, clearing of yourselves," etc. The object of Paul is to illustrate the effects of godly sorrow, to which he had referred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>. He appeals, therefore, to their own case, and says that it was beautifully illustrated among themselves.<p>What carefulness - (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;  spoude&#772;n). This word properly denotes "speed, haste;" then diligence, earnest effort, forwardness. Here it is evidently used to denote the diligence and the great anxiety which they manifested to remove the evils which existed among them. They went to work to remove them. They did not sit down to mourn over them merely, nor did they wait for God to remove them, nor did they plead that they could do nothing, but they set about the work as though they believed it might be done. When people are thoroughly convinced of sin, they will set about removing it with the utmost diligence. They will feel that this can be done, and must be done, or that the soul will be lost.<p>What clearing of yourselves - (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  apologian). Apology. This word properly means a plea or defense before a tribunal or elsewhere; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16</a>. Tyndale renders it, "Yea, it caused you to clear yourselves." The word here properly means "apology" for what had been done; and it probably refers here to the effort which would be made by the sounder part of the church to clear themselves from blame in what had occurred. It does not mean that the guilty, when convicted of sin, will attempt to vindicate themselves and to apologize to God for what they had done; but it means that the church at Corinth were anxious to state to Titus all the mitigating circumstances of the case: they showed great solicitude to free themselves, as far as could be done, from blame; they were anxious, as far as could be, to show that they had not approved of what had occurred, and perhaps that it had occurred only because it could not have been prevented. We are not to suppose that all the things here referred to occurred in the same individuals, and that the same persons precisely evinced diligence, and made the apology, etc. It was done by the church; all evinced deep feeling; but some manifested it in one way, and some in another. The whole church was roused, and all felt, and all endeavored in the proper way to free themselves from the blame, and to remove the evil from among them.<p>Yea, what indignation - Indignation against the sin, and perhaps against the persons who had drawn down the censure of the apostle. One effect of true repentance is to produce decided hatred of sin. It is not mere regret, or sorrow, it is positive hatred. There is a deep indignation against it as an evil and a bitter thing.<p>Yea, what fear - Fear lest the thing should be repeated. Fear lest it should not be entirely removed. Or it may possibly mean fear of the displeasure of Paul, and of the punishment which would be inflicted if the evil were not removed. But it more probably refers to the anxious state of mind that the whole evil might be corrected, and to the dread of having any vestige of the evil remaining among them.<p>Yea, what vehement desire - This may either mean their fervent wish to remove the cause of complaint, or their anxious desire to see the apostle. It is used in the latter sense in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>, and according to Doddridge and Bloomfield this is the meaning here. Locke renders it, "desire of satisfying me." It seems to me more probable that Paul refers to their anxious wish to remove the sin, since this is the topic under consideration. The point of his remarks in this verse is not so much their affection for him as their indignation against their sin, and their deep grief that sin had existed and had been tolerated among them.<p>Yea, what zeal - Zeal to remove the sin, and to show your attachment to me. They set about the work of reformation in great earnest.<p>Yea, what revenge! - Tyndale renders this: "it caused punishment." The idea is, that they immediately set about the work of inflicting punishment on the offender. The word used here (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  ekdike&#772;sis) probably denotes "maintenance of right, protection;" then it is used in the sense of avengement, or vengeance; and then of penal retribution or punishment; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-22.htm">Luke 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-14.htm">1 Peter 2:14</a>.<p>In all things ... - The sense of this is, "You have entirely acquitted yourselves of blame in this business." The apostle does not mean that none of them had been to blame, or that the church had been free from fault, for a large part of his former Epistle is occupied in reproving them for their faults in this business, but he means that by their zeal and their readiness to take away the cause of complaint, they had removed all necessity of further blame, and had pursued such a course as entirely to meet his approbation. They had cleared themselves of any further blame in this business, and had become, so far as this was concerned, "clear" (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;  hagnous) or pure. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

The apostle proceeds to describe godly sorrow by its effects, which are so many evidences of the sincerity and genuineness of it; some of the things mentioned are peculiar to the case of the Corinthians, and others common to evangelical repentance in any: <p>what carefulness it wrought in you; to remove the incestuous person from communion with them, which they were very negligent of before; to sin no more after this sort; to keep up, for the future, a more strict and regular discipline in the church; to perform good works in general, and not to offend God: <p>yea, what clearing of yourselves; not by denying the fact, or lessening, or defending it; but by acknowledging their neglect, praying it might be overlooked, declaring that they were not partakers of the sin; nor did they approve of it, but disliked and abhorred it, and were highly pleased with the method the apostle advised to: <p>yea, what indignation; not against the person of the offender, but against his sin; and not his only but their own too, in not appearing against him, and taking notice of him sooner; and particularly that they should act in such a manner, as to deserve the just rebuke of the apostle: <p>yea, what fear; not of hell and damnation, as in wicked men and devils, who repent not; but of God, and of grieving his ministers; and lest the corruption should spread in the church, as the apostle had suggested, "a little leaven leavens the whole lump"; <p>yea, what vehement desire; of seeing the apostle; of giving him full satisfaction; of behaving in quite another manner for the time to come; and to be kept from evil, and to honour God by a becoming conversation: <p>yea, what zeal; for God and his glory; for restoring the discipline of the church: for the doctrines of the Gospel; for the ordinances of Christ's house; for the supporting the character of the apostle, and other ministers of the word, against the false apostles: <p>yea, what revenge; not of persons in a private way, vengeance belongs to God; but of all disobedience, particularly that of the unhappy criminal among them, which has shown in the punishment inflicted on him by many: <p>in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter; of the incestuous person: it appeared plainly that they did not consent to, and approve of his sin; and though at first they were unconcerned about it, did not mourn over it as they ought, nor make such haste to deal with the offender as they should, yet having discovered true repentance for their sloth, negligence, and indulgence, they are acquitted, and stand, in the apostle's view of them, as if they had not offended. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge!

Bengel remarks that the six results mentioned by the Apostle fall into three pairs.

A beautiful passage in the 2d book of Aristotle’s Eth. Nicom. c. 5, furnishes an illustration, <span class="greekheb">ἡ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ ἀρετὴ τόν τε ὀφθαλμὸν σπουδαῖον ποιεῖ καὶ τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ὁμοίως ἡ τοῦ ἵππου ἀρετὴ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵππον τε σπουδαῖον ποιεῖ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀγαθὸν δραμεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. “The vigour of the eye renders both the eye and its action excellent, in like manner the vigour of the horse renders the horse excellent and well fitted for running,” etc.; so that <span class="greekheb">τὸ σπουδαῖον</span> is <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐ ἔχον</span>, and is opposed to <span class="greekheb">τῷ φαύλῳ</span>, ib. c. 4. Therefore <span class="greekheb">σπουδὴ</span> signifies <span class="ital">activity, diligence;</span> and in the present case expresses the principal characteristic of repentance, when it seriously enters into the soul, a characteristic which <span class="greekheb">καταφρονηταὶ</span>, <span class="ital">despisers</span>, are devoid of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-41.htm" title="Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it to you.">Acts 13:41</a>. Six special characteristics presently follow this ‘carefulness;’ and this one is again mentioned at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>. The same word is also at ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="Therefore, as you abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also....">2 Corinthians 8:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you....">2 Corinthians 8:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-22.htm" title="And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, on the great confidence which I have in you.">2 Corinthians 8:22</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ ἀπολογίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">but, clearing of yourselves</span>) <span class="ital">But</span> makes an emphatic addition [Epitasis]. Not only this, which I have said, <span class="ital">but</span> also, etc. Some of the Corinthians had behaved well, others not so well in that affair; or else even all in one respect had been blameless, in another, had been culpable; from which cause it was that various feelings arose. They had taken up the <span class="ital">clearing of themselves</span> [<span class="greekheb">ἀπολογίαν</span>, <span class="ital">self-defence</span>] and a feeling of <span class="ital">indignation</span>, in respect to themselves; they had <span class="ital">fear</span> and <span class="ital">vehement desire</span>, in respect to the apostle; <span class="ital">zeal</span> and <span class="ital">revenge</span>, in respect of him, who had been guilty of the sin. Comp. in this threefold respect <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>, note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>, note.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπολογίαν</span>, <span class="ital">clearing of yourselves</span> [<span class="ital">self-defence</span>]) inasmuch as you did not approve of the deed.—<span class="greekheb">ἀγανάκτησιν</span>, <span class="ital">indignation</span>) inasmuch as you did not instantly restrain it.—<span class="greekheb">ἀγανάκτησιν</span> is used here with admirable propriety.
