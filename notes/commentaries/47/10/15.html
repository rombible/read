He presses home the charge of intrusion. They, not he, were finding ground for their boasts in other men’s labours. The context leads, however, to the conclusion that it was a charge that had been brought against him. They had spoken of him as pushing on from point to point, as with a measureless ambition. Perhaps the fact that he had worked at Antioch, where the gospel had been preached by men of Cyprus and Cyrene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>), at Troas, where it had been preached by St. Luke (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-8.htm" title="And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.">Acts 16:8</a>), to the Romans whom he found at Corinth, and who, like Aquila and Priscilla, had been already converted (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>), were thought to give a colour to the charge that he was boasting in other men’s labours.<p><span class= "bld">Having hope, when your faith is increased.</span>—The verb is in the present tense, and should be translated, <span class= "ital">as your faith grows.</span> The words are spoken in the spirit of one—<p>“Nil actum reputans si quid superesset agendum”<p>[“Who thinks nought done while aught remains to do”]—<p>who seeks for fresh provinces to annex to the territory of his king. The growth of their faith will give him fresh courage, perhaps also fresh resources. But what does he mean by his “hope that we shall be enlarged according to” (or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">in relation to</span>) “our rule”? The words seem to imply something more than a mere extension of labours, and suggest the probability that in his journey to Jerusalem, with the large and liberal gifts of the Gentile churches, he had an intention, here half-avowed, to endeavour to modify the terms of the <span class= "ital">concordat</span> referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>, and to get the sanction of the Church of Jerusalem for his mission work at Rome: though there the gospel had been preached by others, and it was, primarily, at least, one of the Churches of the Circumcision. It will be seen that this supposition explains better than any other the apologetic tone of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/15-20.htm" title="Yes, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation:">Romans 15:20-29</a>. It was his reluctance even to appear to build on another man’s foundation that had hitherto kept him from them. He does not intend to appear, when he comes, in the character of the founder of this Church, or even as building the superstructure, but only as a friend, seeking mutual help and counsel. Spain is his goal. He takes Rome as a parenthesis. But he is going to Jerusalem, and he hopes that the difficulty which has hitherto hindered him will be removed.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:12-18 If we would compare ourselves with others who excel us, this would be a good method to keep us humble. The apostle fixes a good rule for his conduct; namely, not to boast of things without his measure, which was the measure God had distributed to him. There is not a more fruitful source of error, than to judge of persons and opinions by our own prejudices. How common is it for persons to judge of their own religious character, by the opinions and maxims of the world around them! But how different is the rule of God's word! And of all flattery, self-flattery is the worst. Therefore, instead of praising ourselves, we should strive to approve ourselves to God. In a word, let us glory in the Lord our salvation, and in all other things only as evidences of his love, or means of promoting his glory. Instead of praising ourselves, or seeking the praise of men, let us desire that honour which cometh from God only.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not boasting of things without our measure - There is here probably an allusion to the false teachers at Corinth. They had come after Paul had been there, and had entered into his labors. When he had founded the church; when he had endured trials and persecutions in order to reach Corinth; when he had labored there for a year and a half <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a>, they came and entered the quiet and easy field, formed parties. and claimed the field as their own. Paul says that he had not courage to do that; see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>. That required a species of boldness to which he could lay no claim; and he did not assume honor to himself like that.<p>That is, of other men's labors - Not intruding into churches which we did not establish, and claiming the right to direct their affairs, and to exclude the founders from all proper honors and all influence, and endeavoring to alienate the affections of Christians from their spiritual father and guide.<p>But having hope ... - So far from this; so far from a desire to enter into the labors of others and quietly enjoying the avails of their industry; and so far even from a desire to sit down ourselves and enjoy the fruit of our own labors, I desire to penetrate other untrodden regions; to encounter new dangers; to go where the gospel has not been planted, and to rear other churches there. I do not, therefore, make these remarks as if I wished even to dispossess the teachers that have entered into my labors. I make them because I wish to be aided by you in extending the gospel further; and I look to your assistance in order that I may have the means of going into the regions where I have not made known the name of the Redeemer.<p>When your faith is increased - When you become so strong as not to need my presence and my constant care; and when you shall be able to speed me on my way and to aid me on my journey. He expected to be assisted by them in his efforts to carry the gospel to other countries.<p>That we shall be enlarged - Margin, "Magnified by you." Bloomfield supposes that this means. "to gain fame and glory by you;" that is, as the teacher may justly by his pupils. So Robinson renders it. "to make great, to praise." But to me the idea seems to be that he wished them to enlarge or magnify him by introducing him to larger fields of action; by giving him a wider sphere of labor. It was not that he wished to be magnified by obtaining a wider reputation, not as a matter of praise or ambition, but he wished to have his work and success greatly enlarged. This he hoped to be enabled to do partly by the aid of the church at Corinth. When they became able to manage their own affairs; when his time was not demanded to superintend them; when their faith became so strong that his presence was not needed; and when they should assist him in his preparations for travel, then he would enter on his wider field of labor. He had no intention of sitting down in ease as the false teachers in Corinth seem disposed to have done.<p>According to our rule - Greek, "According our canon;" see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>. The sense is, according to the rule by which the sphere of his labors had been marked out. His rule was to carry the gospel as far as possible to the pagan world. He regarded the regions lying far beyond Corinth as coming properly within his limits; and he desired to occupy that field.<p>Abundantly - Greek, Unto abundance. So as to abound; that is, to occupy the field assigned as far as possible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. "Not boasting to unmeasured bounds (that is, not exceeding our own bounds by boasting) of (literally, 'in') other men's labors."<p>when&#8212;"As your faith goes on increasing." The cause of his not yet reaching with the Gospel the regions beyond Corinth, was the weakness as yet of their faith. He desired not to leave the Corinthians before the proper time, and yet not to put off preaching to others too long.<p>enlarged by you&#8212;Greek, "in your case." Our success in your case will give us an important step towards further progress beyond you (2Co 10:16).<p>according to our rule&#8212;according to our divinely assigned apportionment of the area or sphere of our work; for "we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure" (2Co 10:14).<p>abundantly&#8212;Greek, "unto exceeding abundance": so as to exceed the limits we have yet reached (2Co 10:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So that although we have boasted of you, we have not boasted <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">of things without our measure; </span> that is, of things that are not, or (as the apostle expounds himself) of things that were not done by him but by other men; for his line did reach unto them, and his labours had been employed and made successful amongst them. And he declares his hope, that when the gospel should have had its full success amongst them, and their <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">faith</span> should be <span class="bld">increased, </span>( either by the addition of more persons to the church amongst them, or by the perfecting of their faith, and other graces), they, who were apostles and the ministers of the gospel to them, should by it be magnified, or made great; to wit, by their means, who using much navigation, would have opportunities to comment the gospel, and the ministry of it, to other people, amongst whom they should come: wherein yet they should not exceed their rule; for though ordinary ministers be fixed in particular churches and places, yet the apostles’ rule was to go and preach the gospel over the whole world, being tied to no certain people or places. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Not boasting of things without our measure,.... The apostle here asserts what he had done before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm">2 Corinthians 10:13</a> with a view to explain it, as he does, saying, <p>that is of other men's labours; when they boasted of the Corinthians as their converts and children, whom they had begotten through the Gospel of Christ, they did not boast of other men's labours, as did the false apostles; who when they came to Corinth, found a church already planted by the apostle, and a multitude of believers, of whose conversion and faith he had been an instrument; and yet these men claimed them as their own, and an authority over them, when they were the fruit of the apostle's labours: <p>but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly; the sense is, that the apostle hoped, for he could not be sure, this lying in the secret will of God, that when the faith of the Corinthians was grown stronger, and more settled and established, and so would not stand in so much need of their care and instruction, they should be enlarged through their means; and that they should not stop here, but that the line, measure, or rule of their ministry, should be drawn to a greater length, and the bounds of it extended and carried abundantly further. The apostle intimates, that the weakness of their faith, and the disorders and divisions that were among them, were a hinderance to the spread of the Gospel; and that if their church state were in a better and a more settled condition, as it would give the apostles more leisure to preach the Gospel elsewhere, so it would serve to recommend it to other places beyond them; which would be an enlargement of the bounds of their ministry, and a means of magnifying of Christ and his Gospel, and of them also. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Not boasting of things <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> without <i>our</i> measure, <i>that is</i>, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</span><p>(m) As though God had divided the whole world among the apostles to be governed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,">2 Corinthians 10:15</a>.

This meaning Paul expresses figuratively, and that with faithful adherence to the figure used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you....">2 Corinthians 10:13-14</a>. He, namely, who <span class="ital">can work far off</span>, is a man of <span class="ital">great stature</span>, who without overstretching himself reaches afar; hence <span class="greekheb">μεγαλυνθῆναι</span>.[312] Further: because Paul still thinks of working <span class="ital">forth to distances indefinitely remote</span>, he hopes to become large <span class="greekheb">εἰς περισσείαν</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-5.htm" title="The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenty; but of every one that is hasty only to want.">Proverbs 21:5</a>). Still he knows that this wide working, on which he cherishes the hope of being able to enter, will be in keeping with the line drawn for him by God—<span class="ital">i.e.</span> the spatial limit divinely appointed for him—and thus will be no <span class="greekheb">ὑπερεκτείνειν ἑαυτ</span>.; hence <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν κανόνα ἡμῶν</span>,[313] which Beza ought not to have taken for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῷ ΚΑΝΌΝΙ ἩΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you.">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>). Further: the possibility of this wider working will not set in, <span class="ital">if the faith of the Corinthians does not grow</span>, namely, intensively, by <span class="ital">becoming always purer, firmer, and more living</span> than now, because Paul will not sooner be able to leave Corinth and travel onward; hence <span class="greekheb">αὐξανομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆν πίστεως ὑμῶν</span>,[314] so that thus—and what a wholesome impulse ought this to be to them—it is the Corinthians themselves, <span class="ital">among whom</span> he will see himself brought to the point of being able to extend his working further; hence <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>[315] <span class="greekheb">μεγαλυνθ</span>.: <span class="ital">among you to become large</span> in order to further abundant workin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς περισσείαν</span>] for Paul knew that he was destined to preach the gospel among all nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-14.htm" title="I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise....">Romans 1:14-15</a>, and see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-33.htm" title="Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.">Romans 15:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.">Acts 19:21</a>); hence beyond doubt he had already at that time the intention of proceeding by way of Rome to Spain. Thus in <span class="greekheb">μεγαλυνθῆναι</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς περισσείαν</span> the whole grand feeling of his apostolic destiny finds earnest and true expression. Rückert, on the contrary, sees a touch of <span class="ital">irony</span>, as if Paul would say: if the Corinthians would become a church as perfect as he wishes and expects, there will thence accrue a gain also for him; he, too, will then grow with them, and become capable not only of doing in the midst of them what is necessary, but also of doing yet something more, of growing, as it were, beyond the proper stature, etc. But both <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν κανόνα ἡμῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">εἰς περισσείαν</span> are at variance with the character of irony. If Paul had wished to express himself ironically, he would have written possibly <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν μεγαλυνθῆναι ὀλίγον</span> or the like, which would have expressed something different from what he properly meant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[312] <span class="greekheb">μεγαλ</span>. is by most taken as <span class="ital">celebrari</span>, which departs from the figure and hence is at variance with the context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-46.htm" title="And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,">Luke 1:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-13.htm" title="And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.">Acts 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-17.htm" title="And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.">Acts 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm" title="According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.">Php 1:20</a>). So Flatt, Billroth, and Ewald: “<span class="ital">to be exceedingly praised</span>, instead of being bitterly blamed,” to which <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κανόνα ἡμῶν</span> is not suitable. The whole figure demands the explanation <span class="ital">to become large</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-5.htm" title="But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,">Matthew 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-58.htm" title="And her neighbors and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy on her; and they rejoiced with her.">Luke 1:58</a>), and only thus does it stand in its right relation to, and bearing on, <span class="greekheb">αὐξανομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πιστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. Theodoret seems to have understood <span class="greekheb">μεγαλ</span>. rightly, since he explains it: <span class="greekheb">περαιτέρω πορευθῆναι</span>. Comp. Luther: “proceed further,” which explains the figurative expression no doubt, but does not translate it. Osiander understands under it an actual glorifying <span class="ital">of the office</span>,—that its influence, greatness, and glory shall become advanced. Hofmann: that the continuation of the preaching in the far West will make him still greater, whereby he will have still more ground for boasting—a view made impossible by the fact that <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> must be joined with <span class="greekheb">μεγαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. With all such interpretations the bold, concrete figure, which is set forth in <span class="greekheb">μεγαλυνθ</span>., is—in opposition to the connection—abandoned according to a subjective standard of taste, as if it were too strong and harsh. Erasmus in his <span class="ital">Annot</span>. (not in the <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.) aptly says: “Significat se sperare futurum ut in dies crescente fide Corinthiorum <span class="ital">creseat et ipse et major majorque fiat</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[313] Rückert, at variance with the context, understands under <span class="greekheb">κανών</span> here the apostle’s rule of not working where others had already wrought. See against this, ver. 13.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[314] Bengel rightly remarks on the <span class="ital">present</span> participle: “Paulus Corinthios neque ante tempus omittere voluit, neque alios diutius differre.” Olshausen erroneously thinks that Paul was waiting for the <span class="ital">completion</span> of faith among the Corinthians. The apostle rather means the <span class="ital">proportionate increase</span> of the faith of the readers, which hitherto had not attained such a degree of development as to make it possible for him to withdraw his working from them and extend the sphere of his activity further. This delicate reference of <span class="greekheb">αὐξανομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πίστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, which appeals to the whole sense of honour in the readers, and according to which Paul makes his further working at a distance <span class="ital">depend</span> on their Christian progress, is missed by Hofmann, who explains <span class="greekheb">αὐξανομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. merely in the sense of coincidence in time (<span class="ital">while</span> faith grows). This is bound up with his incorrect joining of <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> with <span class="greekheb">αὐξανομ</span>. See the following note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[315] This <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> is not, with Luther, Castalio, Beza, Mosheim, Billroth, de Wette, Hofmann, to be joined to <span class="greekheb">αὐξανομ</span>. (whereby either <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> at any rate, even with the meaning imported into it by Hofmann: “within your own sphere,” would seem very superfluous); nor yet is it to be taken as <span class="ital">per vos</span> (Erasmus, Grotius, Flatt), which only impairs the vividness and completeness of the figure, and in substance is already contained in <span class="greekheb">αὐξανομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πίστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,">2 Corinthians 10:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ εἰς τὰ ἄμετρα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">not glorying beyond our measure</span> (the argument is resumed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you.">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>), <span class="ital">that is, in other men’s labours</span>.
