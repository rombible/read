It is, of course, hard to convey the half-playful assonance in English. In “some that commend themselves” we note a reference to the charge of self-commending, which he has already noticed four times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.">2Corinthians 7:11</a>). Before he had defended himself against the charge; now he retorts it on his opponents. In “we dare” we trace a reference to the charge of cowardice, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.">2Corinthians 10:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Measuring themselves by themselves.</span>—The Greek MSS. present many various readings, some of the best MSS. omitting “are not wise, but,” and some giving “not boasting” for “we will not boast;” and the Greek text, on any reading, presents a grammatical difficulty, arising from the fact that the last word may be either the third person plural of a verb in the indicative present, or a participle in the dative case, agreeing with “themselves.” It is hardly necessary to discuss here the various possible constructions rising out of the combination of these phenomena. The English version gives, it is believed, substantially the meaning of the original. In the very act of saying, with a touch of irony, that he will not compare himself with the rival teachers, the Apostle virtually does compare himself. And the point he makes is that they instituted no such comparison. They were their own standards of excellence. Each was “<span class= "ital">amator sui sine rivali.</span>” Collectively, they formed what has been described in the language of modern literary history as a “Mutual Admiration Society.” Of all such self-admiration—one might almost say, of all such <span class= "ital">autolatry</span>—St. Paul declares, what the experience of all ages attests, that they who practise it “are not wise.” They lose, as the Greek verb more definitely expresses it, all power of discernment.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:12-18 If we would compare ourselves with others who excel us, this would be a good method to keep us humble. The apostle fixes a good rule for his conduct; namely, not to boast of things without his measure, which was the measure God had distributed to him. There is not a more fruitful source of error, than to judge of persons and opinions by our own prejudices. How common is it for persons to judge of their own religious character, by the opinions and maxims of the world around them! But how different is the rule of God's word! And of all flattery, self-flattery is the worst. Therefore, instead of praising ourselves, we should strive to approve ourselves to God. In a word, let us glory in the Lord our salvation, and in all other things only as evidences of his love, or means of promoting his glory. Instead of praising ourselves, or seeking the praise of men, let us desire that honour which cometh from God only.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we dare not make ourselves of the number - We admit that we are not bold enough for that. They had accused him of a lack of boldness and energy when present with them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>. Here in a strain of severe but delicate irony, he says he was not bold enough to do things which the had done. He did not dare to do the things which had been done among them. To such boldness of character, present or absent, he could lay no claim.<p>Or compare ourselves ... - I am not bold enough for that. That requires a stretch of boldness and energy to which I can lay no claim.<p>That commend themselves - That put themselves forward, and that boast of their endowments and attainments. It is probable that this was commonly done by those to whom the apostle here refers; and it is certain that it is everywhere the characteristic of pride. To do this, Paul says, required greater boldness than he possessed, and on this point he yielded to them the palm. The satire here is very delicate, and yet very severe, and was such as would doubtless be felt by them.<p>But they measuring themselves by themselves - Whitby and Clarke suppose that this means that they compare themselves with each other; and that they made the false apostles particularly their standard. Doddridge, Grotius, Bloomfield, and some others suppose the sense to be, that they made themselves the standard of excellence. They looked continually on their own accomplishments, and did not look at the excellences of others. They thus formed a disproportionate opinion of themselves, and undervalued all others. Paul says that he had not boldness enough for that. It required a moral courage to which he could lay no claim. Horace (Epis. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-7.htm">2 Corinthians 1:7</a>. 98) has an expression similar to this:<p>"Metirise quemque sue modulo ac pede verum est."<p>The sense of Paul is, that they made themselves the standard of excellence; that they were satisfied with their own attainments; and that they overlooked the superior excellence and attainments of others. This is a graphic description of pride and self-complacency; and, alas! it is what is often exhibited. How many there are, and it is to be feared even among professing Christians, who have no other standard of excellence than themselves. Their views are the standard of orthodoxy; their modes of worship are the standard of the proper manner of devotion; their habits and customs are in their own estimation perfect; and their own characters are the models of excellence, and they see little or no excellence in those who differ from them. They look on themselves as the true measure of orthodoxy, humility, zeal, and piety; and they condemn all others, however excellent they may be, who differ from them.<p>And comparing themselves ... - Or rather comparing themselves with themselves. Themselves they make to be the standard, and they judge of everything by that.<p>Are not wise - Are stupid and foolish. Because:<p>(1) They had no such excellence as to make themselves the standard.<p>(2) because this was an indication of pride.<p>(3) because it made them blind to the excellences of others. It was to be presumed that others had endowments not inferior to theirs.<p>(4) because the requirements of God, and the character of the Redeemer, were the proper standard of conduct. Nothing is a more certain indication of folly than for a man to make himself the standard of excellence. Such an individual must be blind to his own real character; and the only thing certain about his attainments is, that he is inflated with pride. And yet how common! How self-satisfied are most persons! How pleased with their own character and attainments! How grieved at any comparison which is made with others implying their inferiority! How prone to undervalue all others simply because they differ from them! - The margin renders this: "understand it not," that is, they do not understand their own character or their inferiority. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. "We do not presume (irony) to judge ourselves among, or in comparison with, some of them that commend themselves." The charge falsely brought against him of commending himself (2Co 3:1; 5:12), really holds good of the false teachers. The phrase, "judge ourselves of the number," is drawn from the testing of athletes and senators, the "approved" being set down on the roll [Wahl].<p>measuring themselves by themselves&#8212;"among themselves": to correspond to the previous verb, "judge ourselves among them." Instead of measuring themselves by the public standard, they measure themselves by one made by themselves: they do not compare themselves with others who excel them, but with those like themselves: hence their high self-esteem. The one-eyed is easily king among the blind.<p>are not wise&#8212;with all their boasted "wisdom" (1Co 1:19-26), they are anything but "wise."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This whole verse is a reflection upon the false teachers of the church of Corinth, from whose manners Paul purgeth himself. I (saith he) durst not, as some others, magnify myself, nor compare myself with those that do so. Neither is it any wisdom in them to contemn and despise others, in comparison of themselves; for observe what measures they take, they only measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves amongst themselves, that is, with birds of their own feather, such as are like unto themselves, and of their own faction and party; which no wise men would do. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For we dare not make ourselves of the number,.... Some understand this as spoken ironically, as if the apostle jeeringly should say, he would not pretend to join, or put himself upon a level, who was a poor, little, mean, despicable person, with such great men as the false apostles were, men of such large gifts, and of such great learning and eloquence; though they may be understood without an irony, that the modesty of the apostle and his fellow ministers would not suffer them to mingle with such persons, and act the vainglorious part they did: or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves; they were not so vain and foolish, as to give high encomiums of themselves, therefore would not boast even of the authority they had, and much less say that in letters, which they could not make good in fact: <p>but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise, or "understand not"; how foolish they are, how ridiculous they make themselves; they do not understand what they say, nor whereof they affirm; they do not understand themselves, what they really are; for to form a right judgment of themselves, they should have considered the gifts and abilities, the learning and knowledge of others, and thereby might have taken an estimate of their own; but instead of this, they only consulted themselves, and measured and compared themselves with themselves; which was acting just such a foolish part, as if a dwarf was to measure himself not with any kind of measure, or with another person, but with himself; only surveys himself, and his own dimensions, and fancies himself a giant. Just the reverse is this, to what is said in Philo the Jew (o), <p>"thn gar ouyeneian thn emautou metrein emayon, "I have learned to measure the nothingness of myself", and to contemplate thy exceeding great bounties; and moreover, perceive myself to be dust and ashes, or if there is any thing more abject.'' <p>(o) Quis rer. divin.

And according to these bounds he came even to them in preaching the Gospel of Christ, and trusts that he will go further, when they have so profited that he will not need to remain any longer among them to instruct them. And to this is added an amplification, in that he never followed the labours of other men.<p>(h) This is spoken in a taunting manner.<p>(i) Upon a vain persuasion that they have of themselves, they attribute to themselves anything at all.<p>(k) They condemn others, and measure all their doings only by themselves.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>.[305] Reason assigned for this assurance (<span class="greekheb">οἷοί ἐσμεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">τῷ ἔργῳ</span>): for we are not like our boastful opponents, but, etc. If we were such people as they are, word and work might doubtless not harmonize in our cas.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ τολμῶμεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">for we do not venture to number ourselves among, or compare ourselves with, certain people among those who commend themselves; but they</span>,[306] <span class="ital">measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not rational; we, on the other hand, will not make our boast beyond measure, but</span>, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you.">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>.

All these views take the participles for the finite tenses (or rather as <span class="ital">anacoluthic</span>); but against them all the following <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς δέ</span> is decisive, which makes it logically necessary to refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤΟΊ</span></span></span> to the <span class="ital">opponents</span>; for it cannot, as Emmerling and Olshausen think, form a logical contrast to the charge which is alleged to be implied in <span class="greekheb">οὐ συνιοῦσιν</span>, since <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜΕῖς ΔΈ</span></span></span> would require to be put in antithesis to the accusers, and not to the accusation (which, besides, would only be expressed quite cursorily and indirectly by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΣΥΝΙΟῦΣΙΝ</span></span></span>). Further, there may be urged against (<span class="ital">a</span>), that it would require <span class="greekheb">οὐ τοῖς συνιοῦσιν</span> with the article; against (<span class="ital">b</span>), that this interpretation is involved; against (<span class="ital">c</span>), not so much the want of the article—for <span class="greekheb">οὐ συνιοῦσιν</span> need not be in apposition, but might also be an accompanying definition of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΑΥΤΟῖς</span></span></span>—as the fact that there is no hint in the context of any ironical adducing of such a charge, and hence it is not to be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Would to God you could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.">2 Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-16.htm" title="I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.">2 Corinthians 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For you suffer fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.">2 Corinthians 11:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing.">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[305] This passage is most thoroughly discussed by Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Dissert</span>.

Theodoret remarks: <span class="greekheb">ἀσαφῶς απαν τὸ χώρημα τοῦτο γέγραφεν</span>, and for this he advances as a reason: <span class="greekheb">ἐναργῶς ἐλέγξαι τοὺς αἰτίους οὐ βουλόμενος</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[306] This emphasized <span class="ital">they</span> (<span class="greekheb">αὐτοί</span>, <span class="ital">they on their part</span>) is fully justified in contrast to the following <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span>; hence it is not, with Osiander, to be taken in the sense of <span class="ital">soli</span>, n its limitation to themselves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[307] The objects compared may be of <span class="ital">similar</span> or <span class="ital">dissimilar nature</span>. On this point the <span class="ital">word</span> does not determine anything.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[308] Such an one thinks: what a great man I am, for how much I know and can do! how I even excel myself, etc.! His own <span class="ital">ego</span> is thus <span class="ital">object and canon</span> of the measuring and judging. Calvin aptly illustrates this by the example of the ignorant and yet so conceited monks. The juxtaposition of <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἑαυτούς</span> <span class="ital">palliates</span> the conceit of the selfish nature. Comp. Plato, <span class="ital">Protag</span>. p. 347 E: <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ δʼ ἑαυτοῖς σύνεισι διʼ ἑαυτῶν</span>. It is well paraphrased by Reiche, p 380: “sibi ipsis e vana sua de se opinione virtutum meritorumque modulum constituentes atque se sibi solis comparantes, non potioribus meliusque meritis, quod si fecerint, illico quam sint nihil ipsi cognoscerent.” Hofmann, again, deals in subtleties, referring <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτοῖς</span> not only to the first, but also to the second participle, and (see against this, below) connecting the concluding <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῖς</span> with the following verb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[309] According to Emmerling, <span class="greekheb">μετρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτ</span>. applies to abstinence from promises which transcend their powers, and the <span class="greekheb">συγκριν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῖς</span> to the “judicium ferre de se ad normam virium suarum, factorum et meritorum.” According to Olshausen, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἑαυτοὺς μετροῦντες</span> is intended to mean: we measure ourselves <span class="ital">by what the Lord has imposed on us!</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Against our explanation (which is found in substance also in Augustine, Chrysostom 1, Theodoret, Theophylact, Luther, Calvin, Hammond, Wetstein, Zachariae, and others, including Rückert, Reiche, Neander, Osiander, Kling, partly also in Hofmann), it has been objected (see especially Fritzsche and Billroth) that <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. cannot apply to the opponents, because manifestly different <span class="ital">modes of dealing</span>, and not different <span class="ital">persons</span>, would be opposed to each other, in which case Paul could not but have written: <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς γὰρ οὐ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. But by this very contrast of <span class="ital">persons</span> first introduced by <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς δέ</span>) the opposite of the <span class="ital">mode of action</span> previously negatived is exhibited in a truly concrete and vivid way, and by no means illogically, seeing that in fact by the previous <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοὺς τισί</span> the contrast of persons introduced with <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> was very naturally suggested. On the other hand, it would not have been logical, if Paul had written <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς γὰρ οὐ τολμῶμεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., since then doubtless the <span class="ital">persons</span>, but not <span class="ital">that which is asserted</span> of the persons, would stand in logical contrast with one another; for what is asserted would need to be substantially in both clauses <span class="ital">one and the same</span> thing, which would be denied of the <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span>, and affirmed of the <span class="greekheb">αὐτοί</span>. It has been objected to our explanation of <span class="greekheb">οὐ συνιοῦσιν</span> that it is against the context; but it is, in point of fact, to be observed, that on the one hand it gives a very delicate explanation concerning the ironical <span class="greekheb">οὐ τολμῶμεν</span>, and that on the other hand the following <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς δὲ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. with logical accuracy opposes to the previous <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. the thought: we, however, abide by the measure which <span class="ital">God</span> has imparted to us, so that in <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸ μέτρον τοῦ κανόνος</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὗ ἐμέρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεὸς μέτρου</span> there lies the contrast to the irrational procedure of the opponents measuring themselves <span class="ital">by themselves</span>. He who measures himself by himself, seeing that in fact he lacks an objective standard, falls with his boasting <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὰ ἄμετρα</span>, like those opponents; but not he, who knows himself determined by a limit set by God. Finally, the objection, that by our interpretation <span class="greekheb">οὐ συνιοῦσιν</span> gets a thought imported into it which its literal tenor does not actually present (Hofmann), is quite groundless, since <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>, by a quite common usage, turns the <span class="greekheb">συνιοῦσιν</span> into its opposite, consequently <span class="greekheb">οὐ συν</span>. expresses the <span class="greekheb">ἀσυνεσία</span>, the irrationality and folly of those men in their procedure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By leaving out oh <span class="greekheb">οὐ συνιοῦσιν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς δέ</span>, but retaining <span class="greekheb">καυχησόμεθα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you.">2 Corinthians 10:13</a> (see the critical remarks), the meaning results; “<span class="ital">sed me ex meo modulo metiens mihique me conferens, non praeter modum, sed ad modum ita mihi praefiniti spatii, ut ad vos quoque pervenirem, gloriabor</span>” (Fritzsche).[310] But if <span class="greekheb">καυχησόμεθα</span> also is left out, as Fritzsche and Billroth approve, Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,">2 Corinthians 10:15</a> turns back to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ΕἸς ΤᾺ ἌΜΕΤΡΑ</span></span></span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you.">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>, and then adds the still necessary verb anacoluthically in the participle: “<span class="ital">sed me ipse mihi conferens, non praeter modum</span> … <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,">2 Corinthians 10:15</a>, <span class="ital">non praeter modum inquam me efferens</span>” (Fritzsche). The suitableness of the meaning and of the antithetic character in the several parts, as well as the unexceptionable warrant of the anacoluthon, have been aptly shown by Fritzsche, pp. 41, 43 f. But the rejected words cannot thereby be deprived of their critical title to exist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[310] Comp.

This sentence is so much involved, that it is not surprising to find the Western authorities (see crit. note) giving it a quite different turn by the omission of the words <span class="greekheb">οὐ συνιοῦσιν</span> (or <span class="greekheb">συνιᾶσιν</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς δὲ</span> … <span class="greekheb">καυχησόμεθα</span>. Following this shorter text, the meaning would be: “but we are measuring ourselves by ourselves and comparing ourselves with ourselves, not going into spheres beyond our measure,” etc. This gives a connected sense, and is favoured by the fact that the balance of the sentence leads us to expect that <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ</span> after <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ</span> shall refer to the Apostle, and not to his opponents, as it must do with the longer reading. Nevertheless we believe that the omission is simply an attempt to evade the difficulty of the true text; it would be quite unlike St. Paul to speak of <span class="ital">himself</span> as his own standard of conduct, and would not be harmonious with the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you.">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>. Others take <span class="greekheb">συνιοῦσιν</span> as a dative participle and adopt the rendering: “but we (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, St. Paul) measure ourselves by ourselves, and compare ourselves with ourselves, unwise as we are” (<span class="ital">sc.</span>, in their opinion). This, however, is not only open to the objection just mentioned, but would require <span class="greekheb">τοῖς</span> before <span class="greekheb">οὐ συνιοῦσιν</span>. On the whole, therefore, we prefer to follow the best MS. authority by reading <span class="greekheb">συνιᾶσιν</span>, and to treat the Western text as an abbreviation, which misses the point of the argument in the attempt to simplify the construction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>12. <span class="ital">For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves</span>] i.e. ironically, <span class="ital">we dare not venture to number or compare ourselves</span> with certain persons who have of late been claiming great authority among you. After St Paul’s manner (see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-13.htm" title="For we write none other things to you, than what you read or acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end;">2 Corinthians 1:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>) there is a play upon words here, which is difficult to translate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">commend themselves</span>] As has been said, the Greek word here used has in the N. T. the sense of <span class="ital">praise</span>; but probably here the leading idea as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a> is of <span class="ital">recommending</span> themselves, by such means as are indicated in chapters 1–3 of the first Epistle, and of having their own selfish objects in view in so doing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but they measuring themselves</span>] The idea suggested by the A.V. is of men whose motives are centred in self. They judge themselves by their own standard, they take advantage of other men’s labours, they even, St Paul seems to hint (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.">2 Corinthians 10:16</a></span>), boast of other men’s labours, they give other men no credit for what they have done. And all this, like the Galatian teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.">Galatians 4:17</a>), that they may occupy the principal place in the Corinthian Church. There is another reading here, however, which is accepted by many editors and preferred by Dean Stanley, which gives an entirely different turn to the sentence. Omitting the words ‘<span class="ital">are not wise, but we</span>’ the passage runs, ‘<span class="ital">but measuring ourselves by ourselves, and comparing ourselves with ourselves, we do not boast beyond measure</span>.’ This reading may have been caused by the transcriber’s eye passing from <span class="greekheb">ΟΥΣ</span> to <span class="greekheb">ΟΥΚ</span> in the Greek, and omitting the intervening words, while it is difficult to see how St Paul can describe himself as avoiding the danger of boasting beyond measure by the very process which experience shews to be the commonest mode of causing such boasting, namely by taking oneself as the sole standard of comparison. And the testimony of MSS. and versions is much in favour of the received text. See however next note but two.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by themselves</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">in</span> themselves, i.e. if we accept the A.V., having their thoughts perpetually turned inwards in complacent self-contemplation. Meyer quotes the expression <span class="ital">Metiri suo modulo</span> from Horace <span class="ital">Ep</span>. 1. 7. 98.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">amongst themselves</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">with</span> themselves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">are not wise</span>] These words are omitted by the Vulgate and Wiclif. It must be confessed that they are not in the Apostle’s manner, and that they have a suspicious appearance of having been inserted to fill up some supposed deficiency in the sense. But see last note but two. If we omit them, together with the words ‘But we’ in the next verse, the Apostle’s meaning will be, ‘We do not compare ourselves with some who have lately appeared among you. We keep within the bounds of our own labours, of the work that God has marked out for us. We do not ‘build on another man’s foundation’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm" title="Yes, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation:">Romans 15:20</a>) or challenge comparison by intruding into another man’s sphere of work.’ See also <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,...">2 Corinthians 10:15-16</a></span>. The balance of probability, in spite of the difficulties enumerated above, is in favour of this reading. St Paul seems to imply that he avoids <span class="ital">all</span> comparison by keeping within his own bounds.

The reading, however, of the Authorized Version is undoubtedly right, and most probably the rendering also. The meaning is that the little cliques of factious religionists, never looking outside their own narrow circles, became inflated with a sense of importance which would have been annihilated if they had looked at higher standards. Hence they thought themselves at liberty to intrude and lay down the law and usurp a claim to infallibility which there was nothing to justify. Such conduct is the reverse of wise. It is a mixture of selfishness, Pharisaism, and conceit, and there have been abundant examples of it among religious parties in all ages. St. Paul, on the other hand, keeps within his own measure, because he has learnt to adopt larger and loftier standards. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Make ourselves of the number (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., better, to number ourselves.
