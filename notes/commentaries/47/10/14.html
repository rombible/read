And this is obviously St. Paul’s meaning. “We were the first to come,” he says, “as working within our limits; the very fact that we did so come being a proof of it.” They (his rivals) came afterwards, and were intruders. On Corinth, as the then limit of his work, see Note on the preceding verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/10-14.htm" title="For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not to you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:...">2 Corinthians 10:14-16</a>. </span><span class="ital">We stretch not, </span>&c. — In preaching at Corinth, we do not, like the false teacher, go out of our line, as <span class="ital">not reaching to you; but we are come </span>even <span class="ital">as far as you </span>— By a gradual, regular process, having taken the intermediate places in our way. The apostles themselves, (unless they received particular direction to that purpose, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,...">Acts 16:6-7</a>,) “were not at liberty to preach in some countries, and pass by others. St. Paul, therefore, following this rule, preached in all the countries of the Lesser Asia, beginning at Jerusalem. From Asia he passed into Macedonia, where he preached in many of the chief cities. Then he preached in Greece, and particularly at Athens; and at last came to Corinth, in a regular course of preaching the gospel, where it had not been preached before.” <span class="ital">Not </span>— Like those whom I have had so much reason to complain of; <span class="ital">boasting of things without, </span>or beyond, <span class="ital">our </span>proper <span class="ital">measure </span>— Not intruding into churches planted by <span class="ital">other men’s labours </span>— Where we have no natural and proper call. “The apostle justly considered the false teacher’s coming, and establishing himself in the Corinthian church, as one of its ordinary pastors, and his assuming the direction of that church, in opposition to him, as an unlawful intrusion; because that church having been planted by St. Paul, the edification and direction of it belonged only to him, and the bishops and deacons ordained by him. Besides, this intruder, by pretending to more knowledge than the apostle, and by assuming an authority superior to his, endeavoured to draw the Corinthians from following his doctrines and precepts.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">But having hope, when your faith is increased</span> — And I can leave you to the care of your ordinary teachers; to be <span class="ital">by you enlarged according to our rule </span>— That is, with respect to our line of preaching; <span class="ital">abundantly. To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you </span>— The apostle hoped that the believers at Corinth would soon be so well instructed in the doctrines of the gospel, and so confirmed in the faith, as to render it proper for him to leave them to the care of others; and to go and preach the gospel in the countries beyond them, where the gospel had not been preached, namely, in the regions of Italy and Spain, whither we know he intended to go. For in Laconia, Arcadia, and the other countries of Peloponnesus, which composed the Roman province of Achaia, he had already preached the gospel, as is plain from the inscription of both his letters to the Corinthians. <span class="ital">And not to boast in another man’s line </span>— Or province, marked out, as it were, by a line; <span class="ital">of things made ready to our hand </span>— As some, who are very solicitous about their own case, affect to do, and then pride themselves in sowing the ground which others had cleared. As the apostle here contrasts his own behaviour with that of the false teacher, we may infer, from what he says, that that teacher took to himself great praise for having instructed the Corinthians more perfectly than, he said, Paul had done, and for having regulated the affairs of the church, which he pretended had been left in disorder by the apostle.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:12-18 If we would compare ourselves with others who excel us, this would be a good method to keep us humble. The apostle fixes a good rule for his conduct; namely, not to boast of things without his measure, which was the measure God had distributed to him. There is not a more fruitful source of error, than to judge of persons and opinions by our own prejudices. How common is it for persons to judge of their own religious character, by the opinions and maxims of the world around them! But how different is the rule of God's word! And of all flattery, self-flattery is the worst. Therefore, instead of praising ourselves, we should strive to approve ourselves to God. In a word, let us glory in the Lord our salvation, and in all other things only as evidences of his love, or means of promoting his glory. Instead of praising ourselves, or seeking the praise of men, let us desire that honour which cometh from God only.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure - In coming to preach to you we have not gone beyond the proper limits assigned us.

They did not go beyond the bounds set them by the purpose and providence of God, by going to Corinth; nor did they boast of things without their measure, when they spoke of their labours, and of the success of their ministrations among them; nor did they assume and arrogate to themselves what did not belong to them, when they claimed an authority over them, and a right of exercising their apostolical office among them: <p>as though we reached not unto you; by right, or according to the will of God, and the measuring line and bounds he drew and fixed for them: <p>for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the Gospel of Christ. The case is clear, it is a plain matter of fact, that they were not only come to other places, where they had preached the Gospel, and planted churches, but as far as to Corinth also, where they came "in, by, or with the Gospel of Christ": not their own, or what was of their own invention, but Christ's; of which he is the author, minister, and subject; they did not come without something with them; they came with the good news and glad tidings of salvation by Christ; they came preaching the Gospel, which was owned for the conversion of many souls, and for the raising a very considerable church; all which was a full proof that they were of right, and not by usurpation, come to them; that they had not thrusted themselves in, where they had no business, and consequently still retained a power over them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-14.htm" title="For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not to you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:">2 Corinthians 10:14</a>.

Paul abides by his figure: for if he were not <span class="ital">destined</span> to extend his official working even to Corinth, and yet <span class="ital">wished</span> to do so, he would resemble a man who stretches himself beyond the boundary-line drawn for him, in order to reach to a point that lies beyond the limits which he is forbidden to overpas.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς μὴ ἐφικν</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὑμᾶς</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐφικν</span>. is to be taken in no other sense than the previous <span class="greekheb">ἐφικέσθαι</span>.
