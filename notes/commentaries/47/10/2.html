We should be aware of our own infirmities, and think humbly of ourselves, even when men reproach us. The work of the ministry is a spiritual warfare with spiritual enemies, and for spiritual purposes. Outward force is not the method of the gospel, but strong persuasions, by the power of truth and the meekness of wisdom. Conscience is accountable to God only; and people must be persuaded to God and their duty, not driven by force. Thus the weapons of our warfare are very powerful; the evidence of truth is convincing. What opposition is made against the gospel, by the powers of sin and Satan in the hearts of men! But observe the conquest the word of God gains. The appointed means, however feeble they appear to some, will be mighty through God. And the preaching of the cross, by men of faith and prayer, has always been fatal to idolatry, impiety, and wickedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That I may not be bold - I entreat you so to act that I may not have occasion to exercise the severity which I fear I shall be compelled to use against those who accuse me of being governed wholly by worldly motives and policy.

The charge was, probably, that he was not governed by high and holy principles, but by the principles of mere worldly policy; that he was guided by personal interests, and by worldly views - by ambition, or the love of dominion, wealth, or popularity, and that he was destitute of every supernatural endowment and every evidence of a divine commission. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

That is, he entreated them that they would so behave for the future, that he might have no occasion, when he came among them, to use that power and authority they called boldness, which he had received from Christ for edification, and not destruction; as for that asperity and roughness with which he wrote, and which was thought to be too severe, it was in order to reclaim them, and so prevent that sharpness he was empowered by Christ to use: for though he had said in his former epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a> "shall I come unto you with a rod or in love? and in the spirit of meekness?" he chose to come in the latter, rather than with the former; namely, not <p>with that confidence wherewith, says he, <p>I think to be bold: by "confidence" he means the faith of miracles he was possessed of, and particularly the power he, and other apostles had, of striking dead or blind incorrigible offenders, or of delivering them to Satan to undergo some corporeal punishment; which he had been thinking of, and reasoning about in his own mind, and was almost come to a conclusion concerning it, to inflict it upon, and with it to be bold, <p>against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh; who not barely thought so within themselves, but reasoned the matter with others, and would fain persuade them to believe that they did walk in a carnal manner; not that they had the face to say, that they walked after the dictates of corrupt nature, or lived in open vice and profaneness; but that they walked in craftiness, had their conversation in the world with fleshly wisdom, seeking their own worldly interest and secular advantage; which is denied by the apostle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a> and was the real case, and true picture of the false teachers themselves. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But I beseech <i>you</i>, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> according to the flesh.</span><p>(b) As though I had no other aid and help than that which outwardly I seem to have: and therefore Paul contrasts his flesh, that is, his weak condition and state, with his spiritual and apostolic dignity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.">2 Corinthians 10:2</a>. After the previous relative clause, the <span class="greekheb">παρακαλῶ</span> is in substance resumed by means of <span class="greekheb">δέομαι δέ</span>, and that in such a way that <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> has its adversative reference in the contents of the relative clause (Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell.</span> I. p. 174; Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar.</span> p. 377), and the <span class="greekheb">δέομαι</span> now substituted for <span class="greekheb">παρακαλῶ</span> betrays the increasing earnestness softened by the mention of Christ’s gentleness and meekness. Emmerling and Rückert refer <span class="greekheb">δέομαι</span> not to the Corinthians, but to <span class="ital">God</span>: “but I pray God that I when present may not be obliged to act with the confidence and boldness,” etc. So also Ewald and Hofmann. But how strangely Paul would have written, if he had left his <span class="greekheb">παρακαλῶ ὑμᾶς</span> to stand quite abruptly at the very beginning of the new address! It is all the more arbitrary not to refer <span class="greekheb">δέομαι</span> also to the readers, and not to be willing to supply a <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> with <span class="greekheb">δέομαι</span> from the previous <span class="greekheb">παρακαλῶ ὑμᾶς</span>.

This general interpretation is not at variance with the context, since, in fact, a <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα περιπατεῖν</span> would have shown such a demeanour in the apostle’s position as his opponents blamed him for,—bold at a distance, timid when near, full of the fear of men and of the desire to please men.

To say this of St. Paul was to charge him with being insincere and not disinterested. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>But I beseech you (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;)<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834; is used for beseech. It is doubtful whether the two words can be strictly distinguished as indicating different degrees of feeling. It may be said that &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; and its kindred noun &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; are frequently used of prayer to God, while &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834; occurs only twice in this sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-8.htm">2 Corinthians 12:8</a>. On the other hand, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834; is used of God's pleading with men, while in the same passage &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is used of men's entreating men; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>. Rev., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>, renders entreat, which, according to older English usage, is the stronger word, meaning to prevail by entreaty, just as persuade, which originally meant to use persuasion, now signifies to prevail by persuasion.<p>The construction of the passage is difficult. Literally it is: I pray the not showing courage when present, with the confidence, etc. The sense is: I pray you that you may not make it necessary for me to show, when I am present, that official peremptoriness which I am minded to show against those who charge me with unworthy motives.<p>May not be bold - think to be bold (&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>The A.V. thus misses the distinction between the two verbs. The former signifies to be stout-hearted or resolutely confident in view of one's conscious strength or capacity; the latter, to carry this feeling into action; to dare. The distinction is not easy to represent by single English words. It might be approximately given by brave and bold, though, in common usage, this distinction practically disappears. &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; does not so much emphasize fearlessness as the tore positive quality of cheerful confidence in the presence of difficulty and danger, the sense which appears in the earlier usage of brave as gay (see the various uses in Shakespeare). Hence Rev. is on the right line in the use of courage, from cor heart, through the French coeur. Rev. renders, show courage - be bold. In classical Greek, the kindred noun &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is sometimes, though not often, used in a bad sense, audacity, as in Homer, where Minerva is rebuking Mars for exciting strife among the gods with stormy or furious courage (&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; "Iliad," xxi., 395). So the reckless daring of Hector is described &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; the effrontery of a fly ("Iliad," xvii., 570). </body></html>
