The meaning is, that the false teachers, in their conversations among themselves, measured or estimated themselves not according to their real worth, but according to the opinion which they had formed of themselves. They looked continually on themselves, surveying their own great imaginary qualifications, but not considering the vastly superior abilities of many others; and so formed a disproportionate opinion of themselves. And this is everywhere one of the greatest sources of pride.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:7-11 In outward appearance, Paul was mean and despised in the eyes of some, but this was a false rule to judge by.

Let them feel that all which has been threatened will be certainly executed unless there is repentance. Paul here designedly contradicts the charge which was made against him; and means to say that all that he had threatened in his letters would he certainly executed unless there was a reform. I think that the evidence here is clear that Paul does not intend to admit what they said about his bodily presence to be true; and most probably all that has been recorded about his deformity is mere fable. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. think this&#8212;"consider this."<p>such will we be&#8212;or "are," in general, not merely shall we be at our next visit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I would have no such person think so of me, for he shall find me the same in deed when I come, that I have spoken myself to be by my letters.

The apostle seems to have in view some one particular person, though he does not choose to name him, who had more especially reproached him after this manner; and who was either one of the members of this church, or rather one of the false apostles: and so in the foregoing verse, instead of "say they", in which way both the Syriac and Vulgate Latin read, and is followed in our version, it is in the original text  "says he", or "he says"; and so a certain particular person seems designed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-4.htm">2 Corinthians 11:4</a> whom the apostle would have to know and conclude with himself, and of which he might fully assure himself, that such as we are in word by letters, when we are absent, such will be also in deed, when we are present: he threatens the calumniator, that he should find him, to his sorrow, the same man present as absent; that what he sent by letters, should be found to be fact, when he came again; whose coming would not be with all that tenderness and gentleness, as when he first preached the Gospel to them, for which there was then a reason; since he and others had swerved from the truths of the Gospel, and the right ways of God, which would require the severity he threatened them with, and the execution of which might be depended upon. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.">2 Corinthians 10:11</a>.

Not only did they deny his Apostolic authority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>), not only did they ridicule his appearance, but they even charged him with the grossest cowardice. For nothing is more contemptible than to utter loud threats when at a distance, and to subside into silence and meekness when confronted with an adversary.
