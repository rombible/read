In the word “approved” there is possibly a reference to what had been said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.">1Corinthians 11:19</a>. He had meant something more by it than meeting with men’s approval.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:12-18 If we would compare ourselves with others who excel us, this would be a good method to keep us humble. The apostle fixes a good rule for his conduct; namely, not to boast of things without his measure, which was the measure God had distributed to him. There is not a more fruitful source of error, than to judge of persons and opinions by our own prejudices. How common is it for persons to judge of their own religious character, by the opinions and maxims of the world around them! But how different is the rule of God's word! And of all flattery, self-flattery is the worst. Therefore, instead of praising ourselves, we should strive to approve ourselves to God. In a word, let us glory in the Lord our salvation, and in all other things only as evidences of his love, or means of promoting his glory. Instead of praising ourselves, or seeking the praise of men, let us desire that honour which cometh from God only.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For not he that commendeth himself ... - Not he who boasts of his talents and endowments. He is not to be judged by the estimate which he shall place on himself, but by the estimate which God shall form and express.<p>Is approved - By God. It is no evidence that we shall be saved that we are prone to commend ourselves; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-10.htm">Romans 16:10</a>.<p>But whom the Lord commendeth - see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>. The idea here is, that people are to be approved or rejected by God. He is to pass judgment on them, and that judgment is to be in accordance with his estimate of their character, and not according to their own. If he approves them they will be saved; if he does not, vain will be all their empty boasting; vain all their reliance on their wealth, eloquence. learning, or earthly honors. None will save them from condemnation; not all these things can purchase for them eternal life. Paul thus seriously shows that we should be mainly anxious to obtain the divine favor. It should be the grand aim and purpose of our life; and we should repress all disposition for vain - glory or self-confidence; all reliance on our talents, attainments, or accomplishments for salvation. our boast is that we have such a redeemer: and in that we all may glory!<p>Remarks<p>1. We should have no desire to show off any special boldness or energy of character which we may have; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>. We should greatly prefer to evince the gentleness and meekness of Christ. Such a character is in itself of far more value than one that is merely energetic and bold; that is rash, authoritative, and fond of display.<p>2. They who are officers in the church should have no desire to administer discipline; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-2.htm">2 Corinthians 10:2</a>. Some people are so fond of power that they always love to exercise it. They are willing to show it even by inflicting punishment on others; and "dressed in a little brief authority" they are constantly seeking occasion to show their consequence; they magnify trifles; they are unwilling to pass by the slightest offences. The reason is not that they love the truth, but that they love their own consequence, and they seek every opportunity to show it.<p>3. All Christians and all Christian ministers are engaged in a warfare; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-3.htm">2 Corinthians 10:3</a>. They are at war with sin in their own hearts, and with sin wherever it exists on earth, and with the powers of darkness. With foes so numerous and so vigilant, they should not expect to live a life of ease or quietness. Peace, perfect peace, they may expect in heaven, not on earth. Here they are to fight the good fight of faith and thus to lay held on eternal life. It has been the common lot of all the children of God to maintain such a war, and shall we expect to be exempt?<p>"Shall I be carried to the skies.<p>On flowery beds of ease,<p>While others fought to win the prize,<p>And sailed through bloody seas?<p>"Are there no foes for me to face,<p>Must I not stem the flood?<p>Is this vile world a friend to grace,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

A metaphor from testing metals (Ro 16:10; 1Co 11:19).

No man is approved of God for his speaking well of himself; the business is, who they are who approve themselves in the work which God hath committed to them; to whom the Lord will say: Well done, good and faithful servants: to whom the apostle refers both himself, and those who magnified themselves, but vilified him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For not he that commendeth himself is approved,.... Such may be said to commend themselves, who ascribe that to themselves, which do not belong to them; as that they are the ministers of Christ, and sent forth by him, when they are not; who boast that they have large ministerial gifts, when they have none; and of their great service and usefulness, when it is all the produce of other men's labours; and what they have and do, they wholly impute to their own power and industry, and not to the grace and power of God: now such persons are neither approved by God, nor good men; for their own self-commendation stands for nothing, and is so far from being acceptable to God or men, that it must be nauseous and disagreeable; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>. <p>But whom the Lord commendeth: they are approved by God and men, and they are such whom he highly honours, as he did Paul, by counting them faithful; and putting them into the ministry, by qualifying them for his service, by assisting them in it, and making them abundantly useful for the good of souls, and the glory of his name: by all which he bears a testimony to them, and shows his approbation of them, and at last will say, well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of thy Lord. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>18. <span class="ital">For not he that commendeth himself is approved</span>] St Paul’s self-commendation is only wrung from him by circumstances. The Corinthians will not judge of things except ‘after the appearance’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.">2 Corinthians 10:7</a></span>). St Paul, bearing in mind the wise man’s advice to ‘answer a fool according to his folly’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-5.htm" title="Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.">Proverbs 26:5</a>), shews that even from that point of view the new teachers could not arrogate to themselves any superiority over him. But he takes care to remark that the only true ground of approval is to do the work of God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But whom the Lord commendeth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>).  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
