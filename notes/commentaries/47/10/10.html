Here, for the first time, we have the very words quoted. The scorn conveyed in them had wounded the Apostle’s sensitive nature like a poisoned arrow; and we have here the nearest approach which the New Testament presents to the passionate complaints poured forth by some of the Psalmists of the Old (Psalms 69, 109). We note the common element of a burning indignation under the sense of wrong. We note also the absence from the Apostle’s feelings of the maledictory element which is so prominent in theirs. The “meekness and gentleness of Christ” had not been without their effect in tempering even the most vehement emotions.<p>The great majority of MSS. give the verb in the singular: “For his letters, <span class= "ital">saith he . . .</span>” This may be taken, like the French <span class= "ital">on dit,</span> as used impersonally, and possibly this is the meaning which the English version was intended to convey. The context, however, the definite “such a man as that” of the next verse, is obviously decisive. St. Paul has in his thoughts here, and through the rest of the chapter, one conspicuous antagonist,—the head of a clique and cabal of opponents.<p><span class= "bld">His bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</span>—As with other antithetical epigrams, the sting was found in the tail. It would seem all but incredible that any doubt could ever have been expressed as to the fact that the words point to physical infirmities. They can, indeed, refer to nothing else. For the tradition as to the Apostle’s personal appearance, see <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of the Acts of the Apostles. The “contemptible speech” (literally, <span class= "ital">speech of no value; counted as nought</span>) may refer either to a weak or unmusical voice, or to the absence of the rhetorical artifices, the exordium, divisions, perorations, in which Greek audiences delighted. It may be noted that these words give a fresh significance to a remarkable passage in an Epistle written, in the judgment of many critics, within a few weeks of this. “You,” he says to the Galatians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-13.htm" title="You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.">Galatians 4:13-14</a>), “though I came to you with that infirmity of the flesh which others sneer at, the chronic trial of my life, you did not contemn” (the self-same verb as that used here) “nor loathe me.” There is manifestly a contrast present to his thoughts between the mean insults of his rivals at Corinth and the affection which the Galatians had once manifested, and which made their subsequent alienation all the more painful to him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:7-11 In outward appearance, Paul was mean and despised in the eyes of some, but this was a false rule to judge by. We must not think that none outward appearance, as if the want of such things proved a man not to be a real Christian, or an able, faithful minister of the lowly Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For his letters - The letters which he has sent to the church when absent. Reference is had here probably to the First Epistle to the Corinthians. They might also have seen some of Paul's other epistles, and been so well acquainted with them as to he able to make the general remark that he had the power of writing in an authoritative and impressive manner.<p>Say they - Margin, "Said he." Greek (&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd;  phe&#772;sin) in the singular. This seems to have referred to some one person who had uttered the words - perhaps some one who was the principal leader of the faction opposed to Paul.<p>Are weighty and powerful - Tyndale renders this: "Sore and strong." The Greek is, "heavy and strong" (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;  bareiai kai ischurai. The sense is, that his letters were energetic and powerful. They abounded with strong argument, manly appeals, and impressive reproof. This even his enemies were compelled to admit, and this no one can deny who ever read them. Paul's letters comprise a considerable portion of the New Testament; and some of the most important doctrines of the New Testament are those which are advocated and enforced by him; and his letters have done more to give shape to the theological doctrines of the Christian world than any other cause whatever. He wrote 14 epistles to churches and individuals on various occasions and on a great variety of topics; and his letters soon rose into very high repute among even the inspired ministers of the New Testament (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16</a>), and were regarded as inculcating the most important doctrines of religion. The general characteristics of Paul's letters are:<p>(1) They are strongly argumentative. See especially the Epistles to the Romans and the Hebrews.<p>(2) they are distinguished for boldness and vigor of style.<p>(3) they are written under great energy of feeling and of thought - a rapid and impetuous torrent that bears him forcibly along.<p>(4) they abound more than most other writings in parentheses, and the sentences are often involved and obscure.<p>(5) they often evince rapid transitions and departures from the regular current of thought. A thought strikes him suddenly, and he pauses to illustrate it, and dwells upon it long, before he returns to the main subject. The consequence is, that it is often difficult to follow him.<p>(6) they are powerful in reproof - abounding with strokes of great boldness of denunciation, and also with specimens of most withering sarcasm and most delicate irony.<p>(7) they abound in expressions of great tenderness and pathos. Nowhere can be found expressions of a heart more tender and affectionate than in the writings of Paul.<p>(8) they dwell much on great and profound doctrines, and on the application of the principles of Christianity to the various duties of life.<p>(9) they abound with references to the Saviour. He illustrates everything by his life, his example, his death, his resurrection. It is not wonderful that letters composed on such subjects and in such a manner by an inspired man produced a deep impression on the Christian world; nor that they should be regarded now as among the most important and valuable portions of the Bible. Take away Paul's letters, and what a chasm would be made in the New Testament! What a chasm in the religious opinions and in the consolations of the Christian world!<p>But his bodily presence - His personal appearance.<p>Is weak - Imbecile, feeble (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2;  asthene&#772;s) - a word often used to denote infirmity of body, sickness, disease; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-39.htm">Matthew 25:39</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-43.htm">Matthew 25:43-44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-9.htm">Luke 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-9.htm">Acts 4:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/5-15.htm">Acts 5:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>. Here it is to be observed that this is a mere charge which was brought against him, and it is not of necessity to be supposed that it was true, though the presumption is, that there was some foundation for it. It is supposed to refer to some bodily imperfections, and possibly to his diminutive stature. Chrysostom says that his stature was low, his body crooked, and his head bald. Lucian, in his Philopatris, says of him, "Corpore erat parvo, contracto, incurvo, tricubitali" - probably an exaggerated description, perhaps a caricature - to denote one very diminutive and having no advantages of personal appearance. According to Nicephorus, Paul "was a little man, crooked, and almost bent like a bow; with a pale countenance, long and wrinkled; a bald head; his eyes full of fire and benevolence; his beard long, thick, and interspersed with gray hairs, as was his head," etc. But there is no certain evidence of the truth of these representations. Nothing in the Bible would lead us to suppose that Paul was remarkably diminutive or deformed; and though there may be some foundation for the charge here alleged that his bodily presence was weak, yet we are to remember that this was the accusation of his enemies, and that it was doubtless greatly exaggerated. Nicephorus was a writer of the sixteenth century, and his statements are worthy of no regard. That Paul was eminently an eloquent man may be inferred from a great many considerations; some of which are:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. letters&#8212;implying that there had been already more letters of Paul received by the Corinthians than the one we have, namely, First Corinthians; and that they contained strong reproofs.<p>say they&#8212;Greek, "says one," "such a one" (2Co 10:11) seems to point to some definite individual.

It is as though he felt that his appearance was against him.... His language leaves on us the impression of one who was acutely sensitive, and whose sensitiveness of temperament has been aggravated by a meanness of presence which is indeed forgotten by the friends who know him, but which raises in strangers a prejudice not always overcome" (Farrar).<p>Bodily presence<p>All the traditions as to Paul's personal appearance are late. A bronze medal discovered in the cemetery of St. Domitilla at Rome, and ascribed to the first or second century, represents the apostle with a bald, round, well-developed head; rather long, curling beard; high forehead; prominent nose; and open, staring eye. The intellectual character of the face is emphasized by the contrast with the portrait of Peter, which faces Paul's. Peter's forehead is flat, the head not so finely developed, the face commonplace, the cheek bones high, the eye small, and the hair and beard short, thick, and curling. An ivory diptych of the fourth century, reproduced in Mr. Lewin's "Life of Paul," contains two portraits. In the one he is sitting in an official chair, with uplifted hand and two fingers raised, apparently in the act of ordination. The face is oval, the beard long and pointed, the moustache full, the forehead high, the head bald, and the eyes small and weak. The other portrait represents him in the act of throwing off the viper. A forgery of the fourth century, under the name of Lucian, alludes to him as "the bald-headed, hooknosed Galilean." In the "Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles" mention is made of one Dioscorus, the bald shipmaster, who followed Paul to Rome, and was mistaken for him and beheaded in his stead. In the "Acts of Paul and Thekla," a third-century romance, he is described as "short, bald, bowlegged, with meeting eyebrows, hook-nosed, full of grace." John of Antioch, in the sixth century, says that he was round-shouldered, with aquiline nose, greyish eyes, meeting eyebrows, and ample beard.<p>Contemptible (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., made nothing of.
