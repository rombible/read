The abruptness of the sentence requires us to trace between the lines the under-currents of unexpressed thoughts. The extreme, almost jealous, sensitiveness of the Apostle’s nature leads him to imagine the cynical sneer with which these assertions of disinterested work would be received. “Be it so,” he hears them saying; “we admit that he, in his own person, when he was with us, made no demands on our purses; but what are we to think of this ‘collection for the saints’? How do we know into whose pockets that money will go? We know him to be <span class= "ital">subtle</span> enough” (the adjective is that from which we get the “subtlety” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2Corinthians 11:3</a>) “to take us in somehow: what if the collection be a trap?” There is a specially taunting force in the Greek for “<span class= "ital">being</span> crafty,” as taking the fact for granted, and assuming that it would inevitably lead on to some new development of that character in act.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/12-16.htm" title="But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile....">2 Corinthians 12:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Be it so, </span>&c. — But some may object; though <span class="ital">I did not burden you </span>— Though I did not take any thing of you myself; yet <span class="ital">being crafty, I caught you with guile </span>— I did secretly by my messengers what I would not do openly or in person.

Here is an account of the apostle's behaviour and kind intentions; in which see the character of a faithful minister of the gospel. This was his great aim and design, to do good. Here are noticed several sins commonly found among professors of religion. Falls and misdeeds are humbling to a minister; and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be tempted to be lifted up. These vast verses show to what excesses the false teachers had drawn aside their deluded followers. How grievous it is that such evils should be found among professors of the gospel! Yet thus it is, and has been too often, and it was so even in the days of the apostles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But be it so - This is evidently a charge of his enemies; or at least a charge which it might be supposed they would make. Whether they ever in fact made it, or whether the apostle merely anticipates an objection, it is impossible to determine. It is clearly to be regarded as the language of objectors; for:<p>(1) It can never be supposed that Paul would state as a serious matter that he had caught them with deceit or fraud.<p>(2) he answers it as an objection in the following verse. The meaning is, "We admit that you did not burden us. You did not exact a support from us. But all this was mere trick. You accomplished the same thing in another way. You professed when with us not to seek our property but our souls. But in various ways you contrived to get our money, and to secure your object. You made others the agents for doing this, and sent them among us under various pretexts to gain money from us." It will be remembered that Paul had sent; Titus among them to take up the collection for the poor saints in Judea <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>, and it is not at all improbable that some there had charged Paul with making use of this pretence only to obtain money for his own private use. To guard against this charge. was one of the reasons why Paul was so anxious to have some persons appointed by the church to take charge of the contribution; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3</a>; compare the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-19.htm">2 Corinthians 8:19-21</a>.<p>Being crafty - Being cunning That is, by sending persons to obtain money on different pretences.<p>I caught you with guile - I took you by deceit or fraud. That is, making use of fraud in pretending that the money was for poor and afflicted saints, when in reality it was for my own use. It is impossible that Paul should have ever admitted this of himself; and they greatly pervert the passage who suppose that it applies to him, and then plead that it is right to make use of guile in accomplishing their purposes. Paul never carried his measures by dishonesty, nor did he ever justify fraud; compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. I did not burden you&#8212;The "I" in the Greek is emphatic. A possible insinuation of the Corinthians is hereby anticipated and refuted: "But, you may say, granted that I did not burden you myself; nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you (in my net) with guile"; namely, made a gain of you by means of others (1Th 2:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I hear what some say: It is true, that when I was myself with you, I laid no burden upon you, did not put upon you any collection for me; but, like a crafty man, I set others to take money of you for my use; so as, what I did not by myself, I did by those whom I employed.
