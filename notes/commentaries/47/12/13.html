If they complained of this, they should, at least, remember that this was the only point of inferiority. They had experienced fully all the advantages that flowed from his special power as an Apostle. For that wrong, so far as it was a wrong, he asks their forgiveness.<p><span class= "bld">That I myself was not burdensome.</span>—He uses here, and in the next verse, the same characteristic word for “sponging” on them, which has been commented on in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>. He obviously dwells on it with a touch of irony, as a word that had been used of him by some of his rivals.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:11-21 We owe it to good men, to stand up in the defence of their reputation; and we are under special obligations to those from whom we have received benefit, especially spiritual benefit, to own them as instruments in God's hand of good to us. Here is an account of the apostle's behaviour and kind intentions; in which see the character of a faithful minister of the gospel. This was his great aim and design, to do good. Here are noticed several sins commonly found among professors of religion. Falls and misdeeds are humbling to a minister; and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be tempted to be lifted up. These vast verses show to what excesses the false teachers had drawn aside their deluded followers. How grievous it is that such evils should be found among professors of the gospel! Yet thus it is, and has been too often, and it was so even in the days of the apostles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For what is it ... - This verse contains a striking mixture of sarcasm and irony, not exceeded, says Bloomfield, by any example in Demosthenes. the sense is," I have given among you the most ample proof of my apostolic commission. I have conferred on you the highest favors of the apostolic office. In these respects you are superior to all other churches. In one respect only are you inferior - it is in this, that you have not been burdened with the privilege of supporting me. If you had had this, you would have been inferior to no others. But this was owing to me; and I pray that you will forgive me this I might have urged it; I might have claimed it; I might have given you the privilege of becoming equal to the most favored in all respects. But I have not pressed it, and you have not done it, and I ask your pardon." There is a delicate insinuation that they had not contributed to his needs (see the note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-8.htm">2 Corinthians 11:8</a>); an intimation that it was a privilege to contribute to the support of the gospel, and that Paul might have been "burdensome to them" (see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-12</a>); and an admission that he was in part to blame for this, and had not in this respect given them an opportunity to equal other churches in all respects.<p>Was not burdensome to you - see this explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>.<p>Forgive me this wrong - "If it be a fault, pardon it. Forgive me that I did not give you this opportunity to be equal to other churches. It is a privilege to contribute to the support of the gospel, and they who are permitted to do it should esteem themselves highly favored. I pray you to pardon me for depriving you of any of your Christian privileges." What the feelings of the Corinthians were about forgiving Paul for this we know not; but most churches would be as ready to forgive a minister for this as for any other offence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. wherein you were inferior&#8212;that is, were treated with less consideration by me than were other churches.<p>I myself&#8212;I made a gain of you neither myself, nor by those others whom I sent, Titus and others (2Co 12:17, 18).<p>wrong&#8212;His declining support from the Corinthians might be regarded as the denial to them of a privilege, and a mark of their spiritual inferiority, and of his looking on them with less confidence and love (compare 2Co 11:9, 11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Wherein have not you been used as any other gospel churches were, where Peter, or James, or any other of the apostles have laboured?

I know of nothing in which it hath not fared with you as with other churches, except in this; that whereas in other churches the apostles, or their pastors, have been burdensome to them, taking stipends and salaries for their pains, I have forborne it, and have not at all charged you. If this be a <span class="bld">wrong</span> to you, I hope it is not of that nature, but I may obtain a pardon for it. The reasons of the apostle’s thus sparing the church of Corinth more than some other churches, we have before guessed at. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,.... The apostle here suggests, and appeals to themselves for the truth of it, that in nothing they came short of other churches; that as he was not behind the very chiefest of the apostles, and so they had no reason to be ashamed of him and despise him; neither were they inferior in gifts, grace, and knowledge, to other churches, all which were through his ministry; wherefore they ought to have spoken well of him, and not to have taken the part of the false apostles against him; since all the honour and credit they were in as a church were owing to him as an instrument. The Gospel was first preached to them by an apostle; they were converted under the ministry of an apostle; they were planted and settled as a church by the means of an apostle; and in which respects no church could go beyond them, or boast of more; they had the same Gospel preached to them, and with as much power and purity as other churches; they had received the same Spirit, the same graces, and the same gifts of the Spirit, both ordinary and extraordinary; so that they came behind others in no gift whatever; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>, and had the same miraculous works done among them, as were in other places, for the confirmation of the Gospel. There was not one thing the apostle could think of, in which they differed from others, and which he mentions; <p>except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? because he freely preached the Gospel to them, took no wages of them, but chose rather to work with his own hands, and supply his necessities, than to be troublesome to them; in this, indeed, they differed from other churches, who liberally contributed to their ministers, and honourably maintained them: <p>forgive me this wrong; not that the apostle seriously desired this, or thought that he had done them any real injury, and so acknowledges it; for if any wrong was done hereby, it was to himself, and not them; but it is an ironical way of speaking, and was a sharp rebuke to them, for their ignorance, ingratitude, and negligence. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except <i>it be</i> that I myself was not <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</span><p>(m) I was not slothful with my own hands, so that I might not be burdensome to you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τί γάρ ἐστιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>] Bitterly ironical justification of what was said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>. <span class="ital">For what is there, in which you were placed at a disadvantage towards the other churches</span> (in which I wrought), <span class="ital">except</span>, etc.? that is to say: for in nothing have you come behind, as compared with the other churches, except, etc. Quite arbitrarily Grotius limits this question, which embraces the <span class="ital">whole</span> blissful apostolic working, to the <span class="ital">communication of gifts by the laying on of hands</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>] means nothing else than <span class="ital">beyond</span>, but in the direction downward (reference to the <span class="ital">minus</span>) which <span class="greekheb">ἡττήθητε</span> specifies.

Rückert, overlooking the <span class="ital">comparative sense</span> of <span class="greekheb">ἡττήθητε</span>, says: there is here an ironical confession that all churches had disadvantage from Paul, and it is only denied that the disadvantage of the Corinthian was greater than that of the other churches.
