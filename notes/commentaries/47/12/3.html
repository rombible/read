Whether heavenly things were brought down to him, while his body was in a trance, as in the case of ancient prophets; or whether his soul was dislodged from the body for a time, and taken up into heaven, or whether he was taken up, body and soul together, he knew not. We are not capable, nor is it fit we should yet know, the particulars of that glorious place and state. He did not attempt to publish to the world what he had heard there, but he set forth the doctrine of Christ. On that foundation the church is built, and on that we must build our faith and hope. And while this teaches us to enlarge our expectations of the glory that shall be revealed, it should render us contented with the usual methods of learning the truth and will of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I knew such a man - It is not uncommon to repeat a solemn affirmation in order that it may be made more emphatic. This is done here. Paul repeats the idea, that he was intimately acquainted with such a man, and that he did not know whether he was in the body or out of the body.

If any inquireth, for what purpose God showed them to Paul, if he might not communicate them for the good of others? The answer is easy; that this vision might be for his own confirmation, as sent of God, and for his consolation under all those hazards and dangers which he was to undergo in the ministry of the gospel, to which God had called him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I knew such a man,....

Most expositors consider the <span class="ital">matter itself</span> as not different from what is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, so that <span class="greekheb">τρίτος οὐρανός</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁ παράδεισος</span> would be one and the same. But it is decisive against this view, that <span class="greekheb">ὁ τρίτος οὐρανός</span> cannot without arbitrariness be taken otherwise than of a region of heaven comparatively low (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>). Besides, the whole circumstantial repetition, only with a change in designating the place, would not be solemn language, but battology. This also in opposition to Hofmann, who imports the modification: “The one time emphasis is laid only on the <span class="ital">surroundings</span>, into which he found himself transported away from the <span class="ital">earth</span>; the other time on the contrast of the <span class="ital">fellowship of God</span>, into which he was transported away <span class="ital">from the church of God here below</span>.” Clemens Alexandrinus, Irenaeus, Origen, Athanasius, and several Fathers and schoolmen (see Estius and Bengel on the passage), also Erasmus[362] and Bengel,[363] have rightly <span class="ital">distinguished</span> paradise from the third heaven. Comp. also Hahn, <span class="ital">Theol. d. N. T.</span> I. p. 246; Osiander, Hilgenfeld, and others. Still we are not, with Bengel (comp. de Wette), to regard (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>) paradise as <span class="ital">interius quiddam in coelo tertio, quam ipsum coelum tertium</span> (comp. Cornelius a Lapide); but Paul relates first how he was caught up into the third heaven, and then adds, as a further point in the experience, that he was transported further, higher up into paradise, so that the <span class="greekheb">ἕως τρίτου οὐρανοῦ</span> was a break, as it were, a resting-point of the <span class="ital">raptus</span>. Thus, too, the repetition of the same words, as well as the repetition of the parenthesis, obtains its solemn character; for the incident is reported <span class="ital">step by step, i.e.</span> in two stages.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The paradise</span> is here not the <span class="ital">lower, i.e.</span> the place in <span class="ital">Sheol</span>, in which the spirits of the departed righteous are until the resurrection (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-23.htm" title="And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.">Luke 16:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.">Luke 23:43</a>), nor as Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> II. 1, p. 489, substitutes in place of this historical conception the abstraction: “the present communion of the blessed dead with God, as it is on this side of the end of things;” but the <span class="ital">upper</span>, the paradise of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.">Revelation 2:7</a>; Enoch 35:1) in heaven, where God’s dwelling is. This distinction is one given historically, and necessary for the understanding of the passage, and is rightly maintained also by Osiander, Hahn, and others. Comp. the Rabbinical passages in Eisenmenger, <span class="ital">entdeckt. Judenth.</span> I. 296 ff., and generally, Thilo, <span class="ital">ad Ev. Nic.</span> 25, p. 748 ff.; Gfrörer, <span class="ital">Jahrh. d. Heils</span>, II. p. 42 ff. The idea, however, that Christ has carried the believing souls out of Hades with Him to heaven (Delitzsch, <span class="ital">Psychol.</span> p. 414) goes beyond Scripture, and is not presupposed even in this passag.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄῤῥητα ῥήματα</span>] an oxymoron:[364] <span class="ital">dicta nefanda dictu, speakings, which may not be spoken</span> (Dem. 1369. 25, 1370. 14; Soph. <span class="ital">O. R.</span> 465; Eur. <span class="ital">Hel.</span> 1370; and Pflugk <span class="ital">in loc.</span>), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> which may not be made the subject of communication to others. The revelations which Paul received were so sublime and holy, that the further communication of them would have been at variance with their character; what was disclosed to him was to be for him alone, for his special enlightenment, strengthening, comforting, with a view to the fulfilment of his great task; to others it was to remain a mystery, in order to preclude fanatical or other misuse; comp. Calvin. That <span class="greekheb">ἄῤῥητα</span> here does not mean <span class="ital">quae dici negueunt</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Soph</span>. p. 238 C), as Beza, Estius, Calovius, Wolf, and many others, including Billroth and Olshausen, hold (Rückert is not decided), is shown by the solemn epexegetical <span class="greekheb">ἃ οὐκ ἐξὸν ἀνθρώπῳ λαλῆσαι</span>, in which <span class="greekheb">ἐξόν</span> means <span class="ital">licet, fas est</span>, and is not—as Luther and many older and later commentators, including Billroth and Olshausen, wish to take it, quite at variance with the signification of the word—equivalent to <span class="greekheb">δύνατον</span>. The Vulgate aptly renders: “et audivit <span class="ital">arcana</span> verba, quae non <span class="ital">licet</span> homini loqui,” <span class="ital">i.e. which a man may not utter aloud</span>.
