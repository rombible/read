The apostle, knowing that the sincere part of the church would be made sorry by his punishing their disobedient brethren, wished, if possible, to avoid doing it. And, added to this, the recovery of offenders would give him more sensible joy than any thing else; considerations which, taken together, abundantly justify the language he here uses. <span class="ital">And I wrote this same, </span><span class="greekheb">τουτο αυτο</span>, <span class="ital">this very thing, to you — </span>About reforming what is amiss, particularly to excommunicate the incestuous person, and to shun all contentions, sinful practices, and confusion in your meetings; <span class="ital">lest when I came </span>again to Corinth, as I proposed, <span class="ital">I should have sorrow from them </span>— Lest I should have occasion to censure and punish any, (to do which would be grievous to me,) of <span class="ital">whom </span>— In whose repentance; <span class="ital">I ought to rejoice, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all — </span>That in general you bear the same affection toward me, as I feel in my heart toward you, and are desirous of giving me cause of joy, rather than of sorrow.

"I would not come, if I could avoid it, in circumstances which must have grieved both me and you. I would not come while there existed among you such irregularities as must have pained my heart, and as must have compelled me to resort to such acts of discipline as would be painful to you. I resolved, therefore, to endeavor to remove these evils before I came, that when I did come, my visit might be mutually agreeable to us both. For that reason I changed my purpose about visiting you, when I heard of those disorders, and resolved to send an epistle. If that should be successful, then the way would be open for an agreeable visit to you." This verse, therefore, contains the statement of the principal reason why he had not come to them as he had at first proposed. It was really from no fickleness, but it was from love to them, and a desire that his visit should be mutually agreeable, compare the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>2Co 2:1-17.

The same antithesis between Paul and them appears in 2Co 2:2.<p>not come again &#8230; in heaviness&#8212;"sorrow"; implying that he had already paid them one visit in sorrow since his coming for the first time to Corinth. At that visit he had warned them "he would not spare if he should come again" (see on [2304]2Co 13:2; compare 2Co 12:14; 13:1). See [2305]Introduction to the first Epistle. The "in heaviness" implies mutual pain; they grieving him, and he them. Compare 2Co 2:2, "I make you sorry," and 2Co 2:5, "If any have caused grief (sorrow)."

The apostle having removed the charge of levity and inconstancy brought against him, goes on to excuse his delay in coming to them, and to soften the severity, which some thought too much, he had used in his former epistle: he determined with himself, he took up a resolution within his own breast some time ago, says he, <p>that I would not come again to you in heaviness; that he would not come with sorrow and heaviness, bewailing their sins not repented of, and by sharp reproofs and censures, which in such a case would be necessary, be the cause of grief and trouble to them; wherefore he determined to wait their repentance and amendment before he came again. The word "again", may be connected with the phrase "in heaviness"; and the sense be, that in his former epistle, which was a sort of coming to them, he made them heavy and sorry, by sharply rebuking them for some disorders that were among them; and since it has been a settled point with him, that he would not come in heaviness again: or with the word "come"; and then the meaning is, as his first coming among them was to the joy of their souls, so it was a determined case with him, that his second coming should not be with grief, either to them or himself, or both; and this is the true reason why he had deferred it so long. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> heaviness.</span><p>(a) Causing grief among you, which he would have done if he had come to them before they had repented.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔκρινα δὲ ἐμαυτῷ τοῦτο</span>] <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> is the usual <span class="greekheb">μεταβατικόν</span>, which leads on from the assurance given by Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>, to the thought that he <span class="ital">in his own interest</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐμαυτῷ</span>, dativus <span class="ital">commodi</span>; for see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?">2 Corinthians 2:2</a>) was not willing to come again to them <span class="greekheb">ἐν λύπῃ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The interpretation <span class="ital">apud me</span> (Vulgate, Luther, Beza, and many others) would require <span class="greekheb">παρʼ ἐμαυτῷ</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐμ</span>.

The connection with <span class="greekheb">ἐλθεῖν</span> merely (Pelagius, Primasius, Theodoret, and the most; also Flatt, Baur, Reiche), a consequence of the error that Paul before our Epistles had been only <span class="ital">once</span> in Corinth,[137] is improbable even with the <span class="ital">Recepta</span> (the more suitable order of the words would be: <span class="greekheb">τὸ μὴ ἐν λύπῃ πάλιν ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>), but is impossible both with our reading and with that of Tischendorf (see the critical remarks), unless we quite arbitrarily suppose, with Grotius (comp. also Reiche), a <span class="ital">trajectio</span>, or, with Baur, I. p. 342, an inaccuracy of epistolary styl.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν λύπῃ</span>] <span class="ital">provided with affliction</span> (Bernhardy, p. 109; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-29.htm" title="And I am sure that, when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:29</a>), <span class="ital">bringing affliction with me</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">afflicting you</span>. This explanation (Theodoret, Calvin, Grotius, and others, including Ewald) is, indeed, held by Hofmann to be impossible in itself, but is required by the following <span class="greekheb">εἰ γὰρ ἐγὼ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς</span>. Hence Billroth and Hofmann, following Chrysostom and many others, are wrong in thinking that <span class="ital">the apostle’s</span> own sadness is meant; and so also Bengel, Olshausen, Rückert, de Wette, Reiche, Neander, following Ambrosiaster, and others, who think that it is also included.

The apparent difficulty, that Paul in our first Epistle makes no mention whatever of the fact and manner of his former visit to Corinth when he caused affliction, is obviated by the consideration that only after our first Epistle was the change of plan used to the apostle’s disadvantage, and that only now was he thereby compelled to mention the earlier arrival which had been made <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΛΎΠῌ</span></span></span>. Hence this passage is not a proof for the assumption of a journey to Corinth <span class="ital">between</span> our two Epistles (see the Introd.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[137] This error has compelled many to get out of the difficulty by conceiving our first <span class="ital">Epistle</span> as the first coming <span class="greekheb">ἐν λύπῃ</span> So Chrysostom, Calvin, Beza, Bengel, and others. Lange, <span class="ital">Apostol. Zeitalt</span>. I. p. 204, believes that he has found another way: that Paul had the veryfirst time come to Corinth in affliction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.">1 Corinthians 2:1</a> ff.), which affliction <span class="ital">he had brought mill him from Athens</span>.

The juxtaposition of <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐν λύπῃ</span> (see crit. note) requires that interpretation. Hence the former visit in St. Paul’s mind could not have been his <span class="ital">first</span> visit to Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-1.htm" title="After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;">Acts 18:1</a> ff.), for that was not <span class="greekheb">ἐν λύπῃ</span>. And thus we are forced to conclude that another visit was paid from Ephesus, of which no details have been preserved (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). The conditions of the scanty evidence available seem best satisfied by supposing that St. Paul’s second visit to Corinth was paid from Ephesus during the period <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-10.htm" title="And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelled in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.">Acts 19:10</a>. Alarming news had probably reached him, and he determined to make enquiries for himself. On his return to Ephesus he wrote the letter (now lost) alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>, in which he charged the Corinthians “to keep no company with fornicators”.

St Paul’s only Object the Spiritual Advancement of his Converts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="ital">But I determined this with myself</span>] St Paul now further vindicates his consistency. Not only did he stay away from Corinth to spare the Corinthians the sharp rebukes which his immediate presence would have necessitated, but he hoped by means of the Epistle to work so salutary a reformation as to make his visit to Corinth a time of the deepest spiritual joy. The ‘but’ in the English version should be rendered <span class="ital">and</span>, thus carrying on the explanation from ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>. For ‘<span class="ital">with</span> myself recent commentators prefer the rendering <span class="ital">for</span> myself,’ i.e. for the better carrying on of the work St Paul had in hand, which however (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more....">1 Corinthians 9:19-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-33.htm" title="Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>) was not his own profit, but the good of his converts. We may thus paraphrase his words, <span class="ital">I decided that the best course for me to pursue was not to come again to you in heaviness</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that I would not come again to you in heaviness</span>] There seems no need to suppose, with some commentators, that ‘again’ belongs to ‘in heaviness,’ and to explain it of some unrecorded visit which the Apostle paid in trouble of mind. The very contrary seems to be implied. St Paul’s great anxiety was <span class="ital">not</span> to visit the Corinthian Church in such a frame of mind. It falls in best with the context to explain ‘I determined that my <span class="ital">second</span> visit should not be paid while under the influence of painful feelings.’ Olshausen remarks that the ‘heaviness’ here spoken of belongs as much to the Corinthians as to the Apostle.

The division of chapters is here unfortunate, since this and the next three verses belong to the paragraph which began at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>.  The verb means, literally, "I judged," but is rightly rendered "determined," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-37.htm">1 Corinthians 7:37</a>. He is contrasting his <span class="accented">final decision</span> with his original <span class="accented">desire</span>, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-15.htm">2 Corinthians 1:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With myself;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for myself</span>; as the best course which I could take. <span class="cmt_word">That I would net come again to you in heaviness.</span> The "again" in the true reading is not placed immediately before the verb, but it seems (as Theodoret says) to belong to it, so that the meaning is <span class="accented">not</span> "that I would not pay you a <span class="accented">second</span> sad visit," but "that <span class="accented">my second visit to you</span> should not be a sad one." There have been interminable discussions, founded on this expression and on ch. 13:1, as to whether St. Paul had up to the time of writing this letter visited Corinth <span class="accented">twice</span> or only <span class="accented">once</span>. There is no question that only one visit is recorded in the Acts (Acts 18:1-18) previous to the one which he paid to this Church after this Epistle had been sent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2, 3</a>). If he paid them a second brief, sad, and unrecorded visit, it can only have been during his long stay in Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8, 10</a>). But the possibility of this does not seem to be recognized in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>, where he speaks of his work at Ephesus "night and day" during this period. The assumption of such a visit, as we shall see, is not necessitated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>, but in any case we know nothing whatever about the details of the visit, even if there was one, and the question, being supremely unimportant, is hardly worth the time which has been spent upon it. If he <span class="accented">had</span> paid such a visit, it would be almost unaccountable that there should be no reference to it in the First Epistle, and here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a> he refers only to one occasion on which he had preached Christ in Corinth. Each fresh review of the circumstances convinces me more strongly that the notion of <span class="accented">three</span> visits to Corinth, of which one is unrecorded, is a needless and mistaken inference, due to unimaginative literalism in interpreting one or two phrases, and encumbered with difficulties on every side. In <span class="accented">heaviness</span>. The expression applies as much to the Corinthians as to himself, he did not wish his second visit to Corinth to be a painful one. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>With myself (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;)<p>Rev., better, for myself. Paul, with affectionate tact, puts it as if he had taken this resolution for his own pleasure.<p>In heaviness (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Meaning, apparently, the apostle's own sorrowful state of mind.
