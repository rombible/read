He had wished to avoid a visit that would cause sorrow to himself and others, and events had shown that he was right. But it might be said, perhaps had been said, that he didn’t seem to care about giving pain when he wrote, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.">1Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1Corinthians 5:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-5.htm" title="I speak to your shame.

How little prepared would they be to make me happy, and to comfort me, amidst the deep sorrow which I should have caused by an act of severe discipline. After such an act - an act that would spread sorrow through the whole church, how could I expect that comfort which I should desire to find among you. The whole church would be affected with grief; and though I might be sustained by the sound part of the church, yet my visit would be attended with painful circumstances. I resolved, therefore, to remove all cause of difficulty, if possible, before I came, that my visit might be pleasant to us all." The idea is, that there was such a sympathy between him and them; that he was so attached to them, that he could not expect to be happy unless they were happy; that though he might be conscious he was only discharging a duty, and that God would sustain him in it, yet that it would mar the pleasure of his visit, and destroy all his anticipated happiness by the general grief. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. For&#8212;proof that he shrinks from causing them sorrow ("heaviness").<p>if I&#8212;The "I" is emphatic. Some detractor may say that this (2Co 2:1) is not my reason for not coming as I proposed; since I showed no scruple in causing "heaviness," or sorrow, in my Epistle (the first Epistle to the Corinthians). But I answer, If I be the one to cause you sorrow, it is not that I have any pleasure in doing so. Nay, my object was that he "who was made sorry by me" (namely, the Corinthians in general, 2Co 2:3; but with tacit reference to the incestuous person in particular) should repent, and so "make me glad," as has actually taken place; "for &#8230; who is he then that?" &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> When I am there, I have no refreshment or joy in that part of the citizens who are pagans, all my joy is in that part which are Christians, and constitute the church of God in that city: so as I could have had no pleasure or joy in my being there, if I had had nothing but occasion of sadness and heaviness from you, in whom was all my expectation of any joy or refreshing. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For if I make you sorry,.... That is, should he come among them, and be the means of fresh grief and sorrow: <p>who is he then that maketh me glad? such was his love and affection for them, and sympathy with them, that should they be grieved, he should grieve also; they were the only persons he could take any delight in at Corinth; wherefore should they be in heaviness, he would be so too, and then what pleasure would he have in being among them? since not a man of them would be in a condition and capacity to make him cheerful: <p>but the same which is made sorry by me. The Ethiopic version without any authority reads this clause, "except he whom I have made glad"; but the apostle is to be understood either of some particular man, the incestuous person, who had been made sorry, by that awful punishment of being delivered up to Satan, inflicted on him; or else the singular number being put for the plural collectively, is to be understood of all the members of the church at Corinth, who had been greatly grieved by the sharp reproofs he had given them; and therefore unless this trouble was removed, he could not expect to have much comfort and pleasure with them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?">2 Corinthians 2:2</a>. As <span class="ital">reason</span> for his undertaking not to come to his readers again <span class="greekheb">ἐν λύπῃ</span>, Paul states that he on his own part could not in this case hope to find any joy among them. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I wrote this same to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.">2 Corinthians 2:3</a>. <span class="ital">For if I afflict you, who is there also to give me joy, except him who is afflicted by me?</span>—<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, if I on my part (<span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span> is emphatic[138]) make you afflicted, then results the contradiction that the very one who is afflicted by me is the one who should give me joy. Against this view Billroth and Rückert object that <span class="greekheb">εἰ μὴ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐμοῦ</span> is superfluous, and even in the way. No; it discloses the absurdity of the case conditioned by <span class="greekheb">εἰ ἐγὼ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς</span>. Pelagius, Bengel, and others, including Billroth, render: <span class="ital">who yet so much gladdens me as he who lets himself be afflicted by me</span> (which is a sign of amendment)? Comp. Chrysostom, and Theodoret, Erasmus, and others. So also Olshausen, who sees here an indirect warning to take the former censure more to heart. But against this perversion of <span class="greekheb">ὁ λυπούμενος</span> in a middle sense, we may decisively urge:—(1) that the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?">2 Corinthians 2:2</a> would not stand in any relation to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.">2 Corinthians 2:1</a> as furnishing a reason for it; and (2) the <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἵνα λυπηθῆτε</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>. Rückert sees in <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> an aposiopesis; then begins a new question, which contains the reason why he may not afflict them, because it would be unloving, nay, ungrateful, to afflict those who cause him so much joy. Hence the meaning, touchingly expressed, is: “I might not come to you afflicting you; for if I had done so, I should have afflicted those very ones who give me joy: this would have been unloving on my part.” This is all the more arbitrary, since, logically at least, it must have stood in the converse order: <span class="greekheb">καὶ τίς ἐστιν ὁ λυπούμενος ἐξ ἐμοῦ εἰ μὴ ὁ εὐφραίνων με</span>. Hofmann holds still more arbitrarily and oddly that <span class="greekheb">εἰ γάρ</span> is elliptical protasis, and <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς</span> apodosis: <span class="ital">if I come to you again in affliction, I make you afflicted, and who is there then who gladdens me, except him whom affliction coming from me befalls?</span> The well-known omission of the verb in the protasis after <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> is, in fact, a usage of quite another nature (see Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell.</span> II. p. 213; Stallbaum, <span class="ital">ad Plat. Rep.</span> p. 497; Krüger, § lxv. 5. 11). Besides, this subtlety falls with Hofmann’s view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καί</span>] <span class="ital">also</span>, expresses after the conditional clause the <span class="ital">simultaneousness</span> of what is contained in the apodosis, consequently without the interrogative form: there is <span class="ital">also no one</span>, etc. See Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell.</span> I. p. 130 f.; Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut.

But the rendering gives a false impression to a modern ear. The best equivalent in modern English is ‘if I <span class="ital">pain</span> you.’ The idea of sorrow for the sin does not appear to have been introduced as yet. The ‘<span class="ital">I</span>’ in this passage is emphatic; ‘if I, whose sole delight is to see you happy, inflict pain, it is with the object of bringing about happiness in the end.’ The connection of this verse with the preceding implied in the word ‘for’ seems to be as follows: “I <span class="ital">wrote</span> to cause pain, it is true, but it was in order that such pain should be removed before I came.” Cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</span>] The apparent selfishness of this passage, in which St Paul appears to think that the grief he has caused is amply compensated for by the pleasure he receives from that grief, is explained by the words in the next verse, ‘having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.’ See note there. The meaning would seem to be that St Paul wished not to come to Corinth in sorrow, but in joy, and that this end was attained by the result of the rebukes of his Epistle, which produced pain, and pain reformation, and reformation a pure and heavenly joy on the part of all, of St Paul, of the Corinthian community, and of the offender himself, conditions obviously the most favourable to an Apostolic visit. Cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge!
