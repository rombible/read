For in his former letter, which was written in the end of the preceding year, he had exhorted them to make the collection, and had given it in charge to Titus, who carried that letter, to encourage them in the work. Besides, the Corinthians having expressed the greatest respect for the apostle in the letter which they sent to him, and the messengers, who brought him that letter, having assured him of their disposition to obey him in every thing, he did not doubt of their having complied with his request. And therefore, when he went into Macedonia the following spring, after pentecost, he told the Macedonian churches that Achaia was prepared since the end of the last year, firmly believing that it was so.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 When we would have others do good, we must act toward them prudently and tenderly, and give them time. Christians should consider what is for the credit of their profession, and endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. The duty of ministering to the saints is so plain, that there would seem no need to exhort Christians to it; yet self-love contends so powerfully against the love of Christ, that it is often necessary to stir up their minds by way of remembrance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For as touching the ministering to the saints - In regard to the collection that was to be taken up for the aid of the poor Christians in Judea; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8</a>.<p>It is superfluous ... - It is needless to urge that matter on you, because I know that you acknowledge the obligation to do it, and have already purposed it.<p>For me to write to you - That is, to write more, or to write largely on the subject.

As to you, <span class="bld">it is superfluous.</span> By this art letting them know, that he had no doubt, but a confident expectation, concerning them; the suggesting of which hath also the force of another argument, that they might not deceive the apostle’s good opinion and confidence of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For as touching the ministering to the saints,.... It looks at first sight as if the apostle was entering upon a new subject, though by what follows it appears to be the same; for by "ministering to the saints", he does not mean the ministry of the Gospel to them; nor that mutual assistance members of churches are to give each other; but either the fellowship of ministering to the saints, which the churches had entreated him, and his fellow ministers, to take upon them, namely, to take the charge of their collections, and distribute them to the poor saints at Jerusalem; or rather these collections themselves, and their liberality in them: with respect to which he says, <p>it is superfluous for me to write to you; that is, he thought it unnecessary to say any more upon that head, because he had used so many arguments already to engage them in it, in the foregoing chapter; and because he had sent three brethren to them, who well understood the nature of this service, and were very capable of speaking to it, and of enforcing the reasonings already used; and more especially he judged it needless to dwell on this subject, for the reasons following. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</span><p>(1) He wisely answers the suspicion which the Corinthians might conceive, as though the apostle in urging them so carefully was doubting of their good will. Therefore he witnesses that he does it not to teach them that they ought to help the saints, seeing that he had become surety for them to the Macedonians. But only to stir those up who were labouring by themselves, to the end that all things might both be in a better readiness, and also be more plentiful.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:">2 Corinthians 9:1</a>. Since the <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> connects the verse with what precedes, not only does the opinion of Semler, that chap. 9 contains a separate Epistle, fall to the ground, but also the hypothesis, that Paul writes <span class="ital">as if</span> he were beginning a new topic,—on the basis of which, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Emmerling (comp. Neander) thinks that between the composition of chap. 8 and that of chap. 9 a considerable time had elapsed. Against this may be urged also the fact that in new sections he does not begin with <span class="greekheb">περὶ μέν</span>, but with <span class="greekheb">περὶ δέ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.

Estius is right in saying that the apostle specifies with <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> the reason why he, in what goes before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-24.htm" title="Why show you to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.">2 Corinthians 8:24</a>), had exhorted them not to collecting, but to affectionate receiving of the brethren.

Even in classic writers (often in Thucyd.) the clauses corresponding to each other with <span class="greekheb">μέν</span> and <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> are found separated by intervening clauses.
