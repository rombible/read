Titus, and the other two mentioned in the foregoing chapter: one manuscript reads, "we have sent"; and the Ethiopic version, "they have sent", that is, the Macedonians; but the common reading is best. It might be objected, that since the apostle knew the forwardness of their minds, how ready they were a year ago, and had boasted so much of their liberality, that it must be unnecessary to send the brethren to them, to stir them up to this work; which objection is prevented by observing the reason of his sending them: <p>lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf: or, "in this part", in this particular thing,  , "concerning this business", or affair of beneficence to the poor, as the Syriac version renders it. He had boasted of them with respect to other things besides this; but he was chiefly concerned, knowing the frailty and changeableness of human nature, and how possible it was that their forwardness might abate, and they grow cold and indifferent to such service, lest his glorying of them should be in vain in this particular instance; wherefore he sent the brethren to put them on, that as they had begun they would finish: <p>that as I said ye may be ready, That as he had said to the Macedonians, that they were ready in mind, it might appear to be so; or as he had ordered them in his former epistle, they might be actually ready; have their collection ready made, so that there might be no gathering when he came. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-3.htm" title="Yet have I sent the brothers, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you may be ready:">2 Corinthians 9:3</a>. <span class="ital">Connection:</span> Although in regard to the <span class="ital">collection</span> I do not need to <span class="ital">write</span> to you, and that for the reason stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>, I have yet not been able to omit the <span class="ital">sending of the brethren</span> for this purpose, in order that, etc. Paul by this would direct attention not to the <span class="ital">general</span> object of this mission, but to the <span class="ital">special</span> one of having all things ready <span class="ital">before his arrival</span>.
