It should be given carefully. Works of charity, like other good works, should be done with thought and design. Due thought, as to our circumstances, and those we are about to relieve, will direct our gifts for charitable uses. Help should be given freely, be it more or less; not grudgingly, but cheerfully. While some scatter, and yet increase; others withhold more than is meet, and it tends to poverty. If we had more faith and love, we should waste less on ourselves, and sow more in hope of a plentiful increase. Can a man lose by doing that with which God is pleased? He is able to make all grace abound towards us, and to abound in us; to give a large increase of spiritual and of temporal good things. He can make us to have enough in all things; and to be content with what we have. God gives not only enough for ourselves, but that also wherewith we may supply the wants of others, and this should be as seed to be sown. We must show the reality of our subjection to the gospel, by works of charity. This will be for the credit of our profession, and to the praise and glory of God. Let us endeavour to copy the example of Christ, being unwearied in doing good, and deeming it more blessed to give than to receive. Blessed be God for the unspeakable gift of his grace, whereby he enables and inclines some of his people to bestow upon others, and others to be grateful for it; and blessed be his glorious name to all eternity, for Jesus Christ, that inestimable gift of his love, through whom this and every other good thing, pertaining to life and godliness, are freely given unto us, beyond all expression, measure, or bounds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whiles by the experiment ... - Or rather, by the experience of this ministration; the proof (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  dokime&#772;s), the evidence here furnished of your liberality.

It does not imply merely that there was a profession of religion, but that there was a real subjection to the gospel which they professed. This is not clearly expressed in our translation. Tyndale has expressed it better, "Which praise God for your obedience in acknowledging the gospel of Christ." There was a real and sincere submission to the gospel of Christ, and that was manifested by their giving liberally to supply the needs of others. The doctrine is, that one evidence of true subjection to the gospel; one proof that our profession is sincere and genuine, is a willingness to contribute to relieve the needs of the poor and afflicted friends of the Redeemer. And unto all people. That is, all others whom you may have the opportunity of relieving. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. by&#8212;through occasion of.<p>experiment&#8212;Translate, "the experience" [Ellicott and others].

That is, the poor saints at Jerusalem having a specimen, a proof, an experience of the liberality of the Gentile churches ministered to them by the apostles, first, <p>they glorify God; by giving thanks unto him, acknowledging him to be the author of all the grace and goodness which they, and others, were partakers of; particularly <p>for your professed subjection to the Gospel of Christ. The Gospel of Christ is the doctrine of grace, life, and salvation by Christ, of which he is the author, as God, the subject matter, as Mediator, and the preacher, as man: subjection to it lies in a hearty receiving of the doctrines of it, and a cheerful submission to his ordinances; and this subjection was professed, declared, and made known to the churches in Judea, by their sending so largely to their relief, which they would never have done, if they had not cordially embraced the Gospel of Christ; for true faith in the doctrine of grace, and a sincere obedience to it, are best declared and known by love to the saints; for faith works by love, both to Christ, and to his people: next they glorified God by giving thanks to him, <p>for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; which shows, that though they were truly grateful, and heartily thankful for the favours they themselves received, yet not for these only, but for what other poor saints, in other places, were also partakers of; yea, that in the first place they were more sensibly affected with, and more especially thankful for the grace of God bestowed on the Gentiles, in sending the Gospel among them, and bringing them to a subjection to it, than for the temporal good they received from them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whiles by the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for <i>your</i> liberal distribution unto them, and unto all <i>men</i>;</span><p>(k) By this proof of your liberality in this helping of them.<p>(l) In showing with one consent that you acknowledge that Gospel alone which you have willingly submitted yourselves to, declaring by this that you agree with the church of Jerusalem.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-13.htm" title="Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;">2 Corinthians 9:13</a> is not to be placed in a parenthesis; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-14.htm" title="And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.">2 Corinthians 9:14</a>.

So Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς δοκίμου ταύτης καὶ μεμαρτυρημένης ἐπὶ φιλανθρωπίᾳ διακονίας</span>.

So Calvin (“erat enim specimen idoneum probandae Corinthiorum caritatis, quod erga fratres procul remotos tam liberales erant”), Estius, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Rückert, Olshausen, de Wette, Ewald, Osiander; comp. also Hofman, who takes <span class="greekheb">τῆς διακονίας</span> as <span class="ital">epexegetical</span> genitive. But it is only in what follows that the ground of the praise is introduced as subsisting <span class="ital">in the Corinthians</span>, and that by a different preposition (<span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>), and, besides, it is most natural to understand <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΔΙΑΚΟΝΊΑς Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> <span class="ital">of that which is attested</span>, so that the attested character of the collecting work appears as the occasion (<span class="greekheb">διά</span>, see Winer, p. 357 [E.

We may add that Rückert arbitrarily finds here an evidence that Paul in the collection had it as his aim to break down the repugnance of the Jewish-Christians towards the Gentile-Christians by this proof of the latter’s love. Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>.

The <span class="ital">first</span> refers to the gospel of Christ (concerning Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>): <span class="ital">on account of the compliance with your confession</span> (because you are so obedient in fact to your Christian confession of faith), they praise God <span class="ital">in reference to the gospel of Christ</span>, which, in fact, produces such compliance of its confessors. The <span class="ital">second</span> reason refers to the persons, namely, to them, the receivers themselves, and all Christians in general: <span class="ital">and on account of the simplicity of the fellowship</span> (because you held the Christian fellowship in such a sincere and pure manner) they praise God <span class="ital">in reference to themselves and to all</span>, as those whom this <span class="greekheb">ἁπλότης τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κοινωνίας</span> goes to benefit. Paul rightly adds <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΕἸς ΠΆΝΤΑς</span></span></span>; for by the beneficence towards the Jews the Corinthians showed, in point of fact, that they excluded <span class="ital">no</span> Christians from the sincere fellowship of love. The expositors connect <span class="greekheb">εἰς το εὐαγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. either with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ὉΜΟΛΟΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>, so that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὉΜΟΛΟΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΕἸς</span></span></span> is said, like <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΊΣΤΙς ΕἸς</span></span></span> (Erasmus Schmid, Wolf, Flatt, Rückert, Ewald, Osiander, and others, including Billroth), or with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῇ ὙΠΟΤΑΓῇ</span></span></span> (Chrysostom, Erasmus, Calvin, Beza, Grotius, and many others), and then <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΑὐΤΟῪς Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΕἸς ΠΆΝΤΑς</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΚΟΙΝΩΝΊΑς</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>[293] But this view would require the connecting link of the article both before <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εὐαγγ</span>. and also before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΑὐΤΟΎς</span></span></span>, since neither <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΟΤΆΣΣΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> nor <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὉΜΟΛΟΓΕῖΝ</span></span></span> nor <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΙΝΩΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span> is construed with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span>, the last not even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-5.htm" title="For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;">Php 1:5</a> (in opposition to de Wette). The suggestion to which Hofmann has recourse, that the twice used <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span> expresses the <span class="ital">direction</span> in which both—the <span class="greekheb">ὑποταγὴ τῆς ὁμολογίας</span> and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΠΛΌΤΗς Τῆς ΚΟΙΝΩΝΊΑς</span></span></span>—take place, has against it the non-insertion of the connecting article, which only may be rightly omitted when <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span> in both cases belongs to the verb (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΟΞΆΖΟΝΤΕς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>).[294] Rückert’s appeal to the inexactness of the language in this chapter is unfounded and the more to be rejected, that no fault can be found with the meaning—by no means tame (Osiander), but rich in significant reference—which arises from the strictly grammatical construction. Observe especially the quite Pauline way of exhausting, by different prepositions, the different characteristic aspects of the subject-matter (here the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΟΞΆΖΕΙΝ ΤῸΝ ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span>), which he does according to the categories of the occasion (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΆ</span></span></span>), the ground (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΊ</span></span></span>), and the point of reference (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span>: with a view to).

Of the A.V. “by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the Gospel of Christ” Lightfoot truly remarks that “a concurrence of Latinisms obscures the sense and mars the English”. The contribution of money for the relief of the Christian poor is a <span class="greekheb">ὁμολογία</span>, inasmuch as it is the manifestation to the world of belief in Christ’s Gospel; <span class="greekheb">ὁμολοία</span> is a “confession” or “vow,” and so (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-17.htm" title="You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of your hand:">Deuteronomy 12:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-5.htm" title="And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this likes you, O you children of Israel, said the Lord GOD.">Amos 4:5</a>) = “a free will offering”.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἁπλότητι τῆς κοινωνίας κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">and for the liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all</span>.

Literally, it is <span class="bld">the subjection of your confession</span>, or <span class="bld">profession</span>, i.e. of Christianity. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses....">1 Timothy 6:12-13</a> (margin); <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm" title="Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)">Hebrews 10:23</a>. The brethren at Jerusalem glorified God for the fact that the profession of Christianity made by the Corinthians was in strict accordance with the precepts of the Gospel. It is obvious that this cannot be predicated of every individual, or even of every Church, and cannot therefore be assumed as a matter of course. It is, however, to be observed (see Meyer’s note) that ‘to the Gospel’ should perhaps be translated ‘towards the Gospel,’ i.e. towards the work of furthering it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and for your liberal distribution</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">and for the liberality of your contribution</span>.

Lit., as Rev., the obedience of your confession; that is, the obedience which results from your christian confession. &#x39f;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is once rendered in A.V. confession, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>; and elsewhere profession. Both renderings occur in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>. Rev., in every case, confession. A similar variation occurs in the rendering of &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, though in all but five of the twenty-three instances confess is used. Rev. retains profess in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>, and changes to confess in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-7.htm">Matthew 14:7</a>, promised (A.V. and Rev., see note), and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>, giving thanks; Rev., which make confession. Etymologically, confession is the literal rendering of &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, which is from &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; together, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9; to say; con together, fateor to say. The fundamental idea is that of saying the same thing as another; while profess (pro forth, fateor to say) is to declare openly. Hence, to profess Christ is to declare Him publicly as our Lord: to confess Christ is to declare agreement with all that He says. When Christ confesses His followers before the world, He makes a declaration in agreement with what is in His heart concerning them. Similarly, when He declares to the wicked "I never knew you" ("then will I profess, &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;"), a similar agreement between His thought and His declaration is implied. The two ideas run into each other, and the Rev. is right in the few cases in which it retains profess, since confess would be ambiguous. See, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>.<p>Liberal distribution (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., correctly, liberality of your contribution. &#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; communion includes the idea of communication of material things, and hence sometimes means that which is communicated. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>; so <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>.
