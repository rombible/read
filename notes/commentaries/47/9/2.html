Christians should consider what is for the credit of their profession, and endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. The duty of ministering to the saints is so plain, that there would seem no need to exhort Christians to it; yet self-love contends so powerfully against the love of Christ, that it is often necessary to stir up their minds by way of remembrance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I know the forwardness of your mind - I know your promptitude, or your readiness to do it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10</a>. Probably Paul here means that he had had opportunity before of witnessing their readiness to do good, and that he had learned in particular of Titus that they had formed the plan to aid in this contribution.<p>For which I boast of you to them of Macedonia - To the church in Macedonia; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1</a>. So well assured was he that the church at Corinth would make the collection as it had proposed, that he boasted of it to the churches of Macedonia as if it were already done, and made use of this as an argument to stimulate them to make an effort.<p>That Achaia was ready a year ago - Achaia was that part of Greece of which Corinth was the capital; see the note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>. It is probable that there were Christians in other parts of Achaia besides Corinth, and indeed it is known that there was a church in Cenchrea (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>). which was one of the ports of Corinth. Though the contribution would be chiefly derived from Corinth, yet it is probable that the others also would participate in it. The phrase "was ready" means that they had been preparing themselves for this collection, and doubtless Paul had stated that the collection was already made and was waiting. He had directed them <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> to make it on the first day of the week, and to lay it by in store, and he did not doubt that they had complied with his request.<p>And your zeal - Your ardor and promptitude. The readiness with which you entered into this subject, and your desire to relieve the needs of others.<p>Hath provoked - Has roused, excited, impelled to give. We use the word "provoke" commonly now in the sense of to irritate, but in the Scriptures it is confined to the signification of exciting, or rousing. The ardor of the Corinthians would excite others not only by their promptitude, but because Corinth was a splendid city, and their example would be looked up to by Christians at a distance. This is one instance of the effect which will be produced by the example of a church in a city. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. ready a year ago&#8212;to send off the money, owing to the apostle's former exhortation (1Co 16:1, 2).<p>your zeal&#8212;Greek, "the zeal from you," that is, on your part; propagated from you to others.<p>provoked&#8212;that is, stimulated.<p>very many&#8212;Greek, "the greater number," namely, of the Macedonians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He gives them the reason why he judgeth it superfluous to write to them, because they had a forward mind of themselves, and needed not to be spurred on. This the apostle tells them that he knew, (he had told them of it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.">2 Corinthians 8:10</a></span>), he knew it either from themselves, or from some that came from them unto him; and he had boasted of them for this their forwardness in this good work to the churches of Macedonia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And your zeal hath provoked very many; </span> he tells them, that their warmth unto, and in, this work, had kindled a heat in many in those parts where he was. Having therefore been so forward in this good work, and so good instruments to kindle a heat in others, he would not have them now come behind others, or grow cold in it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For I know the forwardness of your mind,.... How that they were willing of themselves to engage in this good work; how readily they came into it; what a cheerful disposition of mind they showed towards it; and how forward they were to begin the collection: <p>for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia; he had one it before, which had put them upon the like service, and he still continued to boast of them, <p>that Achaia was ready a year ago: not that their collection was ready made so long ago; but they had shown a readiness of mind, as to every good work, so to this of communicating to the saints a year ago, when they made a beginning, though as yet had not finished. By Achaia is meant, the inhabitants of Achaia. The Arabic version renders it, the citizens of Achaia; of this country; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>. It is sometimes taken in a large sense, and designs Greece, and includes the countries of Doris, Hellas, Aetolia, Locri, Phocis, Boeotia, Attica, and Megaris; and had its name, as some say, from the frequent inundation of waters; and others, from one of the three generals of the Pelasgi, who were of this name; and sometimes it is taken strictly and properly for the country of the Peloponnesus, or the Morea. And so Drusius, out of Hesychius, has observed, that the Achaeans were Greeks; but properly they were they that inhabited that part of Peloponnesus, called Achaia; and these seem to be intended here. The Gospel was preached in these parts with success; Epaenetus, whom the Apostle Paul salutes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a> and the house of Stephanas he mentions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a> were the firstfruits of it; and in process of time several churches were here gathered, and which continued for several ages. In the "second" century there was a synod in Achaia, concerning the time of keeping Easter, in which Bacchylus, bishop of Corinth, presided; in the beginning of the "fourth" century, the bishops of Achaia were present at the council of Nice, and in the same century bishops out of this country assisted at the synod in Sardica; in the "fifth" century there were many churches in Achaia, and the bishops of them were present in the Chalcedon synod; out of this country went several bishops, in the "seventh" century, to Constantinople, and were in the sixth synod there; and in the "eighth" century there were bishops of Achaia in the Nicene synod (d): here by Achaia are designed the churches of Christ, which were in that part of Greece in which Corinth stood, and of which that was the metropolis; so that when the apostle says Achaia was ready, his meaning is more particularly, that the Corinthians were ready: <p>and, adds he, <p>your zeal hath provoked very many: or "the zeal which is of you"; which sprung from, and was occasioned by them; for not the zeal of the Corinthians is here intended, as seems at first view, but that emulation which was stirred up in some of the leading persons among the Macedonians, upon hearing how ready they at Corinth were to minister to the necessitous brethren; and the zeal which appeared in these principal men, which was very warm, and yet prudent and seasonable, wrought very much on the minds of others, who, led by their example, contributed in a very generous and unexpected manner. In the Greek text it is, "the zeal out of you"; or, as the Arabic version renders it, "the zeal that arose from you", which was occasioned by them. <p>(d) Hist. Eccles.
