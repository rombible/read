Originally it expressed the act of one who undertook to defray the expenses of the chorus of a Greek theatre. As this was an act of somewhat stately generosity, the verb got a wider range, and was applied to any such act, and was so transferred in like manner by the Apostle, probably, as far as we can trace, for the first time, to the divine bounty. It may be noted that it was not so used by the LXX. translators. The word indeed occurs but once in that version, in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/25-22.htm" title="A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach.">Ecclesiasticus 25:22</a> (“if a woman <span class= "ital">maintain</span> her husband”). In its higher sense it becomes a somewhat favourite word with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>), and is used by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm" title="For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:11</a>) after he had become acquainted with St. Paul’s Epistles, and possibly enriched his vocabulary through them.<p>The phrase “seed to the sower” occurs, with a different verb, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm" title="For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and returns not thither, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:">Isaiah 55:10</a>. In the words that follow, “the fruits of righteousness,” there is an obvious reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm" title="Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness on you.">Hosea 10:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm" title="Shall horses run on the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for you have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:">Amos 6:12</a>. The phrase occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Philippians 1:11</a>. The construction, according to the better MSS., varies somewhat from that of the Authorised version. <span class= "ital">He that bounteously giveth seed to the sower and bread for food</span> (the beneficence of God thought of, as shown both in seed-time and harvest) <span class= "ital">shall give bounteously, and multiply your seed, and increase the produce of your righteousness.</span> “Righteousness” is taken, as before, as specially presented under the aspect of alms-giving.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)...">2 Corinthians 9:10-14</a>. </span><span class="ital">Now he that ministereth seed to the sower </span>— By making the earth fruitful; <span class="ital">and bread for your food — </span>(So Bengelius reads,) namely, all things needful for your souls and bodies. <span class="ital">May he supply and multiply </span>(<span class="greekheb">χορηγησαι και πληθυναι</span>) <span class="ital">your seed sown </span>— Your ability to help others; and <span class="ital">increase the fruits of your righteousness </span>— The happy effects of your love to God and man: or may he make an ample return for what you have liberally bestowed on the indigent, and abundantly increase and reward your works of mercy and charity. <span class="ital">Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness </span>— Plentifully furnished with all things that may enable you to exercise the greatest bounty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-18.htm" title="That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;">1 Timothy 6:18</a>. <span class="ital">Which causeth through us thanksgiving to God </span>— Both from us who distribute, and them who receive your bounty. <span class="ital">For the administration of this service </span>— Which we have undertaken, and in which we do as it were officiate for you, in the presentation of this acceptable offering; <span class="ital">not only supplieth the wants of the saints </span>— In their present exigency; <span class="ital">but is abundant by many thanksgivings</span> — Which it occasions, to the glory of God. The word <span class="greekheb">λειτουργια</span>, rendered <span class="ital">service, </span>in the first clause of the verse, intimates that their contributing to the relief of the poor saints in Judea, was to be considered not merely as an act of humanity, but of religion, most pleasing to God, and suitable to the nature of the gospel. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm" title="But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.">Hebrews 13:16</a>. <span class="ital">While by the experiment </span>— Or proof by experience; <span class="ital">of this ministration </span>— This generous contribution; <span class="ital">they glorify God </span>— Giving him praise; <span class="ital">for your professed subjection </span>— This open testimony of your sincere obedience; <span class="ital">to the gospel of Christ — </span>Which so strictly enjoins works of charity; <span class="ital">for your liberal distribution </span>— Or communication of your goods to them in their present distress; <span class="ital">and to all men </span>— In the like circumstances. <span class="ital">And by their prayers for you </span>— It also produces many prayers to God for you from the poor saints; <span class="ital">who long after you </span>— Have a great affection for you, and are very desirous of your welfare; <span class="ital">for the exceeding grace of God in you </span>— Which produces fruits so much for the glory of God, the good of your fellow-creatures, and so highly ornamental to Christianity. The reader will observe, that in this passage, the apostle mentions four different fruits of alms-giving: the relief of the poor, thanksgiving to God from the poor for that relief, the honour done to God by good works, and lastly, the prayers of the poor for their benefactors, proceeding from gratitude and love.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:6-15 Money bestowed in charity, may to the carnal mind seem thrown away, but when given from proper principles, it is seed sown, from which a valuable increase may be expected. It should be given carefully. Works of charity, like other good works, should be done with thought and design. Due thought, as to our circumstances, and those we are about to relieve, will direct our gifts for charitable uses. Help should be given freely, be it more or less; not grudgingly, but cheerfully. While some scatter, and yet increase; others withhold more than is meet, and it tends to poverty. If we had more faith and love, we should waste less on ourselves, and sow more in hope of a plentiful increase. Can a man lose by doing that with which God is pleased? He is able to make all grace abound towards us, and to abound in us; to give a large increase of spiritual and of temporal good things. He can make us to have enough in all things; and to be content with what we have. God gives not only enough for ourselves, but that also wherewith we may supply the wants of others, and this should be as seed to be sown. We must show the reality of our subjection to the gospel, by works of charity. This will be for the credit of our profession, and to the praise and glory of God. Let us endeavour to copy the example of Christ, being unwearied in doing good, and deeming it more blessed to give than to receive. Blessed be God for the unspeakable gift of his grace, whereby he enables and inclines some of his people to bestow upon others, and others to be grateful for it; and blessed be his glorious name to all eternity, for Jesus Christ, that inestimable gift of his love, through whom this and every other good thing, pertaining to life and godliness, are freely given unto us, beyond all expression, measure, or bounds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now he that ministereth seed to the sower - This is an expression of an earnest wish. In the previous verses he had stated the promises, or had shown what we had a right to expect as a consequence of liberality. He here unites the expression of an earnest desire that they might experience this themselves. The allusion is to the act of sowing seed. The idea is, that when a man scatters seed in his field God provides him with the means of sowing again. He not only gives him a harvest to supply his needs, but he blesses him also in giving him the ability to sow again. Such was the benevolent wish of Paul. He desired not only that God would supply their returning needs, but he desired also that he would give them the ability to do good again; that he would furnish them the means of future benevolence. He acknowledges God as the source of all increase, and wishes that they may experience the results of such increase. Perhaps in this language there is an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-10.htm">Isaiah 4:10</a>; and the idea is, that it is God who furnishes by his providence the seed to the sower. In like manner he will furnish you the means of doing good.<p>Minister bread for your food - Furnish you with an ample supply for your needs.<p>Multiply your seed sown - Greatly increase your means of doing good; make the result of all your benefactions so to abound that you may have the means of doing good again, and on a larger scale, as the seed sown in the earth is so increased that the farmer may have the means of sowing more abundantly again.<p>And increase the fruits of your righteousness - This evidently means, the results and effects of their benevolence. The word "righteousness" here refers to their liberality; and the wish of the apostle is, that the results of their beneficence might greatly abound, that they might have the means of doing extensive good, and that they might be the means of diffusing happiness from afar. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Some Greek copies read these words in the future tense, according to which reading they are a formal promise, both of good things, whereby they might show their charity, and also of a free and large heart, disposing them to that exercise of grace. Our translators render it in the form of a prayer; which yet being the prayer of the apostle, put up in faith, doth virtually contain a promise both of a temporal and a spiritual increase. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now he that ministereth seed to the sower, and bread for your food,.... For so the words ought to be pointed and read, as is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a> to which they refer; and are a "periphrasis" of God, who so blesses the seed that is cast into the earth, that it brings forth such an increase, as that there is a sufficiency of bread for food to the eater for the present year, and a sufficiency of seed to sow with again the next year; and that God, that does this every year, is able "to minister to", or supply your present necessities; <p>and to multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness; though some consider these as a wish or prayer of the apostle's, that God would do all this for them. Some copies, and the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, read all in the future tense, "he will minister" to you, or "supply" you, "and will multiply your seed sown", <p>and will increase the fruits of your righteousness; and so contain a promise of a divine blessing, encouraging to liberality with cheerfulness, by strengthening their faith in the providence of God; who as he multiplies, not the seed expended in the family, or sold at market, or as in the barn, or laid up for a better price, but the seed sown in the field, so he will multiply the substance of men; not what they lay out on themselves and families, or lay up in their coffers, but what they give away, or bestow on Christ's poor: and all effects which follow acts of liberality, and which are here designed by "fruits of righteousness", such as a good name among men, blessing, praise, thanksgiving, and prosperity in things temporal and spiritual, these God will abundantly increase; some of which are mentioned in the following verses. So alms with the Jews is not only called  "righteousness", but "seed sown". Thus Jarchi interprets <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-26.htm">Psalm 37:26</a> "and his seed is blessed", he that  "sows" righteousness or alms, its end shall be for a blessing, or in the end he shall be blessed; and the phrase, "rain righteousness", in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a> is by the Septuagint rendered, , "fruits of righteousness", the same as here, from whence it seems to be taken. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for <i>your</i> food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> fruits of your righteousness;)</span><p>(i) There is no inheritance as good to the godly as bountifulness is.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>.

This would be at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm" title="For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and returns not thither, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:">Isaiah 55:10</a>, and would destroy the symmetrical relation of the two parts of the vers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χορηγήσει</span>[290] <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πληθυνεῖ τὸν σπόρον ὑμῶν</span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> dropping the figure: <span class="ital">will give and increase the means, with which you distribute benefits</span>. What is given away benevolently by the readers, is <span class="ital">the seed which they scatter</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὁ σπόρος αὐτῶν</span>); hence Rückert’s idea is arbitrary and unnecessary, that here two clauses, <span class="greekheb">χορηγήσει ὑμῖν σπόρον</span> and <span class="greekheb">πληθυνεῖ τὸν σπόρον ὑμῶν</span>, are blended into one. Rückert also inappropriately thinks that Paul is not speaking at all of the present, but <span class="ital">wholly of the future</span>, of the blessed consequences of their beneficence now asked, and that <span class="greekheb">ὁ σπόρος</span>, therefore, does not denote what they were now to give away, but <span class="ital">what God will further bestow on them</span>. At variance with the entire course of the passage (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm" title="And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:">2 Corinthians 9:8</a> ff.); and the very <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἡμῶν</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-11.htm" title="Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God.">2 Corinthians 9:11</a> ought to have prevented the excluding of the present time.

Paul abides by the figure. Just as God causes <span class="greekheb">ἄρτον εἰς βρῶσιν</span> to grow from the natural seed, so from <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="greekheb">σπόρος</span>, which the beneficent scatters through his gifts of love, He likewise causes fruits (blessings) to grow; but because this <span class="greekheb">σπόρος</span> had been sown by the beneficent man <span class="ital">in virtue of his Christian righteousness</span>, the fruits produced are the <span class="greekheb">γεννήματα τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ</span>, just as the bread-fruits, which the husbandman obtains from his <span class="greekheb">σπόρος</span>, are the <span class="greekheb">γεννήματα</span> of his diligence.
