It is clear that he speaks here not of any deliverance from danger or disease, but of the resurrection of which he had spoken so fully in 1 Corinthians 15. The better MSS. give <span class= "ital">with Jesus,</span> the Received text having apparently originated in a desire to adapt the words to the fact that Christ had already risen. St. Paul’s thoughts, however, dwell so continually on his fellowship with Christ that he thinks of the future resurrection of the body, no less than of the spiritual resurrection which he has already experienced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>), as not only wrought <span class= "ital">by</span> Him but associated <span class= "ital">with</span> Him; and in this hope of his he includes the Corinthians to whom he writes. It will then be seen, he trusts, that “life” has indeed been “working” in them. The verb “present,” as describing the work of Christ, and, we may add, his own work as a minister of Christ, under this aspect, is a favourite one with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 The grace of faith is an effectual remedy against fainting in times of trouble. They knew that Christ was raised, and that his resurrection was an earnest and assurance of theirs. The hope of this resurrection will encourage in a suffering day, and set us above the fear of death. Also, their sufferings were for the advantage of the church, and to God's glory. The sufferings of Christ's ministers, as well as their preaching and conversation, are for the good of the church and the glory of God. The prospect of eternal life and happiness was their support and comfort. What sense was ready to pronounce heavy and long, grievous and tedious, faith perceived to be light and short, and but for a moment. The weight of all temporal afflictions was lightness itself, while the glory to come was a substance, weighty, and lasting beyond description. If the apostle could call his heavy and long-continued trials light, and but for a moment, what must our trifling difficulties be! Faith enables to make this right judgment of things. There are unseen things, as well as things that are seen. And there is this vast difference between them; unseen things are eternal, seen things but temporal, or temporary only. Let us then look off from the things which are seen; let us cease to seek for worldly advantages, or to fear present distresses. Let us give diligence to make our future happiness sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing - Being fully confident; having the most entire assurance. It was the assured hope of the resurrection which sustained them in all their trials.

In the hope of the resurrection they were ready to meet trials, and even to die.

And we are from this text confirmed in the truth of this, that although the lot of God’s people in this life be very different, (some are poor, some rich, some in prosperity, some in adversity, and encompassed with sorrows and afflictions), yet if they have all the same faith, they shall all meet in the resurrection, and shall, by Christ, be all presented unto God as persons redeemed by him, and washed with his blood, and who shall be glorified together. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus,.... Besides having the same spirit of faith, mentioned in the preceding verse as a support under tribulation, the apostle proceeds in this, and some following verses, to take notice of other things which gave them relief under their pressures; such as the resurrection from the dead, all their afflictions being for the good of the churches and glory of God, the inward and comfortable experiences of the love and grace of God in the midst of them, and the end and issue of them, eternal glory. The former of these is observed here; "knowing", being firmly persuaded, and fully assured, that he "which raised up the Lord Jesus"; by whom God the Father is more especially designed, though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, who were jointly concerned in raising the dead body of our Lord: shall raise us up also by Jesus; which may regard the resurrection of all the saints by Christ, not as a mere instrument, but as a co-efficient cause with the Father and Spirit: this the apostle concludes from the power of God in raising up Christ from the dead; he that is able to do the one, is certainly of power to effect the other; and also from that union there is between Christ and his people; he is the head, they are his members; and because the head is raised, the members shall be likewise. Christ's resurrection is not only the pattern, but the pledge of the resurrection of the saints. Now this doctrine, as it was fully known, and firmly believed by the apostles, was of great use to bear them up under their outward troubles; for though they were so afflicted and persecuted, death was visibly working in them, and they might expect in a short time to be laid in the grave; yet this was their consolation, that they should be raised again immortal and glorious by Christ; some copies read, "with Jesus", and so the Vulgate Latin version: "he shall present us with you"; that is, he will present us ministers, together with you the saints, and the rest of the elect of God; first,  "to himself", as the Syriac version adds, and then to his Father, in their full number, completely righteous and holy. These words indeed may be understood of a deliverance from temporal affliction, from that death they were labouring under, and exposed unto, and the sense be this; we firmly believe that he that raised up Christ from the dead, will deliver us from the present death of affliction, which will be a sort of resurrection from the dead, and will make us to stand by you, or in your presence; or, in other words, being thus delivered, we shall have an opportunity of visiting you, we have so long desired, and you have expected, which will be to your edification and comfort. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>. <span class="ital">Encouraging assurance</span> accompanying this <span class="greekheb">λαλοῦμεν</span> (not its <span class="ital">contents</span>); <span class="ital">since we are certain that</span>, etc. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm" title="And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;">Romans 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-58.htm" title="Therefore, my beloved brothers, be you steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐγείρας τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησ</span>.] Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>.

Hence there is no ground for explaining it, with Beza (who, however, again abandoned this view), Calixtus (“<span class="ital">suscitabit</span> a morte sc. illa <span class="ital">quotidiana</span>”), Schulz, Rückert, Neander, of the resurrection <span class="ital">in a figurative sense</span>, viz. <span class="ital">of the overcoming the constant perils of death</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body....">2 Corinthians 4:10-12</a>), which, it is held, is a resurrection <span class="ital">with Jesus</span>, in so far as through it there arises a fellowship of destiny with the risen Christ. This interpretation is not demanded by the correct reading <span class="greekheb">σὺν Ἰησοῦ</span>, as if this <span class="greekheb">σὺν</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a> f.) presupposed the <span class="ital">spiritual</span> meaning.

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm" title="But why do you judge your brother? or why do you set at nothing your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.">Romans 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>; Jude 24; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm" title="But meat commends us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>, and note.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰδότες</span>, <span class="ital">knowing</span>) by great <span class="ital">faith</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">παραστήσει</span>, <span class="ital">shall present</span>) This word places the matter as it were under our eyes [Hypotyposis; a vivid word-picture of some action, Append.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which raised up the Lord Jesus</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-14.htm">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Shall raise up us also. The thought is again expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>. As he is here alluding mainly to the resurrection from the dead, it is clear that he contemplated the <span class="accented">possibility</span> of dying before Christ's second coming (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By Jesus.</span> The reading supported by nearly all the best manuscripts is "with Jesus" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, D, E, F, G), which perhaps appeared unsuitable to the copyists. But Christians are "risen with Christ" here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>); and in another sense also we rise <span class="accented">with</span> him, because the Church is "the body of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall present us with you.</span> So St. Jude speaks of "God our Saviour" as able "to present us" before the presence of his glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-24.htm">Jude 1:24, 25</a>). </body></html>
