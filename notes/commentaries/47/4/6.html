And that mercy which has helped us out, and helped us on, hitherto, we may rely upon to help us even to the end. The apostles had no base and wicked designs, covered with fair and specious pretences. They did not try to make their ministry serve a turn. Sincerity or uprightness will keep the favourable opinion of wise and good men. Christ by his gospel makes a glorious discovery to the minds of men. But the design of the devil is, to keep men in ignorance; and when he cannot keep the light of the gospel of Christ out of the world, he spares no pains to keep men from the gospel, or to set them against it. The rejection of the gospel is here traced to the wilful blindness and wickedness of the human heart. Self was not the matter or the end of the apostles' preaching; they preached Christ as Jesus, the Saviour and Deliverer, who saves to the uttermost all that come to God through him. Ministers are servants to the souls of men; they must avoid becoming servants to the humours or the lusts of men. It is pleasant to behold the sun in the firmament; but it is more pleasant and profitable for the gospel to shine in the heart. As light was the beginning of the first creation; so, in the new creation, the light of the Spirit is his first work upon the soul. The treasure of gospel light and grace is put into earthen vessels. The ministers of the gospel are subject to the same passions and weaknesses as other men. God could have sent angels to make known the glorious doctrine of the gospel, or could have sent the most admired sons of men to teach the nations, but he chose humbler, weaker vessels, that his power might be more glorified in upholding them, and in the blessed change wrought by their ministry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For God, who commanded ... - The design of this verse seems to be, to give a reason why Paul and his fellow-apostles did not preach themselves, but Jesus Christ the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>. That reason was, that their minds had been so illuminated by that God who had commanded the light to shine out of darkness, that they had discerned the glory of the divine perfections shining in and through the Redeemer, and they therefore gave themselves. to the work of making him known among people. The doctrines which they preached they had not derived from people in any form. They had not been elaborated by human reasoning or science, nor had they been imparted by tradition. They had been communicated directly by the source of all light - the true God - who had shined into the hearts that were once benighted by sin. Having been thus illuminated, they had felt themselves bound to go and make known to others the truths which God had imparted to them.<p>Who commanded the light ... - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>. God caused it to shine by his simple command. He said, "let there be light, and there was light." The fact that it was produced by "his saying so" is referred to here by Paul by his use of the phrase (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;  ho eipo&#772;n) "Who saying," or speaking the light to shine from darkness. The passage in Genesis is adduced by Longinus as a striking instance of the sublime.<p>Hath shined in our hearts - Margin, "It is he who hath." This is more in accordance with the Greek, and the sense is, "The God who at the creation bade the light to shine out of darkness, is he who has shined into our hearts; or it is the same God who has illuminated us, who commanded the light to shine at the creation." "Light" is every where in the Bible the emblem of knowledge, purity, and truth; as darkness is the emblem of ignorance, error, sin, and wretchedness. See note, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>. And the sense here is, that God had removed this ignorance, and poured a flood of light and truth on their minds. This passage teaches, therefore, the following important truths in regard to Christians - since it is as applicable to all Christians, as it was to the apostles:<p>(1) That the mind is by nature ignorant and benighted - to an extent which may be properly compared with the darkness which prevailed before God commanded the light to shine. Indeed, the darkness which prevailed before the light was formed, was a most striking emblem of the darkness which exists in the mind of man before it is enlightened by revelation, and by the Holy Spirit. For:<p>(a) In all minds by nature there is deep ignorance of God, of His Law, and His requirements; and,<p>(b) This is often greatly deepened by the course of life which people lead; by their education; or by their indulgence in sin, and by their plans of life; and especially by the indulgence of evil passions.<p>The tendency of man if left to himself is to plunge into deeper darkness, and to involve his mind more entirely in the obscurity of moral midnight. "Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>.<p>(2) this verse teaches the fact, that the minds of Christians are illuminated. They are enabled to see things as they are. This fact is often taught in the Scriptures; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12-15</a>. They have different views of things from their fellow-men, and different from what they once had. They perceive a beauty in religion which others do not see, and a glory in truth, and in the Saviour, and in the promises of the gospel, which they did not see before they were converted. This does not mean:<p>(a) That they are superior in their powers of understanding to other people - for the reverse is often the fact; nor,<p>(b) That the effect of religion is at once to enlarge their own intellectual powers, and make them different from what they were before in this respect.<p>But it means that they have clear and consistent views; they look at things as they are; they perceive a beauty in religion and in the service of God which they did not before. They see a beauty in the Bible, and in the doctrines of the Bible, which they did not before, and which sinners do not see. The temperate man will see a beauty in temperance, and in an argument for temperance, which the drunkard will not; the benevolent man will see a beauty in benevolence which the churl will not: and so of honesty, truth, and chastity. And especially will a man who is reformed from intemperance, impurity, dishonesty, and avarice, see a beauty in a virtuous life which he did not before see. There is indeed no immediate and direct enlargement of the intellect; but there is an effect on the heart which produces an appropriate and indirect effect on the understanding.<p>It is at the same time true, that the practice of virtue, that a pure heart, and that the cultivation of piety all tend to regulate, strengthen, and expand the intellect, as the ways of vice and the indulgence of evil passions and propensities tend to enfeeble, paralyze, darken, and ruin the understanding; so that, other things being equal, the man of most decided virtue, and most calm and elevated piety, will be the man of the clearest and best regulated mind. His powers will be the most assiduously, carefully, and conscientiously cultivated and he will feel himself bound to make the most of them. The influence of piety in giving light to the mind is often strikingly manifested among unlettered and ignorant Christians. It often happens, as a matter of fact, that they have by far clearer, and more just and elevated views of truth than people of the most mighty intellects, and most highly cultivated by science and adorned with learning. but who have no piety; and a practical acquaintance with their own hearts, and a practical experience of the power of religion in the days of temptation and trial is a better enlightener of the mind on the subject of religion than all the learning of the schools.<p>(3) this verse teaches, that it is the "same God" who enlightens the mind of the Christian that commanded the light at first to shine. He is the source of all light. He formed the light in the natural world; he gives all light and truth on all subjects to the understanding; and he imparts all correct views of truth to the heart. Light is not originated by man; and man on the subject of religion no more creates the light which beams upon his benighted mind than he created the light of the sun when it first shed its beams over the darkened earth. "All truth is from the sempiternal source of light divine;" and it is no more the work of man to enlighten the mind. and dissipate the darkness from the soul of a benighted sinner, than it was of man to scatter the darkness that brooded over the creation, or than he can now turn the shades of midnight to noonday. All this work lies beyond the proper province of man; and is all to be traced to the agency of God - the great fountain of light.<p>(4) it is taught here that it is the "same power" that gives light to the mind of the Christian which at first commanded the light to shine out of darkness. It requires the exertion of the same Omnipotence; and the change is often as remarkable, and surprising. Nothing can be conceived to be more grand than the first creation of light - when by one word the whole solar system was in a blaze. And nothing in the moral world is more grand than when by a word God commands the light to beam on the soul of a benighted sinner. Night is at once changed to day; and all things are seen in a blaze of glory. The works of God appear different; the Word of God appears different; and a new aspect of beauty is diffused over all things. If it be asked in what way God thus imparts light to the mind, we may reply:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The causal particle for, shows these words to be also a reason of the foregoing; either why they so clearly beheld the glory of the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a> or why they renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a> or why their Gospel could not be hid, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3</a> or why they did not preach themselves, but Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a> because God had <p>shined in their hearts; and in this light, they saw the glory of Christ; could not bear any secret, hidden, scandalous practices; and held forth the word of light and life to others; and seeing so much of their own weakness, sinfulness, and unworthiness, dared not to preach themselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; in which may be observed the character of the true God, as opposed to Satan, the god of this world, who is said to blind the minds of men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a> whereas the true God is represented as the author of "light", and as producing it by a word of "command", and that "out" of mere "darkness"; respect is here had to the creation of all things at the beginning, when "darkness was upon the face of the deep--and God said, let there be light and there was light", <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. Now this character of God, as creating light in this wonderful manner, is prefaced to his giving spiritual light unto his people; because of the agreement there is between light corporeal and spiritual, in their nature and production; for as there was darkness upon the earth before there was light, so there is a natural darkness in the minds of men, before any spiritual light is infused into them; and as light was the first production out of the dark and unformed chaos, so light is the first thing that is struck into the soul in conversion; moreover, as light was the effect of almighty power, so is the spiritual illumination, or the opening of the eyes of the understandings of men, who are naturally born blind; and as light was a creation of that which was not before, so the work of grace on the soul is not an increase of, or an addition to, or an improvement of the light of nature, but it is a new light, created in the understanding; add to all this, that both corporeal and spiritual light are good, and both called "day"; the influence that God has over the hearts of men, and the effect he produces there are, he <p>hath shined in our hearts. The hearts of men are like this dark terraqueous globe, having no light in them; God is as the sun, the fountain of light, which shines upon them and in them; so as to give them a true sight and sense of sin, and of their lost state and condition; so as to cause them to see the fulness and suitableness of Christ as a Saviour; so as to warm their affections, and draw out their desires after Christ, his ways, truths, ordinances, and people; and so as to give them light into the mysteries of the Gospel; particularly he so shines into the hearts of some, whom be makes ministers of the Gospel, as to give more light and knowledge into Gospel truths, than he does to others; and his end in doing this, is <p>to give: that is, that his ministering servants may give <p>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; men must be first made light in, and by the Lord, or they will never be fit and proper persons to hold forth the word of light, or to communicate light to others; God first shines into their hearts, and then they give light to others: by "the glory of God" is not meant the essential glory of God, or the perfections of his nature, though these are to be seen in the face, or person of Christ; but rather the glorious counsels of God, and scheme of salvation by Jesus Christ; or in other words, the glorious Gospel of God: and by "the knowledge" of it is designed, not a mere notional speculative knowledge of the Gospel, but an experimental one; a spiritual knowledge of the Gospel, of Christ in it, of God in Christ, and of an interest in God's salvation by Christ: now when the ministers of the word are said to give the light of this to men, or to enlighten them with this knowledge, it cannot be thought that they are the efficient causes, for such are only Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit; but only that they are instrumental, and are means in the hands of God, of bringing persons to see the fellowship of this mystery: all which is done, "in the face of Jesus Christ"; this denotes the clearness and perspicuity of their ministry, and of that knowledge which is communicated by it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12</a> and also the authority by which they act; it is in the name and person of Christ, in which sense the phrase is used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-10.htm">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For God, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to <i>give</i> the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</span><p>(g) Who made with his word alone.<p>(h) That being enlightened by God, we should in the same way give that light to others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>.

Hofmann, in consequence of his referring <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὅς</span></span></span> to Christ, wrongly explains it: “<span class="ital">within</span> them has been repeated that which took place in the world <span class="ital">when Christ appeared in it</span>.” On the point itself in reference to <span class="ital">Paul</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρὸς φωτισμὸν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">for the purpose of lighting</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), etc., equivalent to <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸ φωτίζειν τὴν γνῶσιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">in order that there may lighten</span>, etc., by which is set forth the thought: “in order that the knowledge of the divine glory may be conveyed and diffused from us to others through the preaching of Christ.” For if the knowledge remains undiffused, it has not the nature of a thing that lightens, whose light is received by the eyes of me.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ</span>] belongs to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῸς ΦΩΤΙΣΜΌΝ</span></span></span>, but cannot be explained <span class="ital">in persona Christi</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">in nomine Christi</span>, as Estius explains it after the Latin Fathers, but it specifies <span class="ital">where</span> the knowledge of the divine glory is to lighten: <span class="ital">in the presence of Christ</span>. For Christ is <span class="greekheb">εἰκὼν τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, and Christians see unveiled the glory of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. He, therefore, who converts others to Christ makes the knowledge of the divine glory become <span class="ital">clear-shining</span> to them, and that <span class="ital">in the countenance of the Lord</span>, which is beheld in the gospel as the reflection of the divine glory, so that in this seen countenance that clear-shining knowledge has the <span class="ital">source</span> of its <span class="ital">light</span> (as it were, its focus). Probably there is in <span class="greekheb">ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ</span> a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm" title="But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>.

The objection of de Wette against our view—an objection raised substantially by Hofmann also—that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΝῶΣΙς</span></span></span> is the subjective possession of the apostle, and cannot therefore become light-giving in the face of Christ, leaves out of consideration the fact that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΝῶΣΙς</span></span></span> is <span class="ital">objectivised</span>. Conveyed through preaching, the <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> of the divine glory <span class="ital">gives light</span> (it would <span class="ital">not</span> give light otherwise), and its light-giving has its seat and source of issue <span class="ital">on the countenance of Christ</span>, because it is this, the glory of which is brought to view in the mirror of preaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Note, further, how there is something clumsy but <span class="ital">majestic</span> in the entire mode of expression, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span>, especially in the accumulation of the four genitives, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[194] Comp. also Buttmann, <span class="ital">neatest.
