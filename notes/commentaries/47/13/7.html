We have far more need to pray that we may not do evil, than that we may not suffer evil. The apostle not only desired that they might be kept from sin, but also that they might grow in grace, and increase in holiness. We are earnestly to pray to God for those we caution, that they may cease to do evil, and learn to do well; and we should be glad for others to be strong in the grace of Christ, though it may be the means of showing our own weakness. let us also pray that we may be enabled to make a proper use of all our talents.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now I pray to God that ye do no evil - I earnestly desire that you may do right, and only right; and I beseech God that it may be so, whatever may be the result in regard to me, and whatever may be thought of my claims to the apostolic office. This is designed to mitigate the apparent severity of the sentiment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-6.htm">2 Corinthians 13:6</a>. There he had said that they would find him fully endowed with the power of an apostle. They would see that he was able abundantly to punish the disobedient. They would have ample demonstration that he was endowed by Christ with all the powers appropriate to an apostle, and that all that he had claimed had been well founded, all that he threatened would be executed. But this seemed to imply that he desired that there should be occasion for the exercise of that power of administering discipline; and he, therefore, in this verse, removes all suspicion that such was his wish, by saying solemnly, that he prayed to God that they might never do wrong; that they might never give him occasion for the exercise of his power in that way, though as a consequence he would be regarded as a reprobate, or as having no claims to the apostolic office. He would rather be regarded as an impostor; rather lie under the reproach of his enemies that he had no claims to the apostolic character, than that they, by doing wrong, should give him occasion to show that he was not a deceiver.<p>Not that we should appear approved - My great object, and my main desire, is not to urge my claims to the apostolic office and clear up my own character; it is that you should lead honest lives, whatever may become of me and my reputation.<p>Though we be as reprobates - I am willing to be regarded as rejected, disapproved, worthless, like base metal, provided you lead honest and holy lives. I prefer to be so esteemed, and to have you live as becomes Christians, than that you should dishonor your Christian profession, and thus afford me the opportunity of demonstrating, by inflicting punishment, that I am commissioned by the Lord Jesus to be an apostle. The sentiment is, that a minister of the gospel should desire that his people should walk worthy of their high calling, whatever may be the estimate in which he is held. He should never desire that they should do wrong - how can he do it? - in order that he may take occasion from their wrongdoing to vindicate, in any way, his own character, or to establish a reputation for skill in administering discipline or in governing a church. What a miserable condition it is - and as wicked as it is miserable - for a man to wish to take advantage of a state of disorder, or of the faults of others, in order to establish his own character, or to obtain reputation. Paul spurned and detested such a thought; yet it is to be feared it is sometimes done. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

A strong mark of the apostle's affection for them. For though they used him so ill, he took every way and method to do them good; he not only wrote to them, sent the brethren to them, but put up his supplications at the throne of grace for them: The Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions, read, "we pray", &amp;c. And one of his petitions for them was, <p>that ye do no evil; which, though impracticable and impossible, considering the situation of the people of God in this world, yet is desirable by every good man, both for himself and others; and was desired by the apostle, partly that their consciences might not be wounded, their souls grieved, their peace broke in upon, and their comforts lost; and partly that the name of God, and his cause and truths, might not be blasphemed; and chiefly that he might have no opportunity of exercising his apostolical rod for their correction: <p>not that we should appear approved. This was a clear case that he sought their good, and not his own credit, and the exercise of power; if they committed evil, his faithfulness would be seen in reproving, rebuking, and exhorting them; and if they continued impenitent, his apostolical authority would be manifest in their punishment, so that he would appear approved, or with a proof of the power of Christ in him; but this he did not desire, but most earnestly wished there might be no occasion for any such evidence: <p>but that they should do that which is honest; or "good", both in the sight of God and men, that which is according to the will of God, springs from love, is done in faith, and with a view to the glory of God; and the apostle's praying, both that they might be kept from evil, and do that which is good, shows the impotence of man's free will, the necessity of the grace of God to abstain from sin, and perform good works; and this the apostle earnestly desired, <p>though, says be, <p>we be as reprobates; weak and infirm persons, incapable of giving any proof of the power of Christ, and appear as such, who have no marks of apostolical authority. The apostle chose rather to be looked upon as a poor, mean, and insignificant person, than that they should sin, and require the exercise of his chastising rod, whereby he would be seen to be what they called in question. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> reprobates.</span><p>(c) In men's judgment.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-7.htm" title="Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.">2 Corinthians 13:7</a>. Yet we pray to God that this, my apostolic attestation, which I hope to give you means of discerning, may not be made necessary on your part. On <span class="greekheb">εὐχόμεθα</span> (see the critical remarks), compared with the <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίζω</span> used just before, observe that, as often in Paul and especially in this Epistle of vivid emotion, the interchange of the singular and the plural forms of expressing himself has by no means always special grounds by which it is determine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μὴ ποιῆσαι ὑμᾶς κακὸν μηδέν</span>] <span class="ital">that ye may do nothing evil</span>, which, in fact, would only keep up and increase your guilt. Others incorrectly take it,[400] “that I be not compelled <span class="ital">to do something evil to you</span>,” How could Paul have so designated his chastisement? For that <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν κακόν</span> stands here, not in the sense: to do <span class="ital">something to one’s harm</span>, but in the <span class="ital">ethical</span> sense, is shown by the contrast <span class="greekheb">τὸ καλὸν ποιῆτε</span> in what follows. But even apart from this, in fact, because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὐΧΌΜΕΘΑ</span></span></span> receives through <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῸς ΤῸΝ ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span> (comp.

But the accusative with the infinitive occurs as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-19.htm" title="Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:">Acts 26:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἵνα ἡμεῖς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Statement of the object, for which he makes this entreaty to God, first negatively and then positively; not in a selfish design, not in order that <span class="ital">we</span> may appear through your moral conduct as attested (in so far, namely, as the excellence of the disciple is the attestation of the teacher, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:">2 Corinthians 3:2</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore, my brothers dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.">Php 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-20.htm" title="For you are our glory and joy.">1 Thessalonians 2:20</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>), but <span class="ital">on your account</span>, in order that <span class="ital">ye</span> may do what is good, and thus the attestation may be on <span class="ital">your</span> side and we may be as unattested, in so far, namely, as we cannot in that case show ourselves in our apostolic authority (by sternness and execution of punishment).

According to Olshausen, there is meant to be conveyed in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΧ ἽΝΑ ἩΜΕῖς ΔΌΚ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΦΑΝῶΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>: <span class="ital">not in order that the fulfilment of this prayer may appear as an effect of my powerful intercession</span>. But Paul must have <span class="ital">said</span> this, if he had <span class="ital">meant</span> it. Others[401] hold that after <span class="greekheb">οὐχ</span> there is to be supplied <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὔΧΟΜΑΙ</span></span></span>, or the idea of wish implied in it, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> expresses its <span class="ital">contents</span>; “I do not wish that I should show myself as standing the test (that is, stern), but rather that ye may do what is good and I be as not standing the test (that is, may <span class="ital">appear</span> not standing the test, and so not stern),” Billroth. Certainly the contents of <span class="greekheb">εὔχεσθαι</span> might be conceived as its aim, and hence be expressed by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm" title="Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed.
