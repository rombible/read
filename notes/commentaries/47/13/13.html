This comes from the “saints” of Philippi. The phrase, familiar as it is, is not without interest, as showing that St. Paul, wherever he might be, informed the Church of one locality when he was writing to another, and so made them feel that they were all members of the great family of God.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:11-14 Here are several good exhortations.

And let it be our constant aim so to walk, that separation from our friends may be only for a time, and that we may meet in that happy world where parting will be unknown. He wishes that they may partake all the benefits which Christ of his free grace and favour has purchased; the Father out of his free love has purposed; and the Holy Ghost applies and bestows.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the saints salute you - That is, all who were with Paul, or in the place where he was.

But St. Paul has a signature of his own, which he calls the <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον ἐν πάσῃ ἐπιστολῇ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>); <span class="ital">viz.</span>, he always ends with a prayer that Christ’s <span class="ital">grace</span> may rest on his correspondents, either in the form <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰη</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. or in the abbreviated form <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις</span> (as in <span class="ital">Eph., Col.</span> and the Pastorals). Here, and here only, he fills it out so as to embrace the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity. Possibly the phrase the “God of Love” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2 Corinthians 13:11</a> has suggested here mention of the “Love of God,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the love which God has for man; and a prayer for the “Fellowship of the Holy Spirit,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> which is the Spirit’s gift, is a fitting conclusion to a letter addressed to a community agitated by faction and strife and jealousy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>).

It offers a devotional parallel to the Baptismal Formula (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>); and the order of its clauses receives its explanation in later words of St. Paul: <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ ἔχομεν τὴν προσαγωγὴν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι πρὸς f1τὸν πατέρα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>).
