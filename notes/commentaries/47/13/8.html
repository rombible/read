The first impression which the words convey is that he is asserting his own thoroughness as a champion of the truth, so that it was a moral impossibility for him to do anything against it. The true sequence of thought, however, though it does not exclude that meaning, compels us to read much more between the lines. “Yes,” he says, “we are content to seem to fail, as regards the exercise of our apostolic power to chastise offenders; for the condition of that power is that it is never exercised against the truth, and therefore if you walk in the truth, there will be no opening for its exercise.” The feeling is analogous to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a> : “I could wish myself accursed from Christ for my brethren’s sake;” perhaps also to that of the Baptist: “He must increase, but I must decrease” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-30.htm" title="He must increase, but I must decrease.">John 3:30</a>); perhaps, yet again, to that of the patriot dying with the prayer, “May my name be without honour if only my country may be saved.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:7-10 The most desirable thing we can ask of God, for ourselves and our friends, is to be kept from sin, that we and they may not do evil. We have far more need to pray that we may not do evil, than that we may not suffer evil. The apostle not only desired that they might be kept from sin, but also that they might grow in grace, and increase in holiness. We are earnestly to pray to God for those we caution, that they may cease to do evil, and learn to do well; and we should be glad for others to be strong in the grace of Christ, though it may be the means of showing our own weakness. let us also pray that we may be enabled to make a proper use of all our talents.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we - That is, we the apostles.<p>Can do nothing against the truth ... - That is, we who are under the influence of the Spirit of God; who have been commissioned by him as apostles, can do nothing that shall be against the great system of truth which we are appointed to promulgate and defend. You need, therefore, apprehend no partial or severe discipline from us; no unjust construction of your conduct. Our aim is to promote the truth, and to do what is right; and we cannot, therefore, by any regard to our own reputation, or to any personal advantage, do what is wrong, or countenance, or desire what is wrong in others. We must wish that which is right to be done by others, whatever may be the effect on us - whether we are regarded as apostles or deceivers. I suppose, therefore, that this verse is designed to qualify and confirm the sentiment in the previous verse, that Paul meant to do only right; that he wished all others to do right; and that whatever might be the effect on his own reputation, or however he might be regarded, he could not go against the great system of gospel truth which he preached, or even desire that others should ever do wrong, though it might in any way be for his advantage. It was a fixed principle with him to act only in accordance with truth; to do what was right. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Our apostolic power is given us that we may use it not against, but for the furtherance of, the truth. Where you are free from fault, there is no scope for its exercise: and this I desire. Far be it from me to use it against the innocent, merely in order to increase my own power (2Co 13:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Truth</span> in this place notes integrity of life and conversation; truth in action, opposed to hypocrisy, or scandalous living. He had before prayed, that they might <span class="ital">do no evil; </span> which if they did not, they need not fear his coming with a rod; for though he had a power from Christ to punish, yet he had no power to punish such as did well; his power was to be used for them, not against them. As the law was not made for the righteous, and the civil magistrate is not ordained of God for the terror of those that do well, but only of those that do evil; so neither did Christ ever ordain ecclesiastical censures for the punishment of good and holy men. And indeed here is the just boundary of all civil and ecclesiastical power; no magistrate or minister, acting as Christ’s servants, <span class="ital">can</span> (lawfully, or as by any commission from him) do any thing <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">against the truth, </span> or those that own, defend, and practise it; the power with which they are trusted is for edification, not destruction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For we can do nothing against the truth,.... The apostles had no power, nor could they, nor did they desire to exercise any against such who received the truth of the Gospel in the love of it; who continued in it, walked in it, and held it fast; who worshipped God in Spirit and in truth, and who walked uprightly, and as became the truth; for as the law is not made for such persons, but the reverse, so the authority the apostles had received from Christ was not to be exercised upon such: <p>but for the truth: for the sake of defending the truth against those that dropped, denied, and opposed it; and for the honour of it, by chastising, correcting, reproving, censuring, and punishing such, who either contradicted it, or caused it to be blasphemed and spoken evil of. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.">2 Corinthians 13:8</a>. Reason assigned for the relation just expressed as aimed at by <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ὑμεῖς τὸ καλὸν ποιῆτε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς δὲ ὡς ἀδόκιμοι ὦμεν</span>. That we really have this design, is based on the fact that we are not in a position to do anything against the truth, but for the truth. The <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> is to be taken in the habitual sense of the N. T.: the truth <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐξοχήν</span>, the divine truth, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the <span class="ital">gospel</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-7.htm" title="By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>. If Paul, forsooth, had not had the design that the readers should do what is good, and he himself appear without punitive power and consequently as unattested, he would have <span class="ital">counteracted</span> the gospel, in so far as it aims at establishing Christian morality, requires penitence, announces forgiveness to the penitent, etc.; but he is not in a position to do so. To take <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span>, with Flatt and older expositors,[402] as <span class="ital">moral</span> truth (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>), <span class="ital">uprightness</span>, is a limitation of it, which the context all the less suggests, seeing that <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> in the above sense embraces in it the moral element. The taking it in the <span class="ital">judicial</span> sense would be accordant with the context (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀληθῆ φέρωμεν τὴν ψῆφον</span>, Theophylact, so Chrysostom, Theodoret, Grotius: “quod rectum justumque est;” Cornelius a Lapide, Bengel, de Wette: “the true state in which the matter finds itself;” so, too, Räbiger); yet, in that case, there would result an inappropriate contrast, since <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλ</span>. can only mean “<span class="ital">for the benefit</span> of the truth,” which presupposes a more comprehensive idea of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθ</span>.

The principle here laid down is of far widen application than an accurate exegesis can assign to it in its context. It is a <span class="ital">general</span> principle, which Christian theology has not always sufficiently remembered, that to fight against truth, whether ethical or historical or scientific, is to fight against Him who is <span class="ital">the</span> Truth, and so is to court defeat.
