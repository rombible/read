Christ at his crucifixion, appeared as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and life showed his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifested the power of God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, and experience, as gold is assayed or proved by the touchstone. If they could prove themselves not to be reprobates, not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would know that he was not a reprobate, not disowned by Christ. They ought to know if Christ Jesus was in them, by the influences, graces, and indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdom set up in their hearts. Let us question our own souls; either we are true Christians, or we are deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by his Spirit, and power of his love, our faith is dead, and we are yet disapproved by our Judge.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me - see the notes on the previous chapters. They had called in question his apostolic authority; they had demanded the evidence of his divine commission. He says that he would now furnish such evidence by inflicting just punishment on all offenders, and they should have abundant proof that Christ spoke by him, or that he was inspired.<p>Which to you-ward is not weak - Or who, that is, Christ, is not weak, etc. Christ has manifested his power abundantly toward you, that is, either by the miracles that had been performed in his name; or by the diseases and calamities which they had suffered on account of their disorders and offences (see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>); or by the force and efficacy of his doctrine. The connection, it seems to me, requires that we should understand it of the calamities which had been inflicted by Christ on them for their sins, and which Paul says would be inflicted again if they did not repent. The idea is, that they had had ample demonstration of the power of Christ to inflict punishment, and they had reason to apprehend it again. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Since&#8212;The reason why he will not spare: Since ye challenge me to give a "proof" that Christ speaks in me. It would be better if ye would "prove your own selves" (2Co 13:5). This disproves the assertion of some that Scripture nowhere asserts the infallibility of its writers when writing it.<p>which&#8212;"who" (Christ).<p>is not weak&#8212;in relation to you, by me and in this very Epistle, in exercising upon you strong discipline.<p>mighty in you&#8212;has given many proofs of His power in miracles, and even in punishing offenders (2Co 5:11, 20, 21). Ye have no need to put me to the proof in this, as long ago Christ has exhibited great proofs of His power by me among you (2Co 12:12) [Grotius]. It is therefore not me, but Christ, whom ye wrong: it is His patience that ye try in despising my admonitions, and derogating from my authority [Calvin].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ (saith the apostle) hath openly showed his power in my ministry, speaking to you; how else came your hearts to be turned from dumb idols to serve the living God? How came you to be furnished with those excellent gifts wherewith you abound? But, seeing all this is not judged a sufficient proof of Christ’s <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">speaking in me</span> to you, but you are yet doubting whether I am an apostle or no, and calling for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a proof of Christ in me; </span> I will, if I come, and find any that have lived scandalously, and are impenitent, show you another proof of that power and authority with which Christ hath trusted me. Which must be understood, either of his miraculous power to inflict some bodily afflictions upon them, or (which is more probable) of his power as an apostle to cut them off from the communion of gospel churches. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me,.... This is the reason why he was determined, that should he come among them, he would not spare them, because they called in question his apostleship, and demanded a proof of it; which, of all men, they had the least reason to do; for they themselves were the seals of his apostleship, and the signs of an apostle had been done among them; they queried whether he was an ambassador of Christ, and was sent by him, and in his name; whether the message he came with was from him, and whether the Gospel he preached was his voice; and particularly whether he had such a power to punish delinquents, as he threatened them with the exercise of; a strange infatuation of the false apostles this, since Christ, who sent him, was with him, and spoke in him, and by him: <p>which to you-ward, says he, <p>is not weak, but is mighty in you; the Gospel of Christ, at the first preaching of it to them by him, was the power of God unto salvation to them; and was attended with divers signs and wonders, and gifts of the Holy Ghost; and besides, they had instances of the power of Christ towards them in an awful way, in punishing sinners; as in the delivery of the incestuous person to Satan, which was done by his Spirit being with them when assembled; and by smiting many of them with sickness, diseases, and infirmities, and with death itself, who had sinned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4</a>. Wherefore, seeing after all these instances of the voice and power of Christ in him, they yet questioned his apostolical authority, and sought proof of it; and especially since this was not so much a tempting of him, as a tempting of Christ in him, he was resolved not to spare them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{1}</span> Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> mighty in you.</span><p>(1) A most sharp reprehension, because, while they despise the apostle's admonitions, they tempt Christ's own patience: and also while they condemn him as wretched and miserable, they lay nothing against him, which is not common to him with Christ.<p>(a) And will be most mighty to be avenged upon you, when need will be.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>.

The delicate shade of meaning here can hardly be rendered into English. Perhaps ‘of a Christ who speaks in me’ would be the nearest approach to it. Our version hardly conveys a sufficient idea of the perpetual indwelling of Christ in His members and of the inspiring influence which He constantly exerted on one so devoted to Him as St Paul. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-20.htm" title="For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.">Matthew 10:20</a>.

The connection of this verse with what precedes and what follows is to be found in the fact that everything St Paul did, whether in the exercise of his Apostolic power, or in any other way, was done to produce in their lives a conformity to that of Christ. Cf. ch. 6.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which to you-ward is not weak</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">Who</span> to you-ward. St Paul continually (see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body....">2 Corinthians 4:10-11</a>, and ch. 11, 12.) identifies himself with Christ, in his weakness as well as his strength. He is going (see next verse) to point to the weakness of Christ as united with his own. But he prefaces this remarkable statement with the observation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-11.htm" title="Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;">1 Corinthians 4:11</a>) that at present the Corinthians knew little of communion with Christ in His weakness, much of His power to change the heart and life.
