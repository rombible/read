The latter interpretation falls in best with the known facts of the case, and is in entire accordance both with his language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.">2Corinthians 12:14</a>, and with his mode of expressing his intentions, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1Corinthians 16:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</span>—There seems no adequate reason for not taking these words in their simple and natural meaning. The rule, quoted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm" title="Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.">Numbers 35:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, was of the nature of an axiom of Jewish, one might almost say of natural, law. And it had received a fresh prominence from our Lord’s reproduction of it in giving directions as for the discipline of the society which He came to found. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a>.) What more natural than that St. Paul should say, “When I come, there will be no more surmises and vague suspicions, but every offence will be dealt with in a vigorous and full inquiry”? There seems something strained, almost fantastic, in the interpretation which, catching at the accidental juxtaposition of “the <span class= "ital">third</span> time” and the “<span class= "ital">three</span> witnesses,” assumes that the Apostle personifies his actual or intended visits, and treats them as the witnesses whose testimony was to be decisive. It is a fatal objection to this view that it turns the judge into a prosecutor, and makes him appeal to his own reiteration of his charges as evidence of their truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you.

For in the Acts of the Apostles no mention is made of his being at Corinth more than once before this second epistle was written. It must be observed, however, that that history by no means contains all the apostle’s transactions: and it is not improbable that, as Macknight supposes, during the eighteen months which passed from St. Paul’s first coming to Corinth, to the insurrection in the proconsulship of Gallio, the apostle left Corinth for a while, and travelled through Laconia, Arcadia, and the other countries of the province of Achaia, where he converted many, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>,) having preached the gospel to them gratis, as at Corinth, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.">2 Corinthians 11:10</a>,) and founded several churches, referred to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>, and called <span class="ital">Achaia, </span>that is, <span class="ital">churches of Achaia. </span>If therefore the apostle made the excursion here supposed, and spent some months in it, his return to Corinth would be his second visit; consequently, the <span class="ital">coming </span>spoken of in this verse was his coming the third time to them. <span class="ital">In the mouth of two or three witnesses </span>— Agreeing in the attestation of any thing; <span class="ital">shall every word be established </span>— I will hold that to be true which shall be so proved.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 Though it is God's gracious method to bear long with sinners, yet he will not bear always; at length he will come, and will not spare those who remain obstinate and impenitent. Christ at his crucifixion, appeared as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and life showed his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifested the power of God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, and experience, as gold is assayed or proved by the touchstone. If they could prove themselves not to be reprobates, not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would know that he was not a reprobate, not disowned by Christ. They ought to know if Christ Jesus was in them, by the influences, graces, and indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdom set up in their hearts. Let us question our own souls; either we are true Christians, or we are deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by his Spirit, and power of his love, our faith is dead, and we are yet disapproved by our Judge.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the third time ... - see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>. For an interesting view of this passage, see Paley's Horae Paulinae on this Epistle, No. 11: It is evident that Paul had been to Corinth but once before this, but he had resolved to go before a second time, but had been disappointed.<p>In the mouth of two or three witnesses ... - This was what the Law of Moses required; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16</a>; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-17.htm">John 8:17</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>. But in regard to its application here, commentators are not agreed. Some suppose that Paul refers to his own epistles which he had sent to them as the two or three witnesses by which his promise to them would be made certain; that he had purposed it and promised it two or three times, and that as this was all that was required by the Law, it would certainly be established. This is the opinion of Bloomfield, Rosenmuller, Grotius, Hammond, Locke, and some others. But, with all the respect due to such great names, it seems to me that this would be trifling and childish in the extreme. Lightfoot supposes that he refers to Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, who would be witnesses to them of his purpose; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-17.htm">1 Corinthians 16:17</a>. But the more probable opinion, it seems to me, is that of Doddridge, Macknight, and others, that he anticipated that there wound be necessity for the administration of discipline there, but that he would feel himself under obligation in administering it to adhere to the reasonable maxim of the Jewish Law. No one should be condemned or punished where there was not at least two or three witnesses to prove the offence. But where there were, discipline would be administered according to the nature of the crime. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 13<p>2Co 13:1-14.

"I will judge not without examination, nor will I abstain from punishing upon due evidence" [Conybeare and Howson]. I will no longer be among you "in all patience" towards offenders (2Co 12:12). The apostle in this case, where ordinary testimony was to be had, does not look for an immediate revelation, nor does he order the culprits to be cast out of the church before his arrival. Others understand the "two or three witnesses" to mean his two or three visits as establishing either (1) the truth of the facts alleged against the offenders, or (2) the reality of his threats. I prefer the first explanation to either of the two latter.<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you.

God ordered, that the testimony of two or three persons should determine all questions in their law; and that should be taken for certain and established, which such a number of persons asserted. The apostle would from hence have them conclude, that he would certainly come, because this was <span class="ital">the third time</span> that he had resolved upon it, and was preparing for it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This is the third time I am coming to you,.... Or "am ready to come to you", as the Alexandrian copy reads, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>. Though he had been as yet but once at Corinth, and is to be reckoned and accounted for, either after this manner; he had been "once" with them when he first preached the Gospel to them, and was the means of their conversion, and laid, the foundation of their church state, of which there is some account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a> he came to them a "second" time, by writing his first epistle, when he desired to be considered by them, as though he was present with them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3</a> and now a "third" time by this second epistle, in which he also speaks as if he was among them, see the following verse; or else in this way, he had been actually in person with them one time, and had been about to come in purpose and preparation a "second" time, but was prevented, and now was just ready a "third" time to set forward in his journey to them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14</a> and so the Syriac version reads it here, "this is the third time that I am ready to come to you", and which our version also favours. The Alexandrian copy and some others, the Complutension edition, the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, read, "behold, this third time", &amp;c. in order to raise and fix their attention to what he was saying, or about to say: <p>in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established; referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a> which he applies much in the same manner Christ does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a> and which it is probable he had in view; signifying hereby, that he proceeded in a judicial way, according to due form of law, and in such a manner as Christ had directed; and that they were to look upon his several comings in the sense now explained, to be as so many witnesses, whereby the several charges exhibited against them were fully attested and confirmed, so that things were now ripe for judgment, and for a final sentence to pass upon them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This is the third time I am coming to you.

According to Lange, <span class="ital">apost. Zeitalt.</span> I. p. 202 f.

Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a>, where, however, the words of the law are used with another turn to the meaning. Paul announces with the words of the law well known to his readers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which he adopts as his own, that he, arrived for this third time, will, without further indulgence, institute a legal hearing of witnesses (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-19.htm" title="Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.">1 Timothy 5:19</a>), and that <span class="ital">on the basis of the affirmation of two and three witnesses every point of complaint will be decided</span>. Not as if he wished to set himself up as disciplinary judge (this power was vested ordinarily in the <span class="ital">church</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not you judge them that are within?...">1 Corinthians 5:12-13</a>, and was, even in extraordinary cases of punishment, not exercised <span class="ital">alone</span> on the part of the apostle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,...">1 Corinthians 5:3-5</a>), but he would set agoing and arrange the summary procedure in the way of discipline, which he had threatened. Nor did the <span class="ital">notoriety</span> of the transgressions render the latter unnecessary, seeing that, on the one hand, they might not <span class="ital">all</span> be notorious, and, on the other, even those that were so needed a definite <span class="ital">form</span> of treatment. Following Chrysostom and Ambrosiaster, Calvin, Estius, and others, including recently Neander, Olshausen, Raebiger, Ewald, Osiander, Maier, have understood the two or three witnesses of <span class="ital">Paul himself</span>, who takes the various occasions of his presence among the Corinthians as testimonies, by which the <span class="ital">truth</span> of the matters is made good,[391] or the <span class="ital">execution</span> of <span class="ital">his threats</span> (Chrysostom, Theophylact, and others, comp. Bleek, Billroth, Ewald, Hofmann) is to be decided (Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῶν τριῶν μου παρουσιῶν πᾶν ῥῆμα ἀπειλητικὸν κατασταθήσεται καθʼ ἱμῶν καὶ κυρωθήσεται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν μὴ μετανοήσατε</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ μαρτύρων γὰρ τὰς παρουσίας αὐτοῦ τίθησι</span>). But if Paul regarded himself, under the point of view of his different visits to Corinth respectively, as the witnesses, he could make himself pass for <span class="ital">three</span> witnesses only in respect of those evils which he had already perceived at his <span class="ital">first</span> visit (and then again on his <span class="ital">second</span> and <span class="ital">third</span>), and for <span class="ital">two</span> witnesses only in respect of those evils which he had lighted upon in his <span class="ital">second</span> visit for the <span class="ital">first</span> time, and would on his <span class="ital">third</span> visit encounter a <span class="ital">second</span> time. But in this view precisely all those evils and sins would be left out of account, which had <span class="ital">only</span> come into prominence <span class="ital">after his second visit</span>; for as regards these, because he was only to become acquainted with them for the <span class="ital">first</span> time at his <span class="ital">third</span> visit, he would only pass as <span class="ital">one</span> witness. Consequently this explanation, Pauline though it looks, is inappropriate; nor is the difficulty got over by the admission that the relations in question are not to be dealt with too exactly (Osiander), as, indeed, the objection, that the threat is directed against the <span class="greekheb">προημαρτηκότες</span>, avails nothing on the correct view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>, and the continued validity of the legal ordinance itself (it holds, in fact, even at the present day in the common law) should not after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1 Timothy 5:10</a> have been doubted. Nor does the refining of Hofmann dispose of the matter. He thinks, forsooth, that besides the <span class="greekheb">προημαρτηκότες</span>, all the rest also, whom such a threat may concern, are now <span class="ital">twice</span> warned, <span class="ital">orally</span> (at the second visit of the apostle) and <span class="ital">in writing</span> (by this letter), and his <span class="ital">arrival</span> will be to them the <span class="ital">third</span> and <span class="ital">last</span> admonition to reflect. This is not appropriate either to the words (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:">2 Corinthians 13:2</a>) or to the necessary unity and equality of the idea of <span class="ital">witnesses</span>, with which, in fact, Paul—and, moreover, in application of so solemn a passage of the law—would have dealt very oddly, if not only <span class="ital">he himself</span> was to represent the three witnesses, but one of them was even to be his <span class="ital">letter</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καί</span>] not in the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span>, as, following the Vulgate, many earlier and modern expositors (including Flatt and Emmerling) would take it, but: <span class="ital">and</span>, if, namely, there are so many.[392] Paul might have put <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a>, but, following the LXX., he has thought on <span class="ital">and</span>, and therefore <span class="ital">put</span> i.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πᾶν ῥῆμα</span>] everything that comes to be spoken of, to be discussed. Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-4.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.">Matthew 4:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σταθήσεται</span>] <span class="ital">will be established</span> (<span class="greekheb">יַקוּם</span>), namely, for judicial decision. This is more in keeping with the original text than (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-25.htm" title="Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said to him, You have said.">Matthew 26:25</a>): will be <span class="ital">weighed</span> (Ewald).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[390] Most of them, like Grotius, Estius, Wolf, Wetstein, Zachariae, Flatt, were of opinion that Paul expresses here, too, simply a third <span class="ital">readiness</span> to come, from which view also has arisen the reading <span class="greekheb">ἑτοίμως ἔχω ἐλθεῖν</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ἔρχομαι</span> in A, Syr. Erp. Copt. To this also Baur reverts, who explains <span class="greekheb">ἔρχομαι</span>: <span class="ital">I am on the point</span> of coming. But this would, in fact, be just a third <span class="ital">actual</span> coming, which Paul was <span class="ital">on the point of</span>, and would presuppose his <span class="ital">having come</span> already twice. Beza and others suggest: “<span class="ital">Binas suas epistolas</span> (!) pro totidem ad illos profectionibus recenset.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[391] Grotius, in consistency with the view that Paul had been only <span class="ital">once</span> there, quite at variance with the words of the passage pares down the meaning to this: “cum bis terve id dixerim, tandem ratum erit.” Compare also Clericus. The explanation of Emmerling: “Titum ejusque comites certissimum edituros esse testimonium de animo suo Corinthios invisendi,” is purely fanciful. The simple and correct view is given already by Erasmus in his <span class="ital">Paraphr.:</span> “<span class="ital">Hic erit tertius meus ad vos adventus; in hunc se quisque praeparet. Neque enim amplius connivebo, sed juxta jus strictum atque exactum res agetur. Quisquis delatus fuerit, is duorum aut trium hominum testimonio vel absolvetur vel damnabitur</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[392] It corresponds quite to the German expression “zwei <span class="ital">bis</span> drei.” Comp.

(comp.
