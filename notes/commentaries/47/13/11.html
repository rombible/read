Taking the verb and the noun together, the word occurs twenty-eight times in it.<p><span class= "bld">Be of one mind.</span>—The phrase was one specially characteristic of St. Paul’s teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm" title="That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm" title="Fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.">Philippians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.">Philippians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2</a>). His thoughts are apparently travelling back to the schisms over which he had grieved in 1 Corinthians 1-3, and to which he had referred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2Corinthians 12:20</a>. What he seeks is the restoration of unity of purpose, and with that of inward and outward peace. If these conditions were fulfilled, the “God of love and peace would assuredly be with them,” for peace rests ever upon the son of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-6.htm" title="And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on it: if not, it shall turn to you again.">Luke 10:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell.

It is with great reason that this comprehensive and instructive blessing is pronounced at the close of our solemn assemblies. And it is a very indecent thing to see so many quitting them, and getting into postures of remove, before this short sentence can be ended. How often have we heard this awful benediction pronounced! Let us study it more and more, that we may value it proportionably; that we may either deliver or receive it with becoming reverence, with eyes and hearts lifted up to God, <span class="ital">who giveth the blessing out of Sion, and life for evermore.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:11-14 Here are several good exhortations.

And let it be our constant aim so to walk, that separation from our friends may be only for a time, and that we may meet in that happy world where parting will be unknown. He wishes that they may partake all the benefits which Christ of his free grace and favour has purchased; the Father out of his free love has purposed; and the Holy Ghost applies and bestows.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Finally, brethren - (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  loipon). The remainder; all that remains is for me to bid you an affectionate farewell. The word here rendered "farewell" (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  chairete), means usually to joy and rejoice, or to be glad; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-14.htm">Luke 1:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>; and it is often used in the sense of "joy to you," "hail!" as a salutation; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>. It is also used as a salutation at the beginning of an epistle, in the sense of greeting; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-26.htm">Acts 23:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>. It is generally agreed, however, that it is here to be understood in the sense of farewell, as a parting salutation, though it may be admitted that there is included in the word an expression of a wish for their happiness. This was among the last words which Cyrus, when dying, addressed to his friends.<p>Be perfect - See this word explained in the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm">2 Corinthians 13:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>. It was a wish that every disorder might be removed; that all that was out of joint might be restored; that everything might be in its proper place; and that they might be just what they ought to be: A command to be perfect, however, does not prove that it has ever in fact been obeyed: and an earnest wish on the part of an apostle that others might be perfect, does not demonstrate that they were; and this passage should not be adduced to prove that any have been free from sin. It may be adduced, however, to prove that an obligation rests on Christians to be perfect, and that there is no natural obstacle to their becoming such, since God never can command us to do an impossibility. Whether anyone, but the Lord Jesus, has been perfect, however, is a question on which different denominations of Christians have been greatly divided. It is incumbent on the advocates of the doctrine of sinless perfection to produce some one instance of a perfectly sinless character. This has not yet been done.<p>Be of good comfort - Be consoled by the promises and supports of the gospel. Take comfort from the hopes which the gospel imparts. Or the word may possibly have a reciprocal sense, and mean, comfort one another; see Schleusner. Rosenmuller renders it, "receive admonition from all with a grateful mind, that you may come to greater perfection." It is, at any rate, the expression of an earnest wish on the part of the apostle, that they might be happy.<p>Be of one mind - They had been greatly distracted, and divided into different parties and factions. At the close of the Epistle he exhorts them as he had repeatedly done before, to lay aside these strifes, and to be united, and manifest the same spirit; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>, note; see the note also on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>, note. The sense is, that Paul desired that dissensions should cease, and that they should be united in opinion and feeling as Christian brethren.<p>Live in peace - With each other. Let contentions and strifes cease. To promote the restoration of peace had been the main design of these epistles.<p>And the God of love and peace - The God who is all love, and who is the Author of all peace. What a glorious appellation is this! There can be no more beautiful expression, and it is as true as it is beautiful, that God is a God of love and of peace. He is infinitely benevolent; He delights in exhibiting His love; and He delights in the love which His people evince for each other. At the same time, He is the Author of peace, and He delights in peace among people. When Christians love each other they have reason to expect that the God of love will be with them; when they live in peace, they may expect the God of peace will take up His abode with them. In contention and strife we have no reason to expect His presence; and it is only when we are willing to lay aside all animosity that we may expect the God of peace will fix his abode with us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. farewell&#8212;meaning in Greek also "rejoice"; thus in bidding farewell he returns to the point with which he set out, "we are helpers of your joy" (2Co 1:24; Php 4:4).<p>Be perfect&#8212;Become perfect by filling up what is lacking in your Christian character (Eph 4:13).<p>be of good comfort&#8212;(2Co 1:6; 7:8-13; 1Th 4:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Finally, brethren, farewell:</span> the apostle shutteth up his Epistle according to the ordinary form of conclusions of letters, wishing all happiness to them: but he addeth something as a Christian, and a minister of the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Be perfect:</span> the word katartizesye signifies to be compact, or united, as members of the same body, or parts of the same house; the perfection of a society lying much in the union of it. The perfection the apostle presseth here, seemeth to be the perfection of the body of the church, by the restoring of such as were separated from its communion, or had, through a spirit of contention, withdrawn themselves, rather than the perfection of the particular members of it, in the habits and exercises of grace. The Greek word seemeth that way to carry the sense; it properly signifies, the putting of members loosed from their joints into their proper place again, and such a perfection as followeth upon such an action, or any action proportionable to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Be of good comfort; </span> the word imports exhorted, comforted, confirmed: be exhorted to yield obedience to my precepts, or counsels; be comforted in all the trials or afflictions you do meet with, or may further meet with, for your profession of the gospel; be confirmed in the truths and holy ways of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Be of one mind; </span> if possible, of one and the same judgment in the truths of God; however, as pursuing the same scope and end; be one in affection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Live in peace, </span> free from those contentions and divisions, those debates, and strifes, and wraths, and envyings, which I have before told you of as faults among you.

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-4.htm" title="Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.">Php 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm" title="Rejoice ever more.">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>. <span class="ital">Joy</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>) was one of the foremost fruits of the Spirit, and ought to be the natural result of the sense of our favour with God through Christ See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-11.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.">John 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-52.htm" title="And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 13:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm" title="Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.">Hebrews 13:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-2.htm" title="My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;">James 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-8.htm" title="Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:">1 Peter 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1 Peter 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-4.htm" title="And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full.">1 John 1:4</a>, &c.

Our translation here follows Tyndale. Wiclif, following the Vulgate, renders <span class="ital">excite ye</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be of one mind</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>, and observe the close connection of ideas there between unity of spirit and the word translated <span class="ital">be perfect</span> above. The literal rendering is <span class="bld">think the same thing</span>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm" title="Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.">Romans 12:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the God of love</span>] It would have been impossible even in the 16th century to render here ‘the God of <span class="ital">charity</span>.’ The Vulgate here has <span class="ital">dilectionis</span>, not <span class="ital">caritatis. Caritas</span> and <span class="ital">charity</span> seem to have been used for the human reflection of God’s love, to the grievous obscuration of the great Christian fact that all love is His love, whether manifested <span class="ital">by</span> Him or <span class="ital">in</span> man. It may be asked whether in order to think the same thing and be at peace, we do not first need the God of love and peace to be with us. Undoubtedly, but if we do not follow His promptings while with us, we drive Him away. Therefore if we wish Him to abide continually with us, we must walk according to the Spirit which He hath given us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell.

Paul had written somewhat severely in discussing this matter; now more gently, without however dismissing the subject itself; comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>.—<span class="greekheb">χαίρετε</span>) <span class="ital">rejoice</span>.

The word may also moan "rejoice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Be perfect</span> (see note on "perfection" in ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">Be of one mind;</span> literally, <span class="accented">think the same thing</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16, 18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Be at peace</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Finally (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., as for the rest. Sometimes rendered now, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>. "Sleep on now," for the time that remains. Besides, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-16.htm">1 Corinthians 1:16</a>. It remaineth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>.

In every case the idea of something left over is at the bottom of the translation.<p>Farewell (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>In the classics used both at meeting and at parting. Lit., hail! See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>. Rev., in margin, has rejoice. It is somewhat doubtful whether it ever has the meaning farewell in the New Testament. Edersheim says that, on Sabbaths, when the outgoing course of priests left the temple, they parted from each other with a farewell, reminding us of this to the Corinthians: "He that has caused His name to dwell in this house cause love, brotherhood, peace, and friendship to dwell among you" ("The Temple," p. 117).<p>Be perfect (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>Rev., be perfected. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-40.htm">Luke 6:40</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>. Paul speaks both of individual perfection and of the perfection of the Church through the right adjustment of all its members in Christ. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>. The verb is kindred with perfecting, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm">2 Corinthians 13:9</a>. </body></html>
