In doing so, he repeats what he had said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-20.htm" title="All the brothers greet you. Greet you one another with an holy kiss.">1Corinthians 16:20</a>. The same injunction appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-16.htm" title="Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.">Romans 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm" title="Greet all the brothers with an holy kiss.">1Thessalonians 5:26</a>. What he meant was that, as the public reading of the Epistle came to a close, the men who listened should embrace each other and kiss each other’s cheeks, in token that all offences were forgotten and forgiven, and that there was nothing but peace and goodwill between them. It was, perhaps, natural, that the counsel should be taken as a rubric, even at the cost of its losing its real significance, and becoming a stereotyped formula. So in the Apostolic Constitutions (possibly of the third century) we find the rubric, “Let the deacons say to all, ‘Salute ye one another with a holy kiss:’ and let the clergy salute the bishop, the men of the laity salute the men, the women the women.” The deacons were to watch that there was no disorder during the act (8:57). In the account given by Justin (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> i. 65) it appears as preceding the oblation of the bread and wine for the Eucharistic Feast, as it did in most of the Eastern liturgies, probably as a symbolic act of obedience to the command of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-24.htm" title="Leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.">Matthew 5:24</a>. In the Western Church it came after the consecration of the elements and the Lord’s Prayer. It was intermitted on Good Friday in the African Church (Tertull. <span class= "ital">De Orat.</span> c. 14) as unsuitable for a day of mourning. It may be noted as the survival of a residuum of the old practice, that when the usage was suppressed by the Western Church, in the thirteenth century, it was replaced by the act of kissing a marble or ivory tablet, on which some sacred subject, such as the Crucifixion, had been carved, which was passed from one to another, and was known as the <span class= "ital">osculatorium,</span> or “kissing instrument.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:11-14 Here are several good exhortations. God is the Author of peace and Lover of concord; he hath loved us, and is willing to be at peace with us. And let it be our constant aim so to walk, that separation from our friends may be only for a time, and that we may meet in that happy world where parting will be unknown. He wishes that they may partake all the benefits which Christ of his free grace and favour has purchased; the Father out of his free love has purposed; and the Holy Ghost applies and bestows.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Greet - Salute; see the note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>.<p>With an holy kiss - note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. farewell&#8212;meaning in Greek also "rejoice"; thus in bidding farewell he returns to the point with which he set out, "we are helpers of your joy" (2Co 1:24; Php 4:4).<p>Be perfect&#8212;Become perfect by filling up what is lacking in your Christian character (Eph 4:13).<p>be of good comfort&#8212;(2Co 1:6; 7:8-13; 1Th 4:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-16.htm" title="Salute one another with an holy kiss.

It was an ancient custom and of common use, when friends met, for them (as a token of mutual love and friendship) to kiss each other: the Christians used it also at their ecclesiastical assemblings. It must not be looked upon as a precept, obliging all Christians to do the like; but only as directing those that then did use it, to use it innocently, chastely, sincerely, and holily. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Greet one another with an holy kiss.

The practice was maintained chiefly at the celebration of the Eucharist. In the "Apostolic Constitutions" it is enjoined that, before the communion, the clergy kiss the bishop, the laymen amongst each other, and so the women. This latter injunction grew out of the reproach of looseness of manners circulated by the heathen against the Christians. On Good Friday it was omitted in commemoration of Judas' kiss. In the West the practice survives among the Glassites or Sandemanians. In the Latin Church, after the end of the thirteenth century, there was substituted for it a piece of the altar furniture called a Pax (peace), which was given to the deacon with the words Peace to thee and to the Church. In the East it is continued in the Coptic and Russian Churches. </body></html>
