Christ at his crucifixion, appeared as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and life showed his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifested the power of God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, and experience, as gold is assayed or proved by the touchstone. If they could prove themselves not to be reprobates, not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would know that he was not a reprobate, not disowned by Christ. They ought to know if Christ Jesus was in them, by the influences, graces, and indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdom set up in their hearts. Let us question our own souls; either we are true Christians, or we are deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by his Spirit, and power of his love, our faith is dead, and we are yet disapproved by our Judge.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Examine yourselves - see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>. The particular reason why Paul calls on them to examine themselves was, that there was occasion to fear that many of them had been deceived. Such had been the irregularities and disorders in the church at Corinth; so ignorant had many of them shown themselves of the nature of the Christian religion, that it was important, in the highest degree, for them to institute a strict and impartial examination to ascertain whether they had not been altogether deceived. This examination, however, is never unimportant or useless for Christians; and an exhortation to do it is always in place. So important are the interests at stake, and so liable are the best to deceive themselves, that all Christians should be often induced to examine the foundation of their hope of eternal salvation.<p>Whether ye be in the faith - Whether you are true Christians. Whether you have any true faith in the gospel. Faith in Jesus Christ, and in the promises of God through him, is one of the distinguishing characteristics of a true Christian; and to ascertain whether we have any true faith, therefore, is to ascertain whether we are sincere Christians. For some reasons for such an examination, and some remarks on the mode of doing it; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>.<p>Prove your own selves - The word used here (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  dokimazete) is stronger than that before used, and rendered "examine" (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  peirazete). This word, prove, refers to assaying or trying metals by the powerful action of heat; and the idea here is, that they should make the most thorough trial of their religion, to see whether it would stand the test; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>. The proof of their piety was to be arrived at by a faithful examination of their own hearts and lives; by a diligent comparison of their views and feelings with the word of God; and especially by making trial of it in life. The best way to prove our piety is to subject it to actual trial in the various duties and responsibilites of life. A man who wishes to prove an axe to see whether it is good or not, does not sit down and look at it, or read all the treatises which he can find on axe-making, and on the properties of iron and steel, valuable as such information would be; but he shoulders his axe and goes into the woods, and puts it to the trial there.<p>If it cuts well; if it does not break; if it is not soon made dull, he understands the quality of his axe better than he could in any other way. So if a man wishes to know what his religion is worth, let him try it in the places where religion is of any value. Let him go into the world with it. Let him go and try to do good; to endure affliction in a proper manner; to combat the errors and follies of life; to admonish sinners of the error of their ways; and to urge forward the great work of the conversion of the world, and he will soon see there what his religion is worth - as easily as a man can test the qualities of an axe. Let him not merely sit down and think, and compare himself with the Bible and look at his own heart - valuable as this may be in many respects - but let him treat his religion as he would anything else - let him subject it to actual experiment. That religion which will enable a man to imitate the example of Paul or Howard, or the great Master himself, in doing good, is genuine.<p>That religion which will enable a man to endure persecution for the name of Jesus; to bear calamity without complaining; to submit to a long series of disappointments and distresses for Christ's sake, is genuine. That religion which will prompt a man unceasingly to a life of prayer and self-denial; which will make him ever conscientious, industrious, and honest; which will enable him to warn sinners of the errors of their ways, and which will dispose him to seek the friendship of Christians, and the salvation of the world, is pure and genuine. That will answer the purpose. It is like the good axe with which a man can chop all day long, in which there is no flaw, and which does not get dull, and which answers all the purposes of an axe. Any other religion than this is worthless.<p>Know ye not your own selves - That is, "Do you not know yourselves?" This does not mean, as some may suppose, that they might know of themselves, without the aid of others, what their character was; or that they might themselves ascertain it; but it means that they might know themselves, that is, their character, principles, conduct. This proves that Christians may know their true character. If they are Christians, they may know it with as undoubted certainty as they may know their character on any other subject. Why should not a man be as able to determine whether he loves God as whether he loves a child, a parent, or a friend? What greater difficulty need there be in understanding the character on the subject of religion than on any other subject; and why should there be anymore reason for doubt on this than on any other point of character? And yet it is remarkable, that while a child has no doubt that he loves a parent, or a husband a wife, or a friend a friend, almost all Christians are in very great doubt about their attachment to the Redeemer and to the great principles of religion.<p>Such was not the case with the apostles and early Christians. "I know," says Paul," whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him," etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>. "We know.' says John, speaking in the name of the body of Christians, "that we have passed from death unto life;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>. "We know that we are of the truth;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-19.htm">1 John 3:19</a>. "We know that he abideth in us;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>. "We know that we dwell in him;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-13.htm">1 John 4:13</a>; see also <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-2.htm">John 5:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-20</a>. So Job said, "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand in the latter day upon the earth," etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>. Such is the current language of scripture. Where, in the Bible, do the sacred speakers and writers express doubts about their attachment to God and the Redeemer? Where is such language to be found as we hear from almost all professing Christians, expressing entire uncertainty about their condition; absolute doubt whether they love God or hate him; whether they are going to heaven or hell; whether they are influenced by good motives or bad; and even making it a matter of merit to be in such doubt, and thinking it wrong not to doubt?<p>What would be thought of a husband that should make it a matter of merit to doubt whether he loved his wife; or of a child that should think it wrong not to doubt whether he loved his father or mother? Such attachments ought to be doubted - but they do not occur in the common relations of life. On the subject of religion, people often act as they do on no other subject; and if it is right for one to be satisfied of the sincerity of his attachments to his best earthly friends, and to speak of such attachment without wavering or misgiving, it cannot be wrong to be satisfied with regard to our attachment to God, and to speak of that attachment, as the apostles did, in language of undoubted confidence.<p>How that Jesus Christ is in you - To be in Christ, or for Christ to be in us, is a common mode in the Scriptures of expressing the idea that we are Christians. It is language derived from the close union which subsists between the Redeemer and his people: see the phrase explained in the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>.<p>Except ye be reprobates - see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>. The word rendered "reprobates" (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  adokimoi) means properly not approved, rejected: that which will not stand the trial. It is properly applicable to metals, as denoting that they will not bear the tests to which they are subjected, but are found to be base or adulterated. The sense here is, that they might know that they were Christians, unless their religion was base, false, adulterated; or such as would not bear the test. There is no allusion here to the sense which is sometimes given to the word "reprobate," of being cast off or abandoned by God, or doomed by him to eternal ruin in accordance with an eternal purpose. Whatever may be the truth on that subject, nothing is taught in regard to it here. The simple idea is, that they might know that they were Christians, unless their religion was such as would not stand the test, or was worthless. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Examine&#8212;Greek, "Try (make trial of) yourselves."<p>prove your own selves&#8212;This should be your first aim, rather than "seeking a proof of Christ speaking in me" (2Co 13:3).<p>your own selves&#8212;I need not speak much in proof of Christ being in me, your minister (2Co 13:3), for if ye try your own selves ye will see that Christ is also in you [Chrysostom], (Ro 8:10).

To doubt it would be the sin of Israel, who, after so many miracles and experimental proofs of God's presence, still cried (Ex 17:7), "Is the Lord among us or not?" (Compare Mr 8:11).<p>except ye be reprobates&#8212;The Greek softens the expression, "somewhat reprobates," that is, not abiding the "proof" (alluding to the same word in the context); failing when tested.

For he knew that they were baptized, and Christians in outward profession; nor is he blaming them for any apostacy from the doctrine of faith, only for an ill life, which evidenceth their faith not to be the <span class="ital">faith of God’s elect, </span> a faith of the <span class="ital">operation of God, </span>& c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Prove your own selves:</span> he doubleth the exhortation upon them, possibly for this end, to let them know, that if they found themselves in the faith, they could not reasonably doubt whether he himself was in the faith, or not, whom God had made the instrument to convert them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Know ye not your own selves:</span> he commends to them the knowledge of themselves, as being a far more desirable piece of knowledge than the knowledge of other men; as to what they are, or what their state is towards God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">How that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</span> In the inquiry after this, he bids them to inquire, whether Christ was in them, yea or no? The name of Christ was named upon them in their baptism, Christ had been preached to them; this the apostle knew; but all this might be, and yet Christ not dwell in their hearts by faith. This is the great point the apostle directs them to examine and prove themselves about, whether Christ was in them by a lively faith? Apprehended and applied as their Saviour, ruling and governing them as their Lord and King? He lets them know the importance of this inquiry, telling them that Jesus Christ must be in them, if they were not <span class="ital">reprobates.</span> But (some might say) how could the apostle conclude this? Though at present Christ was not in them, and they as yet were no more than formal professors, yet might not God open their eyes, and work in them afterwards a more full and effectual change? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The apostle might be allowed to know more than ordinary ministers can know. He had before said: <span class="ital">If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. When the gospel and the means of grace have been for some considerable time in a place, it is much to be feared, that those who have not in that time felt the saving power and effect of it upon their hearts, never shall. It is ordinarily observed, that where God blesseth the ministry of any to convert souls, their greatest harvest is in the first years of their ministry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Some think, that the word adokimoi should not be translated <span class="ital">reprobates, </span> but rather, not approved by God. If Christ be not in the soul by faith, it cannot be approved of God, because <span class="ital">without faith it is impossible to please God.</span> But we generally translate the word by <span class="ital">reprobate, rejected, castaway, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1 Corinthians 9:27</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.">2 Timothy 3:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm" title="They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.">Titus 1:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm" title="But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is near to cursing; whose end is to be burned.">Hebrews 6:8</a></span>. It seemeth to signify persons given over by God to a stupidity of mind, &c. So as the apostle here useth a very close argument, to put them upon a search into their own hearts and states, to see if they could find Christ dwelling in them; for otherwise, (considering their long profession, and the revelation of Christ to them), it would be a ground of fear, that they were such as God had cast off for ever. However, as to their present state, they had no ground to conclude better, whatever mercy God might afterwards show them. Men’s sitting and continuing long under the means of grace, and an outward profession, without a saving knowledge of Christ, and true savour of the truth, and a reformation of their lives according to the rules and directions of the gospel, is not indeed an infallible sign that he who formed them will never show them any favour; but it is a very great presumption that it will be so with such. Which should therefore strongly engage them to be very often and very seriously proving themselves, as to this thing, whether they be in Christ, and whether they have a true, saving faith? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith,.... These words are to be considered in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3</a> for seeing they sought and demanded a proof the voice and power of Christ in the apostle, he directs them to self examination, to look within themselves, to try, prove, and recognise their own souls; where if things were right, they would find a proof of Christ's speaking in him, to them: he advises them to examine the state of their own souls, and see whether they were in the faith; either in the doctrine of faith, having a spiritual and experimental knowledge of it, true love and affection for it, an hearty belief of it, having felt the power of it upon their souls, and abode in it; whether, as the Syriac version reads it, , "ye stand in the faith", firm and stable; or in the grace of faith, either of miracles, or that which is connected with salvation; and which if they were in it, and had it, is attended with good works; operates by love to Christ and to his people; by which souls go out of themselves to Christ, live upon him, receive from him, and give him all the glory of salvation: and if this was their case, he desires to know how they came by their faith; and suggests, that their light in the doctrine of the Gospel, and their faith in Christ Jesus, as well as the miraculous gifts many of them were possessed of, were through his ministry as the means; and this was a full proof of Christ's speaking in him: <p>prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you; by which he means, that if they took a survey of things in their own souls, it would appear that Christ was in them; not as he is in all the world, filling heaven and earth with his presence; or as he is in every rational creature, as the Creator and author of the light of nature; but in a special and spiritual manner, by his Spirit and grace; the Father reveals him in his people, as the foundation of their hope of glory; he himself enters and takes possession of their hearts in conversion, communicates his grace, and manifests himself, and is formed there by his Spirit; his graces are implanted, his image is stamped, his Spirit is put within them, and he himself dwells by faith: and this upon inquiry would be found to be the case of the Corinthians, <p>except, says the apostle, <p>ye are reprobates; meaning not that they were so, as such may stand opposed to the elect of God; for persons may as yet neither be in the faith, nor Christ in them, and yet both be hereafter, and so not be left of God, or consigned to destruction; but that if they were not in the doctrine of, faith, then they were reprobate concerning it, or void of judgment in it; and if they had not the grace of faith, and Christ was not in them, then they were not genuine, but nominal professors, like "reprobate silver", counterfeit coin; which when detected, would be "disapproved", not only by God, but man, as this word also signifies, and so stands opposed to them that are "approved", <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-7.htm">2 Corinthians 13:7</a> or if they did not make such an examination, probation, and recognition of themselves, they would be without probation: or as the Arabic version, without experiment. The apostle hereby brings them into this dilemma, either that if upon examination they were found to be in the faith, and Christ in them, which blessings they enjoyed through his ministry, then they did not want a proof of Christ speaking in him; but if these things did not appear in them, then they were persons of no judgment in spiritual things, were not real Christians, but insignificant and useless persons. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.

Instead of wishing to put to the proof <span class="ital">Christ</span> (in Paul), they should try <span class="ital">themselves</span> (<span class="greekheb">πειράζειν</span>, to put to the test, and that by comparison of their Christian <span class="ital">state</span> with what they <span class="ital">ought</span> to be), prove <span class="ital">themselves</span> (<span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζειν</span>). Oecumenius and Theophylact correctly estimate the force of the twice emphatically prefixed <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτούς</span>; <span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζειν</span>, however, is not, any more than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-8.htm" title="For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.">1 Corinthians 11:8</a>, equivalent to <span class="greekheb">δόκιμον ποιεῖν</span> (Rückert); but what Paul had previously said by <span class="greekheb">πειράζετε</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ ἐστὲ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>., he once more sums up, and that with a glance back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>, emphatically by the <span class="ital">one</span> word <span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζετε</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰ ἐστὲ ἐν τῇ πίστει</span>] dependent on <span class="greekheb">πειράζετε</span>, not on <span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζετε</span>: whether ye are <span class="ital">in the faith</span>, whether ye find yourselves in the <span class="ital">fides salvifica</span> (not to be taken of faith in miracles, as Chrysostom would have it), which is the fundamental condition of all Christian character and life.

The words <span class="ital">yourselves</span> are in each case emphatic. The connection with what has gone before would seem to be as follows. The Apostle had been among the Corinthians in weakness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>; cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>). He had boasted of nothing but his infirmity (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.">2 Corinthians 11:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-5.htm" title="Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities.">2 Corinthians 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). So that many of them had come to regard him with contempt. But the Gospel, he says, is a power. He appeals to the testimony of their own Christian experience on the point, as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-4.htm" title="But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,">2 Corinthians 6:4</a>. ‘Is it <span class="ital">not</span> a power?’ he says. ‘Look at yourselves.

Does not Jesus Christ dwell in you, at least in all who are not finally cast off by Him, and does He not make manifest His power in the subjugation of the natural man within you?

We find the same truth frequently in St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Except ye be reprobates.</span> The Greek word <span class="accented">adokimoi</span> - from the same root as the verb "to test" - means tried and found to be worthless. "<span class="accented">Reprobate</span> silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-30.htm">Jeremiah 6:30</a>). The word is found almost exclusively in St Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>). The only other passage of  the New Testament where it occurs is <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>; and the reader must not read Calvinistic horrors into an expression which gives no sanction to them. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Examine yourselves (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Yourselves is emphatic. Instead of putting Christ to the test, test yourselves. Rev., try, is better than examine. Examination does not necessarily imply a practical test. It may be merely from curiosity.

A reprobate is one abandoned to perdition. The word is kindred to the verb prove (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;), and means disapproved on trial.
