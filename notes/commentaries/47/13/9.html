We may think of the weakness of his bodily presence, of his physical infirmities, of the apparent failure of his supernatural powers because the condition of the Corinthian Church, as walking in faith and truth, presented no opening for their exercise. He can find cause for joy in all these, if only the disciples whom he loves are strong with the strength of God.<span class= "bld"><p>This also we wish, even your perfection.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">your restoration.</span> This is the only passage in the New Testament in which the word occurs; but the corresponding verb is found in the <span class= "ital">“mending</span> their nets” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm" title="And when he had gone a little farther there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.">Mark 1:19</a>, and in the “restore” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>. Its proper meaning is to bring back to completeness. This, then, was what the Apostle had been aiming at all along. In his seeming harshness and self-assertion, as in his overflowing tenderness, he was looking forward to their restoration to their first love and their first purity. He would rather threaten than act, even at the cost of the threat appearing an empty vaunt, if only he might be spared the necessity for acting.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:7-10 The most desirable thing we can ask of God, for ourselves and our friends, is to be kept from sin, that we and they may not do evil. We have far more need to pray that we may not do evil, than that we may not suffer evil. The apostle not only desired that they might be kept from sin, but also that they might grow in grace, and increase in holiness. We are earnestly to pray to God for those we caution, that they may cease to do evil, and learn to do well; and we should be glad for others to be strong in the grace of Christ, though it may be the means of showing our own weakness. let us also pray that we may be enabled to make a proper use of all our talents.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we are glad when we are weak ... - We rejoice in your welfare, and are willing to submit to self-denial and to infirmity if it may promote your spiritual strength. In the connection in which this stands it seems to mean, "I am content to appear weak, provided you do no wrong; I am willing not to have occasion to exercise my power in punishing offenders, and had rather lie under the reproach of being actually weak, than to have occasion to exercise my power by punishing you for wrongdoing; and provided you are strong in the faith and in the hope of the gospel, I am very willing, nay, I rejoice that I am under this necessity of appearing weak."<p>And this also we wish - I desire this in addition to your doing no evil.<p>Even your perfection - The word used here (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  katartisis) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, though the verb from which it is derived (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  katartizo&#772;) occurs often; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm">Matthew 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-16.htm">Matthew 21:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-40.htm">Luke 6:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>, et al.; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>. On the meaning of the word see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>. The idea of restoring, putting in order, fitting, repairing, is involved in the word "always," and hence, the idea of making perfect; that is, of completely restoring anything to its proper place. Here it evidently means that Paul wished their entire reformation - so that there should be no occasion for exercising discipline. Doddridge renders it, "perfect good order." Macknight, "restoration." For this restoration of good order Paul had diligently labored in these epistles; and this was an object near to his heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. are glad&#8212;Greek, "rejoice."<p>when we are weak&#8212;having no occasion for displaying our power; and so seeming "weak," as being compassed with "infirmities" (2Co 10:10; 11:29, 30).<p>ye &#8230; strong&#8212;"mighty" in faith and the fruits of the Spirit.<p>and&#8212;not in the oldest manuscripts.<p>we wish&#8212;Greek, "pray for."<p>your perfection&#8212;literally, "perfect restoration"; literally, that of a dislocated limb.

These make the sense to be this; I am so far from coming with a desire to show amongst you my apostolical power in punishing offenders, as that I should be glad to find you so strong in the exercise of grace, that I should find none to punish; that men be made weak (as to the putting forth that power) by your spiritual strength. I incline to a more general interpretation. The apostle by this purgeth himself from any thing of vain glory, or seeking himself; Though (saith he) I be weak, (as some amongst you report me), yet if you be truly strong, I shall heartily rejoice therein.

At present none of the burdens, but many of the blessings of the Gospel, have fallen on the Corinthians. St Paul rejoices that their immature faith is not subjected to the severe strain of persecution and affliction, while as respects himself, he rejoices in sorrows (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>), regarding them as proofs of the ascendency of the life of the Spirit over that of the flesh.

The word translated <span class="ital">am glad</span> is somewhat stronger in the original—<span class="ital">rejoice</span>.

It refers to the inner strength of spirit with which the believer in Christ is endued.
