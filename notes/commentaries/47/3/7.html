We can almost picture him to ourselves as taking up his LXX. version of the Law, and reproducing its very words and thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">So that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold . . .</span>—The narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.">Exodus 34:29-35</a> records that when Moses came down from the mount with the second tables of stone, “the skin of his face shone,” and the “people were afraid to draw nigh unto him.” The English version—that “<span class= "ital">till</span> Moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his face,” and that “when he went in before the Lord he took it off until he came out”—suggests the thought that he appeared to the people, after the first manifestation of the unconscious glory, as a veiled prophet. It is doubtful, however, whether this is the natural meaning of the Hebrew, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-35.htm" title="And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.">Exodus 34:35</a> repeats the statement that the Israelites saw the glory. The LXX., Vulgate, and most modern versions give, “When he ceased speaking he put a veil on his face.” They saw the brightness, they shrank from it in awe, they were not allowed to watch it to the end and gaze on its disappearance. This was the sequence of facts that St. Paul had in his thoughts, and which he certainly found in the LXX.; and it is of this, accordingly, that he speaks. The children of Israel could not bear to look on the glory, even though it was perishing and evanescent. The English rendering, “which glory was to be done away,” reads into the participle a gerundial force that does not properly belong to it; and it may be noted that it is the first of the great English versions that does so, the others giving, “which is made void,” or “which is done away.” It would be better expressed, perhaps, by, <span class= "ital">which was in the act of passing away.</span> The Greek word is the same as that on which our translators have rung so many changes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1Corinthians 13:8-11</a>.

This he does in three important particulars. <span class="ital">If the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones </span>— That is, the Mosaic dispensation, the most important part of which was engraven on two tables of stone, and which proved a ministration of death to those who preferred it to the gospel, and which still subjects such to death, pronouncing an awful curse upon all that in any respect violate it; <span class="ital">was glorious </span>— Was attended with a signal and undeniable glory, a glory even reflected on the face of its minister, in such a degree that the Israelites could not bear steadfastly to behold the splendour of his countenance; <span class="ital">how shall not the ministration of the Spirit </span>— The Christian dispensation, under which the Holy Spirit, in his gifts and graces, is much more largely communicated than it was under the law; <span class="ital">be rather glorious </span>— Since the operations and graces of the Spirit of God in the heart of a rational being are so much more important than any dead characters which could be engraven on insensible stones. To be a little more particular: — The law, even the best part of it, that engraven on stones, is here properly termed <span class="ital">the ministration of death </span>— Because, 1st, It condemned wilful transgressors in certain cases, (as sabbath-breakers, adulteresses, and those disobedient to parents,) to temporal death; so that they <span class="ital">died without mercy under two or three witnesses </span>attesting their guilt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-28.htm" title="He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:">Hebrews 10:28</a>. nding all dead, or doomed to die, temporally, it had no resurrection to announce or promise. 3d, Spiritual, as well as temporal death, having entered into the world by the first great transgression, and all being involved therein, namely, destitute of the favour of God, (which <span class="ital">is life, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm" title="For his anger endures but a moment; in his favor is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.">Psalm 30:5</a>,) of union with him, and a spiritual mind, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-6.htm" title="For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.">Romans 8:6</a>,) it could not quicken them, or make them alive to God. Its sacrifices could not procure men God’s forfeited favour, much less assure them of it. Its precepts, through men’s inability to keep them, could not introduce them to union with him, and its carnal ordinances and worldly promises could not render them spiritually minded. Thus the letter, that external, emblematical, and shadowy dispensation, killed such as adhered to it, and rejected the gospel; <span class="ital">but the Spirit giveth life. </span>As the Spirit of God is the grand promise of the new covenant, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm" title="For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground: I will pour my spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-21.htm" title="As for me, this is my covenant with them, said the LORD; My spirit that is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed, said the LORD, from now on and for ever.">Isaiah 59:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink....">John 7:37-38</a>,) so by this the gospel doctrines, precepts, and promises, are made spirit and life to us; repentance unto life and living faith are begotten in us, the favour of God is manifested, and union with God imparted, productive of <span class="ital">a spiritual mind, which is life and peace.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if the ministration of death - In the previous verses, Paul had referred incidentally to the institutions of Moses, and to the superiority of the gospel. He had said that the former were engraved on stones, but the latter on the heart <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>; that the letter of the former tended to death, but the latter to life <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>. This sentiment he proceeds further to illustrate, by showing in what the superior glory of the gospel consisted. The design of the whole is, to illustrate the nature, and to show the importance of the ministerial office; and the manner in which the duties of that office were to be performed. That the phrase "ministration of death" refers to the Mosaic institutions, the connection sufficiently indicates, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-13.htm">2 Corinthians 3:13-15</a>. The word "ministration" (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  diakonia) means, properly, ministry; the office of ministering in divine things. It is usually applied to the officers of the church in the New Testament, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm">Acts 1:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-25.htm">Acts 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-5.htm">1 Corinthians 12:5</a>.<p>The word here, however, seems to refer to the whole arrangement under the Mosaic economy, by which his laws were promulgated, and perpetuated. The expression "a ministration - written and engraved on stone," is somewhat harsh; but the sense evidently is, the ministration of a covenant, or of laws written on stones. The word "ministration "there refers to the arrangement, office, etc. by which the knowledge of these laws was maintained; the ministering under a system like that of the Jewish; or, more strictly, the act and occasion on which Moses himself ministered, or promulgated that system to the Jews, and when the glory of the work was irradiated even from His countenance. And the purpose of the apostle is to show that the ministry of the gospel is more glorious than even the ministry of Moses, when he was admitted near to God on the holy mountain; and when such a glory attended his receiving and promulgating the Law. It is called the "ministration of death," because it tended to condemnation; it did not speak of pardon; it was suited only to deepen the sense of sin, and to produce alarm and dread; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>.<p>Written and engraven in stones - The Ten Commandments - the substance of all the Mosaic institutes, and the principal laws of his economy - were written or engraved on tables of stone.<p>Was glorious - Was attended with magnificence and splendor. The glory here referred to, consisted in the circumstance of sublimity and grandeur in which the Law of Moses was given, It was:<p>(1) The glory of God as he was manifested on Mount Sinai, as the Lawgiver and Ruler of the people.<p>(2) the glory of the attending circumstances, of thunder, fire, etc. in which God appeared. The Law was given in these circumstances. Its giving - called here the "ministration" - was amidst such displays of the glory of God. It was,<p>(3) A high honor and glory for Moses to be permitted to approach so near to God; to commune with him; and to receive at his hand the Law for his people, and for the world. These were circumstances of imposing majesty and grandeur, which, however, Paul says were eclipsed and surpassed by the ministry of the gospel.<p>So that the children of Israel ... - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-30</a>, it is said, that "When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone, while He talked with him. And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him." The word rendered "steadfastly behold" (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  atenisai), means to gaze intently upon; to look steadily, or constantly, or fixedly; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>. There was a dazzling splendor, an irradiation; a diffusion of light, such that they could not look intently and steadily upon it - as we cannot look steadily at the sun. How this was produced, is not known. It cannot be accounted for from natural causes, and was doubtless designed to be to the Israelites an attestation that Moses had been with God, and was commissioned by him. They would see:<p>(1) That it was unnatural, such as no known cause could produce; and,<p>(2) Not improbably they would recognize a resemblance to the manner in which God usually appeared - the glory of the Shechinah in which he so frequently manifested himself to them. It would be to them, therefore, a demonstration that Moses had been with God.<p>Which glory was to be done away - The splendor of that scene was transitory. It did not last. It was soon destroyed (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  te&#772;n katargoumene&#772;n. It was not adapted or designed long to continue. This does not mean, as Doddridge supposes, "soon to be abolished in death;" or, as others, "ceasing with youth;" but it means, that the shining or the splendor was transitory; it was soon to cease; it was not designed to be permanent. Neither the wonderful scenes accompanying the giving of the Law on Sinai, nor the shining on the countenance of Moses, was designed to abide. The thunders of Sinai would cease to roll; the lightenings to play; the visible manifestations of the presence of God would all be gone; and the supernatural illumination of the face of Moses also would soon cease - perhaps as Macknight, Bloomfield, and others suppose, as a prefiguration of the abrogation of the glory of the whole system of the Levitical law. Paul certainly means to say, that the glory of Moses, and of his dispensation, was a fading glory; but that the glory of the gospel would be permanent, and increasing forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. the ministration of death&#8212;the legal dispensation, summed up in the Decalogue, which denounces death against man for transgression.<p>written and engraven in stones&#8212;There is no "and" in the Greek. The literal translation is, "The ministration of death in letters," of which "engraven on stones" is an explanation. The preponderance of oldest manuscripts is for the English Version reading. But one (perhaps the oldest existing manuscript) has "in the letter," which refers to the preceding words (2Co 3:6), "the letter killeth," and this seems the probable reading. Even if we read as English Version, "The ministration of death (written) in letters," alludes to the literal precepts of the law as only bringing us the knowledge of sin and "death," in contrast to "the Spirit" in the Gospel bringing us "life" (2Co 3:6). The opposition between "the letters" and "the Spirit" (2Co 3:8) confirms this. This explains why the phrase in Greek should be "in letters," instead of the ordinary one which English Version has substituted, "written and."<p>was glorious&#8212;literally, "was made (invested) in glory," glory was the atmosphere with which it was encompassed.<p>could not steadfastly behold&#8212;literally, "fix their eyes on." Ex 34:30, "The skin of his face shone; and they were AFRAID to come nigh him." "Could not," therefore means here, "for FEAR." The "glory of Moses' countenance" on Sinai passed away when the occasion was over: a type of the transitory character of the dispensation which he represented (2Co 3:11), as contrasted with the permanency of the Christian dispensation (2Co 3:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle is manifestly comparing the ministry of the gospel with the ministry of the law, and showing the excellency of the former above the latter. In the former verse he had called the law, <span class="ital">the letter; </span> and the gospel, in opposition to it, he had called, the spirit: here he calleth the ministration of the law, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the ministration of death; </span> because it only showed man his duty, or things to be done, but gave no strength or help by which he should do them; only cursing man, but showing him no way by which he might escape that curse: so it did kill men, and led them to eternal death and condemnation, without showing them any means of life and salvation. He also undervalueth the law, in comparison with the gospel, as being only <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">written and engraven in stones; </span> whereas (as he had said before) the gospel is written <span class="ital">in the fleshy tables of</span> men’s hearts.

The apostle having observed the difference between the law and the Gospel, the one being a killing letter, the other a quickening spirit, enlarges upon it, and more, fully explains it; and proceeds to take notice of other things in which they differ; and to show the superior glory and excellency of the one to the other; for that by "the ministration of death", he means the law, as delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai, is clear from its being said to be <p>written and engraven in stones; as that was by the finger of God himself: rightly does the apostle say, that it was both "written" and "engraven"; for the two tables of the law are expressly said to be written with the finger of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a> meaning either the Spirit of God, who is sometimes so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a> or the power of God, which at once caused this writing to exist; and it is in so many words affirmed, that "the writing" was "the writing of God"; and not of man, nor of any creature, no not of an angel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a> yea, even the two tables which were hewn out by Moses, after the first were broken, were written upon by the Lord himself, and not Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a>. So that as the work of the tables was the work of God, and wonderfully made, the form of the letters, as Abarbinel (x) observes, were miraculously made by him; for this law was, , "in letters", as the apostle here says; and as it was written in the Hebrew language, very likely it was in the same form of letters now in use with the Jews; though some have thought that the Samaritan letters are the original ones: moreover, the law was not only written, but "engraved"; for so it is said, that the writing was graven upon the tables, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a> and though the word so rendered is no where else used but there, it is rightly rendered graven, as appears by the apostle in this place; and which may lie confirmed by the Targumist on that, who renders it by  "engraven"; and by the Septuagint  which signifies the same; and so in the book of Zohar (y), the letters are said to be  "engraven" on the tables: and that the tables were tables of stone, it is certain; they are often so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a> wherefore the apostle very properly says, that the law was engraven "in stones"; but what stones these tables were made of cannot be said; the Jews, who affect to know everything, will have them to be precious stones, but what they were they are not agreed in; for though they generally say (z) they were made of the sapphire stone, and sometimes say (a) they were hewed out of the sapphire of the glorious throne of God; yet at other times they call them marble tables (b); and Aben Ezra (c) was of opinion, that the tables which Moses hewed were not of any precious stone, for he asks where should a precious stone of such size be found? though others pretend to say (d), that Moses in a miraculous manner was shown a sapphire quarry in the midst of his tent, out of which he cut and hewed the stones; but very likely they were common ones; however, certain it is, that the tables of stone, as written and engraven by the Lord himself, were made, as the apostle here says, "in glory",  ; and so Jarchi on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a> "and the tables were the work of God", says, this is to be understood literally  "and in" or "for his glory"; or by his glorious power he made them: now this law, though thus written and engraven, and glorious, it was "the ministration of death"; and is so called, because it threatened and punished the transgressors of it with a corporeal death; they that sinned against it died without mercy upon proper evidence and witnesses; every precept of it had this penalty annexed to it, in ease of disobedience; as the having any other goals but one, making of graven images, taking the name of God in vain, the violation of the sabbath, dishonouring of parents, murder, adultery, theft, and covetousness; instances there are of each of these being punishable by this law with a bodily death: and besides, it is the ministration of eternal death, the wages of sin the transgression of the law; which is that wrath of God, a sense of which it is said to work; the curse it threatens with and the second death or lake of fire it casts into: and may be said to be the "ministration" of it; as it shows persons they are deserving of it, pronounces the sentence of it on them, and will execute it upon them, if grace prevent not; now though it was the ministration of death, yet it <p>was glorious. There were many things which made it so; but what the apostle here particularly takes notice of is the glory that was upon the face of Moses, when he received it and brought it from the Lord, which was very great; <p>so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away. The history of this may be read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29</a> it was a real visible glory that was upon the skin of his face, so that it shone again; it is said, "the skin of his face shone"; and this shining of his face the apostle very properly calls "the glory of his countenance": agreeably to the Septuagint version, which renders it, "the appearance of the skin, or colour of his face, was glorified"; and still nearer to the paraphrase of Onkelos, which is, "the splendour of the glory of his countenance was great"; and to the Targum of Jonathan, which also assigns the reason of it, and which seems to be the true one, "the splendour of the form of his countenance was glorious, because of the splendour of the glory of the majesty of God, at the time he talked with him". The Vulgate Latin version has led many wrong, to paint Moses with two horns, rendering it, "his face was horned", the Hebrew word having the signification of an horn in its derivative; because glory darted from him like horns, as rays of light do from the sun; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a> and this brightness and glory were so very great, and so dazzling, that Aaron and the people of Israel were afraid to come nigh; which Jarchi, a Jewish writer, imputed to their sin, and shame, and fear, having worshipped the calf; but our apostle ascribes it to the lustre of his countenance, which was such that they could not steadfastly look upon it; they saw it indeed, as it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-35.htm">Exodus 34:35</a> yet they could not look wistly at it, nor bear the splendour of it; though this was only a glory, which was to continue but a while; according to the opinion of Ambrose (e), this glory continued on Moses's countenance as long as he lived; but be it so, it at last was done away: now this glory was put there to bear a testimony to the divine authority of the law, that it came from God, and was to be received at the hands of Moses, with awful reverence as from God, and to make them afraid of violating a law which came with such majesty and glory; and also to command awe and respect from the Israelites to Moses, whom they were inclined at every turn to treat with contempt, and to let them see that he had communion with God, which this was the effect of: now this was a circumstance which rendered the law glorious, and was expressive of a real glory in it; which, though as this on Moses's face, "was to be done away"; wherefore the apostle argues; <p>(x) In loc.

St. Paul here begins one of the arguments <span class="accented">a minori ad majus</span> which are the very basis of the Epistle to the Hebrews. <span class="cmt_word">Written and engraven in stones;</span> literally, <span class="accented">engraved in letters on stones</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). The reference shows that, in speaking of "the letter," St. Paul was only thinking of the Mosaic Law, and indeed specifically of the Decalogue. <span class="cmt_word">Was glorious;</span> literally, <span class="accented">occurred in glory</span>, or, <span class="accented">proved itself glorious</span>. In itself the Law was "holy, just, and good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>), and given "at the disposition of angels" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>); and its transitory glory was illustrated by the lustre which the face of Moses caught by reflection from his intercourse with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29, 30</a>). St. Paul has been led quite incidentally into this digression in the course of defending himself by describing the nature of his ministry; but it bore very definitely on his general purpose, because his chief opponents were Judaists, whose one aim it was to bind upon the Church the yoke of Mosaism. That they could not "behold" the face of Moses is the <span class="accented">hagadah</span>, or traditional legend, derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-30.htm">Exodus 34:30</a>, which says that "they were afraid to <span class="accented">draw nigh</span> to him. The reader may recall the beautiful lines of Cardinal Newman- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Lord l grant me this abiding grace -<br />Thy words and saints to know;<br />To pierce the veil on Moses' face,<br />Although his words be slow."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Because of the glory of his countenance.</span> This circumstance is so often alluded to as to have become identified with the conception of Moses. The Hebrew words for "a ray of light" and "a horn" are identical; hence, instead of saying that his face was "irradiated," the Vulgate says, <span class="accented">Cornnta erat ejus facies</span>; and even in our version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a> we find "And he had <span class="accented">horns</span> [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. 'rays of light'] coming out of his hand." To this is due the mediaeval symbol of Moses with horns, as in the matchless statue by Michael Angelo. <span class="cmt_word">Which glory was to be done away.</span> The Greek might be expressed by "the glory - the evanescing glory  - of his countenance." It was not "to <span class="accented">be</span> done away," but from the first moment they saw it it began to vanish. The verb "to do away," implying annulment, and the being abrogated as invalid, is a characteristic word in this group cf Epistles, in which it occurs twenty-two times. This illustrates the prominence in St. Paul's thoughts of the fact that the Law was now "antiquated" and "near its obliteration" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). But in dwelling on the brief and transient character of this radiance, St. Paul seizes on a point which (naturally) is not dwelt upon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34.htm">Exodus 34</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The ministration of death (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Because it is the ministry of the letter which killeth.

The ministration of death (see above) is that of Moses, and does not apply to his entire career as Israel's lawgiver, but to his particular ministry in receiving on Sinai and transmitting to the people the law of God. The ministration may be said to have been graven on stones, since the whole purport of that economy which he represented was contained in the tables, and he was its minister in being the agent through whom God delivered it to the people.<p>Was glorious (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>A very inadequate translation. &#x395;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; means came to pass or took place, not simply was. A glory passed from God to Moses, so that his face became shining. It is much more graphic and truthful to render &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#837; literally, in or with glory, than to convert the two words into a single adjective, glorious. Rev., much better, came with glory.<p>Steadfastly behold (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-20.htm">Luke 4:20</a>.<p>Passing away (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., being done away or brought to nought.
