Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.">Romans 11:7</a>. Here, as applied to the faculties of perception, “blinded” is, perhaps, a legitimate rendering.<p><span class= "bld">Remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament . . .</span>—The words are better translated: <span class= "ital">the same veil remaineth in the reading of the old covenant; the fact not being revealed </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by the removal of the veil) <span class= "ital">that it</span> (the old covenant) <span class= "ital">is being done away in Christ</span> The figure is passing through a kind of dissolving change. There is still a veil between the hearers of the Law and its true meaning; but the veil is no longer on the face of the law-giver, but on their hearts; and the reason of this is that, the veil not being withdrawn, they do not see that the glory of the older covenant is done away by the brightness of the new. It is doing violence to the context to refer to the veil the words “is done away,” which through the whole passage is applied to the Law itself; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.">2Corinthians 3:16</a> a new and appropriate word is used for the withdrawal of the veil. It is, the Apostle says, because the veil of prejudice and tradition hinders them from seeing the truth that the Jews of his own time still think of the Law as permanent, instead of looking on it as passing through a process of extinction. The “Old Testament” is clearly used, not, as in the modern sense, for the whole volume of the Law—Prophets and Psalms—but specially for the law which was the basis of the covenant. The other, but less adequate, rendering would be, <span class= "ital">the veil remaineth</span> . . . <span class= "ital">unwithdrawn, for it</span> (the veil) <span class= "ital">is abolished in Christ.</span> If there was any authority for giving an active force to the middle form of the verb, we might translate with a perfectly satisfactory meaning, <span class= "ital">the same veil remaineth</span> . . . <span class= "ital">not revealing the fact that it is being done away in Christ;</span> but unfortunately there is no such authority. The English, “which veil is done away,” fails to give, in any case, the true force of the Greek.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 It is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to use great plainness, or clearness, of speech. The Old Testament believers had only cloudy and passing glimpses of that glorious Saviour, and unbelievers looked no further than to the outward institution. But the great precepts of the gospel, believe, love, obey, are truths stated as clearly as possible. And the whole doctrine of Christ crucified, is made as plain as human language can make it. Those who lived under the law, had a veil upon their hearts. This veil is taken away by the doctrines of the Bible about Christ. When any person is converted to God, then the veil of ignorance is taken away. The condition of those who enjoy and believe the gospel is happy, for the heart is set at liberty to run the ways of God's commandments. They have light, and with open face they behold the glory of the Lord. Christians should prize and improve these privileges. We should not rest contented without knowing the transforming power of the gospel, by the working of the Spirit, bringing us to seek to be like the temper and tendency of the glorious gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and into union with Him. We behold Christ, as in the glass of his word; and as the reflection from a mirror causes the face to shine, the faces of Christians shine also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But their minds were blinded - The word used here (&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;  po&#772;roo&#772;) means rather to harden; to make hard like stone; and then to make dull or stupid. It is applied to the heart, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17</a>; to persons, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7</a>; and to the eyes, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-7.htm">Job 17:7</a>. Paul refers here to the fact that the understandings of the Jews were stupid, dull, and insensible, so that they did not see clearly the design and end of their own institutions. He states simply the fact; he does not refer to the cause of it. The fact that the Jews were thus stupid and dull is often affirmed in the New Testament.<p>For until this day ... - The sense of this is, that even to the time when Paul wrote, it was a characteristic of the great mass of the Jewish people, that they did not understand the true sense of their own Scriptures. They did not understand its doctrines in regard to the Messiah. A veil seems to be thrown over the Old Testament when they read it, as there was over the face of Moses, so that the glory of their own Scriptures is concealed from their view, as the glory of the face of Moses was hidden.<p>Of the Old Testament - Greek, "of the old covenant." See this word "testament," or covenant, explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-25.htm">1 Corinthians 11:25</a>. This, I believe, is the only instance in which the Scriptures of the Jews are called the "Old Testament," or covenant, in the Bible. It was, of course, not a name which they used, or would use; but it is now with Christians the common appellation. No doubt can be entertained but that Paul uses the terms in the same manner in which we now do, and refers to all the inspired writings of the Jews.<p>Which vail is done away in Christ - In the manifestation, or appearance of Jesus the Messiah, the veil is removed. The obscurity which rested on the prophecies and types of the former dispensation is withdrawn; and as the face of Moses could have been distinctly seen if the veil on his face had been removed, so it is in regard to the true meaning of the Old Testament by the coming of the Messiah. What was obscure is now made clear; and the prophecies are so completely fulfilled in him, that his coming has removed the covering, and shed a clear light over them all. Many of the prophecies, for example, until the Messiah actually appeared, appeared obscure, and almost contradictory. Those which spoke of him, for illustration, as man and as God; as suffering, and yet reigning; as dying, and yet as ever-living; as a mighty Prince, a conqueror, and a king, and yet as a man of sorrows; as humble, and yet glorious: all seemed difficult to be reconciled until they were seen to harmonize in Jesus of Nazareth. Then they were plain, and the veil was taken away. Christ is seen to answer all the previous descriptions of him in the Old Testament; and his coming casts a clear light on all which was before obscure. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-18.

If they once saw that the law is done away in Him, the veil would be no longer on their hearts in reading it publicly in their synagogues (so "reading" means, Ac 15:21).

But the veil, that is drawn over men’s hearts, is not taken away, till they come to receive Jesus Christ as the end of the law for righteousness, to close with him, and to believe in him. God hath taken the veil off from Christ, by sending him personally to fulfil all righteousness; but Christ profiteth nothing particular souls, until they come to believe in him, then it is taken away from their souls, and not before.

Mem.</span> ii. 1. 30) the information why it remains unlifted,—an interpretation, however, which would only be compatible with the <span class="ital">first</span> view given above, and even with that would be unnecessar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καταργεῖται</span>] <span class="ital">present</span>; for the fact, that in Christ the Old Covenant is abolished, is laid down in <span class="ital">theoretical</span> form as an <span class="ital">article of faith</span>, as a <span class="ital">truth</span> which remains veiled from the Jews so long as they are not converted to Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.">2 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[170] <span class="greekheb">πωροῦσθαι</span> means <span class="ital">to be made hard</span> (from the substantive <span class="greekheb">πῶρος</span>), not <span class="ital">to be blinded</span>, as Schleusner (<span class="ital">Thes</span>. IV. p. 541) and others, following the Fathers, and also Hofmann would take it, since there is no trace at all of the use among the Greeks of an adjective <span class="greekheb">πωρός</span>, <span class="ital">blind</span>, which the Etymol. Gud. and Suidas quote. The Greeks have <span class="greekheb">πῆρος</span>, <span class="ital">blindness</span>, and <span class="greekheb">πήρος</span>, <span class="ital">blind</span>, but not <span class="greekheb">πωρός</span>. And if the LXX. translate כָּהָה, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-7.htm" title="O remember that my life is wind: my eye shall no more see good.">Job 7:7</a>, by <span class="greekheb">πωροῦσθαι</span>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-17.htm" title="Woe to the idol shepherd that leaves the flock! the sword shall be on his arm, and on his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.">Zechariah 11:17</a> by <span class="greekheb">ἐκτυφλοῦσθαι</span> (to which Hofmann makes appeal), this proves nothing in favour of that explanation of <span class="greekheb">πωροῦσθαι</span>, since the LXX. very often, with exegetical freedom, render the same word differently according to the context. We may add that Hofmann irrelevantly compares Lucian, Amor. 46, where <span class="greekheb">πηροί</span> does not mean blind at all, but has its fundamental meaning maimed. The passage in Lucian means: “To whom are the glances of the eyes so blind (<span class="greekheb">τυφλοί</span>), and the thoughts of the understanding so lame (<span class="greekheb">πηροί</span>)?” Here <span class="greekheb">πηροί</span> is a figurative expression for weakness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[171] So among the older commentators Castalio, and recently Kypke, Flatt, Osiander, Maier; comp. also Krummel, who, however, mentally supplies “<span class="ital">by all teachers of the law</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[172] Very naturally and suitably Paul chose the word <span class="greekheb">ἀνακαλ</span>., not <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλ</span>.

(See J. A. Robinson in <span class="ital">Journal of Theological Studies</span>, Oct., 1901, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> reff. above.)—<span class="greekheb">ἄχρι γὰρ τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">f1τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">for until this very day at the reading of the Old Covenant the same veil remaineth unlifted</span> (<span class="ital">for it is</span> only <span class="ital">done away in Christ</span>). (1) Some commentators take <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον</span> as a nominative absolute, and translate “the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed that it (<span class="ital">sc.</span>, either the veil or the Old Covenant) is done away in Christ”. But the order of the words seems to force us to take the present participle with <span class="greekheb">μένει</span>—it having a merely explanatory force and being almost redundant. (2) Again both A.V. and R.V. (text), while translating the first part of the clause as we have done, render <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι ἐν Χρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καταργεῖται</span> “which veil is done away in Christ”. But it seems indefensible thus to take <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>. (3) Field arrives at yet another rendering by taking <span class="greekheb">κάλυμμα</span> <span class="ital">per synecdochem</span> for the <span class="ital">thing veiled</span>, which is here declared to be the fact that the Old Covenant is done away in Christ. He renders “the same mystery remaineth unrevealed, <span class="ital">namely</span>, that it is done away in Christ”. But it is a grave objection to this that <span class="greekheb">τὸ κάλυμμα</span> has to be taken in a sense different from that which it has all through the rest of the passage. (4) We prefer, therefore (with Schmiedel and Schnedermann), to read <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι</span> as <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>, and to regard the phrase <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐν χρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καταργεῖται</span>. as parenthetical: “until this day the veil remains unlifted (for it is only in Christ that it is done away)”; <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the Jews do not recognise the vanishing away of the glory of the Law, which yet is going on before their eyes. How completely Judaism was dissociated in St. Paul’s mind from Christianity is plain from the striking phrase <span class="greekheb">ἡ παλαιὰ διαθήκη</span> (here only found; but <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>), by which he describes the religious system of his own early manhood, which had only been superseded by <span class="greekheb">ἡ καινὴ διαθήκη</span> thirty years before he wrote this letter. <span class="greekheb">ἀνάγνωσις</span> is (see reff.) the public reading of the Law in the synagogues; it seems, however, unnecessarily ingenious to see here, with Schmiedel, an allusion in <span class="greekheb">τὸ κάλυμμα</span> to the covers in which the Synagogue Rolls were preserved.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>14. <span class="ital">But their minds were blinded</span>] They neither obeyed the Law when it was given, nor would cease to obey it when it was superseded.

The rendering <span class="ital">blinded</span> is justified by the fact that many cases of what is called cataract are attributable to the hardening of the crystalline lens of the eye into a chalky substance, a process for which the Greek word here used is a proper equivalent.

The reasons for this rendering are (1) that it is not the <span class="ital">veil</span> but the <span class="ital">old covenant</span> with its glories which is ‘done away in Christ,’ (2) that St Paul uses <span class="ital">another</span> word in the original to signify the taking away of the veil, and (3) that the hardness of the hearts of the Israelites, and not the doing away of the veil in Christ, is the reason the veil is not removed. This hardness of heart prevented them (1) from seeing that the Mosaic was a temporary covenant, and (2) that it was rendered unnecessary by the coming of Christ.

By whom were their minds hardened?

The veil which prevented them from seeing the evanescence of the light which shone on the face of Moses was symbolically identical  with that which prevented them also from seeing the transitory character of his Law. It had been as it were taken from his face and laid on their hearts (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>.). Many commentators have seen in this verse a reference to the Jewish custom of covering the head with the <span class="accented">tallith</span>, a four-cornered veil, when they were in the synagogues. But this is doubtful, since the <span class="accented">tallith</span> did not cover the eyes. More probably his metaphor may have been suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>, "And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast ever all people, and <span class="accented">the veil</span> that is spread over all nations." <span class="cmt_word">Untaken away.</span> There are two other ways of rendering this verse: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "For until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth unlifted; which veil is done away in Christ," as in the Revised Version; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "The same veil remaineth, it not being revealed that it is done away in Christ," as it is taken by Chrysostom and many others, and in the margin of the Revised Version. The latter seems to be the better view. It is not the veil, but the old covenant, which is being done away in Christ. To the Jews that truth still remained under a veil. The present tense, "is <span class="accented">in course</span> of annulment," might naturally be used until the utter abrogation of even the possible fulfilment of the Mosaic Law at the fall of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">In the reading of the old testament;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the old covenant</span>.

Further, the reading of the best texts is &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; that or because, and not &#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9; which. Because is not true to the fact, since the veil remains unlifted, not because it is done away in Christ, but because of the hardness of their hearts. It is better, therefore, to take &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; unlifted, as a nominative absolute, and to render, it not being revealed that it (the veil) is being done away in Christ. This falls in naturally with the drift of the whole passage. The veil remains on their hearts, since it is not revealed to them that the Mosaic economy is done away in Christ. </body></html>
