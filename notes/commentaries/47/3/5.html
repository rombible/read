The habit of mind which led St. Paul to emphasise the shades of meaning in Greek prepositions to an extent hardly to be expressed in English, and not commonly recognised, it may be, in colloquial Greek, is seen again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm" title="For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.

See the <span class="ital">Introduction to the New Testament, </span>p. 3. That Isaiah , 1 st, Of the covenant of <span class="ital">grace, </span>made with man after the fall; a covenant which makes provision for pardoning his guilt, renewing his depraved nature, and strengthening his weakness; purposes for which the former covenant, that of justice, established before the fall, made no provision; man, while in innocence, not needing it: 2d, And more especially, the <span class="ital">new covenant </span>here means the last and best dispensation of the covenant of grace, that made through the Messiah come in the flesh, in opposition to the two former dispensations of the covenant of grace, the Patriarchal and Mosaic. <span class="ital">Not of the letter </span>— Not of the law, fitly called <span class="ital">the letter, </span>from God’s writing the best part of it on the two tables; <span class="ital">but of the spirit </span>— Of the gospel dispensation, written on the tables of our hearts by the Spirit. Or rather, the apostle means that the true ministers of Christ are not merely ministers of the letter even of the gospel covenant; they not only bear testimony to, and enforce the literal knowledge of it, or that which is in mere theory, but the spiritual or experimental knowledge of it: that is, they not only endeavour to communicate to their hearers just, clear, and full views of the gospel in all its parts, but to bring them to have a lively and operative faith in its doctrines, producing in them a change of nature; to possess its graces, enjoy its privileges, and practise its duties. <span class="ital">For the letter killeth </span>— The law, the Mosaic dispensation, seals in death those who still cleave to it; <span class="ital">but the spirit </span>— The gospel, instrumental in conveying the Spirit of God to those who receive it with a true and lively faith; <span class="ital">giveth life </span>— Both spiritual and eternal. Yea, if we adhere to the literal sense even of the moral law, if we regard only the precept and the sanction, as they stand in themselves, not as they lead us to Christ, they are doubtless a killing ordinance, and bind us down under the sentence of death. Nor is this all that the apostle means: but if we rest in the literal and merely notional knowledge of the new covenant itself, it not only will not justify and save us, but will condemn us to a greater death than that to which we were exposed by the sin of Adam: our condemnation will be aggravated, and our future misery increased through our misuse, or abuse rather, of so gracious a dispensation, a remedy provided in great mercy and love for the healing of our spiritual disorders and the saving of our souls. In other words, if we content ourselves with having right views of the gospel, of its truths and duties, privileges and blessings, and do not receive them in true repentance, living faith, sincere love, and new obedience; if we be satisfied with understanding the nature of the graces of God’s Spirit, and of justification, regeneration, and sanctification, and remain without the real possession and enjoyment of these blessings, the light we have, and our correct ideas of these things, will only render us the more inexcusable before God, and expose us to greater wrath than could have come upon us, if we had not been favoured with that knowledge and these advantages. On the other hand, the spiritual and experimental knowledge of the new covenant in all its branches, the knowledge communicated by the Holy Spirit, <span class="ital">giveth life. </span>It quickens the soul, before dead to God and divine things, dead in a state of guilt, depravity, and weakness; it justifies the ungodly, sanctifies the unholy, unites to God those who had been alienated from his life, stamps them with his image, communicates to them his nature, and renders them spiritually minded, which is life and peace. And while it imparts the life of grace, it gives a title to, a meetness for, and a foretaste of, the life of glory. To spread this spiritual, experimental, and practical knowledge of the new covenant, therefore, is the chief concern, and endeavour of every true minister of Christ; and for this work every such a one is qualified by being savingly made acquainted with its nature, excellence, and glory, in consequence of which he can and will not only speak justly and clearly concerning it, but with zeal, fervency, and deep concern, that his message may be properly received and obeyed by all who hear him. Understanding the doctrines, possessing the graces, practising the duties, and enjoying the privileges of this new dispensation himself, he speaks with sincerity and pathos; speaks <span class="ital">what he knows, </span>and <span class="ital">testifies what he has seen, </span>or experienced; and his words, proceeding from the heart, and uttered with feeling, seldom fail to reach the heart: while in the mean time, his spirit and conduct, his holy tempers, words, and actions, strongly recommend his doctrine, and powerfully enforce all his exhortations, the Lord Jesus, according to his promise, being with him in all his ministrations, and giving efficacy to the word of his grace.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves - This is evidently designed to guard against the appearance of boasting, or of self-confidence. He had spoken of his confidence; of his triumph; of his success; of his undoubted evidence that God had sent him. He here says, that he did not mean to be understood as affirming that any of his success came from himself, or that he was able by his own strength to accomplish the great things which had been effected by his ministry. He well knew that he had no such self-sufficiency; and he would not insinuate, in the slightest manner, that he believed himself to be invested with any such power, compare note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>.<p>To think anything - (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;  logisasthai ti). The word used here means properly to reason, think, consider; and then to reckon, count to, or impute to anyone. It is the word which is commonly rendered impute; see it explained more fully in the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-5.htm">Romans 4:5</a>. Robinson (Lexicon) renders it in this place, "to reason out, to think out, to find out by thinking." Doddridge renders it, "to reckon upon anything as from ourselves." Whitby renders it, "to reason; as if the apostle had said, We are unable by any reasoning of our own to bring people to conversion. Macknight gives a similar sense. Locke renders it, "Not as if I were sufficient of myself, to reckon upon anything as from myself:" and explains it to mean that Paul was not sufficient of himself by any strength of natural parts to attain the knowledge of the gospel truths which he preached. The word may be rendered here, to reckon, reason, think, etc.; but it should be confined to the immediate subject under consideration. It does not refer to thinking in general; or to the power of thought on any, and on all subjects - however true it may be in itself but to the preaching the gospel. And the expression may be regarded as referring to the following points, which are immediately under discussion:<p>(1) Paul did not feel that he was sufficient of himself to have reasoned or thought out the truths of the gospel. They were communicated by God.<p>(2) he had no power by reasoning to convince or convert sinners. That was all of God.<p>(3) he had no right to reckon on success by any strength of his own. All success was to be traced to God. It is, however, also true, that all our powers of thinking and reasoning are from God; and that we have no ability to think clearly, to reason calmly, closely, and correctly, unless he shall preside over our minds and give us clearness of thought. How easy is it for God to disarrange all our faculties, and produce insanity! How easy to suffer our minds to become unsettled, bewildered, and distracted with a multiplicity of thoughts! How easy to cause every thing to appear cloudy, and dark, and misty! How easy to affect our bodies with weakness, langor, disease, and through them to destroy all power of close and consecutive thought! No one who considers on how many things the power of close thinking depends, can doubt that all our sufficiency in this is from God; and that we owe to him every clear idea on the subjects of common life, and on scientific subjects, no less certainly than we do in the truths of religion, compare the case of Bezaleel and Aholiab in common arts, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. The Greek is, "Not that we are (even yet after so long experience as ministers) sufficient to think anything OF ourselves as (coming) FROM ourselves; but our sufficiency is (derived) FROM God." "From" more definitely refers to the source out of which a thing comes; "of" is more general.<p>to think&#8212;Greek, to "reason out" or "devise"; to attain to sound preaching by our reasonings [Theodoret]. The "we" refers here to ministers (2Pe 1:21).<p>anything&#8212;even the least. We cannot expect too little from man, or too much from God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I would not have you think that we judge ourselves sufficient to work a change in the hearts of men; we are so far from that, that we have no sufficiency so much as to think one good thought, which is the lowest human act. Though the subject, upon which the apostle is here discoursing, be a sufficiency to work a work of grace in the hearts of men; yet here is a strong proof to prove the impotency of man’s will unto any thing that is truly and spiritually good: for though the apostle declares here his own and all other ministers’ insufficiency to the change of any man’s heart, yet he proveth it by an argument, concluding from the lesser to the greater; for if they be not sufficient of themselves, and as of themselves, to think any thing which is truly and spiritually good, they are then much less sufficient for so great a work as the conversion of souls. Nor doth that term, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">as of ourselves, </span> any thing alter the matter; for if we can think good thoughts, in any sense, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">as of ourselves, </span> it is not <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">of God, </span> in the sense which the apostle is speaking of; who is not here speaking of God as the God of nature, (from whom indeed we derive our power of thinking), but as the God of grace, from whom we derive our power of thinking holy thoughts, and such as are truly and spiritually good. The apostle determineth all our sufficiency to spiritually good actions to be from God, our sufficiency to the lowest (which is thinking good thoughts) as well as to those of the highest sort; amongst which must those actions be accounted, by which men are made workers together with God, in the bringing of souls out of darkness into marvellous light; opening their eyes, turning them <span class="ital">from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a></span>. Our sufficiency to think any thoughts, or to do any natural or moral actions, is from God, as he is the God of nature. But it appeareth from all the preceding discourse, that our apostle is here speaking of that sufficiency which floweth from God through the mediation of Christ: our power of thinking floweth from the providence of God towards all men; and if that had been all which the apostle had meant in saying, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">our sufficieney is from God, </span> it had been no more than what they might have learned from the heathen philosophers, who would have acknowledged, that all men’s sufficiency to natural actions is from the Divine Being, or the first Mover. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves,.... Though we are sufficient for this work to which God has called us, and have such trust and confidence that he has blessed and owned us, and done such great things by us; yet we do not ascribe anything to ourselves, to any power of ours, to any self-sufficiency in us: for "we are not sufficient of ourselves" neither for the work of the ministry, nor for the conversion of sinners, nor for faith and hope in God, nor for any spiritual work whatever; not even to think anything as of ourselves; any good thing, either for our own use and benefit, or for the advantage of others; we are not able of ourselves to meditate with judgment and affection upon the word of God, to study the Scriptures, to collect from them things fit for the ministry; and much less with freedom and boldness to speak of them to edification; and still less able to impress them upon the heart: for though you who are the epistle of Christ are ministered by us, yet not by any power and self-sufficiency of ours; <p>but our sufficiency is of God; to think, to speak, and to act for his glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> sufficiency <i>is</i> of God;</span><p>(e) In that we are proper and able to make other men partakers of so great a grace.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>. Now comes the caveat, for which <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-4.htm" title="And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:">2 Corinthians 3:4</a> has prepared the way,—the guarding against the possible objection, that Paul considered himself (and Timothy) as <span class="ital">originator</span> of the ability for apostolic working. <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὅτι</span> is therefore not to be taken as equivalent to on <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οὐχ</span> (Mosheim, Schulz, Emmerling), nor is <span class="greekheb">πέποιθα</span> to be supplied again after <span class="greekheb">οὐχ</span> (Emmerling); but we have here the quite common use of <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὅτι</span> for <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐρῶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith you stand.">2 Corinthians 1:24</a>. Rückert finds in <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὅτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. a reason assigned for the <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸν θεόν</span>, or an explanation of it: “In thus speaking, I would not have it thought that,” etc. But if in <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεόν</span> there was meant to be conveyed the same idea as was further explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>, Paul would have expressed himself quite illogically, and in explaining or assigning a reason for it he must have written <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οὐχ</span>. No; the course of thought is: “With this <span class="greekheb">πεποίθησις</span>, however, I do not wish to be misunderstood or misconstrued: I do not mean by it, that we are of ourselves sufficient,” etc. With this connection <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸν θεόν</span> is not at variance; for by it God was not yet meant as <span class="ital">author of the adequate ability</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;">2 Corinthians 3:5</a> shows this very point), but as <span class="ital">producer of the result</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λογίσασθαί τι</span>] <span class="ital">to judge anything</span> (<span class="ital">censere</span>). The context furnishes the more precise definition which Paul had in view. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:...">2 Corinthians 3:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>. He denies, namely, that of himself he possesses the ability to settle in his judgment the means and ways, and, in general, the <span class="ital">mode of discharging his apostolic duties</span>. If he has just been speaking in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:...">2 Corinthians 3:2-4</a> with so much confidence of his prosperous and successful labour in Corinth, yet it is by no means his own ability, but the divine empowering, which enables him to determine by his own judgment anything regarding the discharge of his vocation. Accordingly, we can neither approve the meaning arbitrarily given to <span class="greekheb">τί</span>, <span class="ital">aliquid praeclari</span> (Emmerling; van Hengel, <span class="ital">Annot</span>. p. 219), nor agree with Hofmann, who, in consistency with his reference of <span class="greekheb">πεποίθησις</span> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place....">2 Corinthians 2:14-17</a>, makes the apostle guard against the misconstruction that this, his <span class="greekheb">πεποίθησις</span>, rests on <span class="ital">ideas which he forms for himself</span>—on an estimate of his official working, according to a standard <span class="ital">elaborated</span> by his own mind. Even apart from that erroneous reference of the <span class="greekheb">πεποίθησις</span>, the very expression <span class="greekheb">ἱκανοί</span> would be unsuitable to the meaning adopted by Hofmann, and instead of it a notion of <span class="ital">presumption</span> would rather have been in place; the prominence given to <span class="greekheb">ἱκανοτής</span> by its <span class="ital">being used thrice</span> can only concern the ability which regulates <span class="ital">the official labour itself</span>. The dogmatic exposition, disregarding the context, finds here the entire inability of the natural man for all good. See Augustine, <span class="ital">de dono persev.</span> 13, <span class="ital">contra Pelag.</span> 8; Calvin: “non poterat magis hominem nudare omni bono.” Comp. Beza, Calovius, and others, including Olshausen. The reference also of the words to the <span class="ital">doctrinal contents</span> of the preaching, which was not derived from his own reflection (Theodoret, Grotius, de Wette, Neander, and others), is not suggested by the connection, and is forbidden by the fact that <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαυτῶν</span> does not belong to <span class="greekheb">λογίσασθε</span> at all (see below). This also in opposition to Osiander, who finds the meaning. “not human, but divine thoughts lie at the root of the whole of my official work.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαυτῶν</span>] has its assured place after <span class="greekheb">λογίσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τι</span> (see the critical remarks). The contrast that follows (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ</span>) decides what it belongs to in sense,—namely, not to <span class="greekheb">λογίσασθαί τι</span>, but to <span class="greekheb">ἱκανοί ἐσμεν</span>,—so that <span class="greekheb">ἱκανοί ἐσμεν λογίσασθαί τι</span> is to be considered as <span class="ital">going together</span>, as one idea. Mistaking this, Rückert thinks that either Paul has placed the words wrongly, or the order given by B C <span class="greekheb">א</span> (see the critical remarks) must be preferred.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαυτοῦ</span>, from one’s own means, nemine suppeditante, see Wetstei.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐξ ἑαυτῶν</span>] sc. <span class="greekheb">ἱκανοὶ ὄντες λογίσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τι</span>, a more precise definition of the <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαντ</span>. inserted on purpose (making the notice thoroughly exhaustive). The proceeding from (<span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span>) is still more definitely marked as causal procession (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>): as from ourselves, i.e. as if our ability to judge anything had its origin from ourselves. Wolf arbitrarily refers <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> to the will, and <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span> to the power; and Rückert wrongly connects <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἑαυτ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">λογίσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τί</span>; it is in fact parallel to <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαυτ</span>. Paul is conscious of the <span class="greekheb">ἱκανὸν εἶναι λογίσασθαί τι</span>, and ascribes it to himself; but he denies that he has this <span class="greekheb">ἱκανότης</span> of himself, or from himsel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ ἱκανότης ἡμῶν</span>] sc. <span class="greekheb">λογίσασθαί τι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Rückert finds in our passage, especially in <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαυτῶν</span>, an allusion to some utterances, unknown to us, of opponents, which, however, cannot be proved from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance?
