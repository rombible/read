There was no narrowness in him. In that large heart of his there was room for them and for a thousand others. It had, as it were, an infinite elasticity in its sympathies. The narrowness was found in their own “bowels”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in their own affections. They would not make room for him in those hearts that were so straitened by passions, and prejudices, and antipathies.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:11-18 It is wrong for believers to join with the wicked and profane. The word unbeliever applies to all destitute of true faith. True pastors will caution their beloved children in the gospel, not to be unequally yoked. The fatal effects of neglecting Scripture precepts as to marriages clearly appear. Instead of a help meet, the union brings a snare. Those whose cross it is to be unequally united, without their wilful fault, may expect consolation under it; but when believers enter into such unions, against the express warnings of God's word, they must expect must distress. The caution also extends to common conversation. We should not join in friendship and acquaintance with wicked men and unbelievers. Though we cannot wholly avoid seeing and hearing, and being with such, yet we should never choose them for friends. We must not defile ourselves by converse with those who defile themselves with sin. Come out from the workers of iniquity, and separate from their vain and sinful pleasures and pursuits; from all conformity to the corruptions of this present evil world. If it be an envied privilege to be the son or daughter of an earthly prince, who can express the dignity and happiness of being sons and daughters of the Almighty?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye are not straitened in us - That is, you do not possess a narrow or contracted place in our affections. We love you fully, ardently, and are ready to do all that can be done for your welfare. There is no lack of room in our affections toward you. It is not narrow, confined, pent up. It is ample and free.<p>But ye are straitened in your own bowels - That is, in the affections of your hearts. The word used here (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  splangchna) commonly means in the Bible the tender affections. The Greek word properly denotes the upper viscera; the heart, the lungs, the liver. It is applied by Greek writers to denote those parts of victims which were eaten during or after the sacrifice - Robinson (Lexicon). Hence, it is applied to the heart, as the seat of the emotions and passions; and especially the gentler emotions, the tender affections, compassion, pity, love, etc. Our word "bowels" is applied usually to the lower viscera, and by no means expresses the idea of the word which is used in Greek. The idea here is, that they were straitened, or were confined in their affections for him. It is the language of reproof, meaning that he had not received from them the demonstrations of attachment which he had a right to expect, and which was a fair and proportionate return for the love bestowed on them. Probably he refers to the fact that they had formed parties; had admitted false teachers; and had not received his instructions as implicitly and as kindly as they ought to have done. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The meaning of it is: “<span class="ital">valde vos amo, non item vos me</span>.” It is impossible, on account of the <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>, to take it as an <span class="ital">imperative</span> (Aretius, Luther, Heumann, Morus, Schleusner).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ στενοχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμῖν</span>] <span class="ital">non angusto spatio premimini in animis nostris</span>: in this Paul retains the figure of the previous <span class="greekheb">ἡ καρδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πεπλάτ</span>.

The negative expression is an affectionate, pathetic litotes, to be followed by an equally affectionate paternal reproof. This is explanation enough, and dispenses with the hypothesis that Paul is referring to the opinion of the church, that it had too narrow a space—a smaller place than it wished—in his heart (Hofmann).

Elsner, Estius, Wolf, Zachariae, Schrader; comp. also Luther),—a thought, however, which is foreign to the whole connection; hence Flatt also assumes that Paul has <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a> ff. already in his thoughts; and Schrader explains <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2 Corinthians 6:14</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a> as an interpolation.[249]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">στενοχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δὲ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σπλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>.] <span class="ital">so that there is in them no right place for us</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>). Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">οὐκ εἶπεν</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὐ φιλεῖτε ἡμᾶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὐ μετὰ τοῦ αὐτοῦ μέτρου</span>. Paul did not write <span class="greekheb">στενοχωρούμεθα δὲ ἡμεῖς ἐν τοῖς σπλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμ</span>., because by this the contrast would have passed from the thing to the persons (for he had not, in fact, written <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὑμεῖς στενοχωρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμῖν</span>), and so the passage would have lost in fitting concert and sharp force. Rückert thinks that Paul refers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.">2 Corinthians 6:12</a> to an utterance of the Corinthians, who had said: <span class="greekheb">στενωχορούμεθα ἐν αὐτῷ</span>! meaning, <span class="ital">we are perplexed at him</span>, and that now he explains to them how the matter stood with this <span class="greekheb">στενοχωρεῖσθαι</span>, but takes the word in another sense than they themselves had done. A strangely arbitrary view, since the use of the <span class="greekheb">στενοχωρεῖσθαι</span> in our passage was occasioned very naturally and completely by the previous <span class="greekheb">πεπλάτ</span>. Comp. Chrysostom, Theodoret.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[249] Emmerling explains this section <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2 Corinthians 6:14</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a> to be, not an interpolation, but a disturbing addition, only inserted by Paul on reading over the Epistle again, “<span class="ital">sententiis subito in animo exortis</span>.” And recently Ewald has explained it as an inserted fragment from another Epistle, proceeding probably only from some apostolic man, to a Gentile Christian church. But (1) the apparent want of fitting in to the connection, even if it did exist (but see on ver. 14), would least of all warrant this view in the case of an Epistle written under so lively emotion. (2) The contents are quite Pauline, and sufficiently ingenious. (3) The name <span class="greekheb">βελίαρ</span>, which does not occur elsewhere in Scripture, is not evidence against Paul, since in his Epistles (the Pastoral ones excepted) even the name <span class="greekheb">διάβολος</span>, so current elsewhere, occurs only at two passages of the Epistle to the Ephesians. Besides, the <span class="greekheb">συμφών</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χριστῷ πρὸς βελίαρ</span> may be an echo of some apocryphal utterance known to the readers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a>). (4) The expressions <span class="greekheb">μετοχή</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">μετέχειν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Or said he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that plows should plow in hope; and that he that threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope.">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>, <span class="ital">al</span>.), <span class="greekheb">μερές</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>), <span class="greekheb">συμφώνησις</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">σύμφωνος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>), <span class="greekheb">καθαρίζα</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a>), cannot, any more than <span class="greekheb">συγκατάθεσις</span> which he does not use elsewhere, excite well-grounded suspicion in the case of one so rich in handling the language. (5) The critical evidence gives not the slightest trace of ground for assuming that the section did not originally stand in all the manuscripts. How different it is with passages really interpolated, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-9.htm" title="Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.">Mark 16:9</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-33.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.">John 7:33</a> ff.!
