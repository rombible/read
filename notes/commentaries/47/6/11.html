The rush of thoughts had reached its highest point. He rests, and feels almost as if some apology were needed for so vehement an outpouring of emotion. And now he writes as if personally pleading with them. Nowhere else in the whole range of his Epistles do we find any parallel to this form of speech—this “O ye Corinthians.” He has to tell them that he speaks out of the fulness of his heart, that if his mouth has been opened with an unusual freedom it is because his heart has felt a more than common expansion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged....">2 Corinthians 6:11-13</a>. </span>From the praise of the Christian ministry, which he began chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>, he now draws his affectionate exhortation. <span class="ital">O ye Corinthians</span> — He seldom uses this appellation; but it has here a peculiar force. <span class="ital">Our mouth is opened unto you </span>— With uncommon freedom, because <span class="ital">our heart is enlarged </span>— In tenderness, which neither words nor tears can sufficiently express. <span class="ital">Ye are not straitened in us </span>— Our heart is wide enough to receive you all; and all that we can do for your comfort and happiness ye may safely promise yourselves. <span class="ital">But ye are straitened in your own bowels </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Your hearts are contracted and shut up, and so not capable of receiving the blessings ye might enjoy. <span class="ital">Now, for a recompense of the same </span>— Of my paternal tenderness; (<span class="ital">I speak as to my children </span>— I ask nothing hard or grievous;) <span class="ital">be ye also enlarged </span>— Open your hearts first to God, and then to us, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-5.htm" title="And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.">2 Corinthians 8:5</a>,) that God may <span class="ital">dwell in you, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>,) and that ye may <span class="ital">receive us, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:11-18 It is wrong for believers to join with the wicked and profane. The word unbeliever applies to all destitute of true faith. True pastors will caution their beloved children in the gospel, not to be unequally yoked. The fatal effects of neglecting Scripture precepts as to marriages clearly appear. Instead of a help meet, the union brings a snare. Those whose cross it is to be unequally united, without their wilful fault, may expect consolation under it; but when believers enter into such unions, against the express warnings of God's word, they must expect must distress. The caution also extends to common conversation. We should not join in friendship and acquaintance with wicked men and unbelievers. Though we cannot wholly avoid seeing and hearing, and being with such, yet we should never choose them for friends. We must not defile ourselves by converse with those who defile themselves with sin. Come out from the workers of iniquity, and separate from their vain and sinful pleasures and pursuits; from all conformity to the corruptions of this present evil world. If it be an envied privilege to be the son or daughter of an earthly prince, who can express the dignity and happiness of being sons and daughters of the Almighty?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you - We speak freely, and fully. This is an affectionate address to them, and has reference to what he had just said. It means that, when the heart was full on the subject, words would flow freely, and that he had given vent to the fervid language which he had just used because his heart was full. He loved them; he felt deeply; and he spoke to them with the utmost freedom of what he had thought, and purposed, and done.<p>Our heart is enlarged - We have deep feelings, which naturally vent themselves in fervent and glowing language. The main idea here is, that he had a strong affection for them; a heart which embraced and loved them all, and which expressed itself in the language of deep emotion. He had loved them so that he was willing to be reproached, and to be persecuted, and to be poor, and to have his name cast out as evil. "I cannot be silent. I conceal or dissemble nothing. I am full of ardent attachment, and that naturally vents itself in the strong language which I have used." True attachment will find means of expressing itself. A heart full of love will give vent to its feelings. There will be no dissembling and hypocrisy there. And if a minister loves the souls of his people he will pour out the affections of his heart in strong and glowing language. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. mouth &#8230; open unto you&#8212;I use no concealment, such as some at Corinth have insinuated (2Co 4:2). I use all freedom and openness of speech to you as to beloved friends. Hence he introduces here, "O Corinthians" (compare Php 4:15). The enlargement of his heart towards them (2Co 7:3) produced his openness of mouth, that is, his unreserved expression of his inmost feelings. As an unloving man is narrow in heart, so the apostle's heart is enlarged by love, so as to take in his converts at Corinth, not only with their graces, but with their many shortcomings (compare 1Ki 4:29; Ps 119:32; Isa 60:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Our mouth is open</span> to speak freely to you, and to communicate to you the whole will and counsel of God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">our heart is enlarged</span> both by the love that I have towards you, and by the rejoicing that I have in you.

The apostle having exhorted the ministers of the church at Corinth to take care of their ministry, that they fulfil it, and that it might appear that the Gospel, and gifts fitting them to preach it, were not received in vain by them; all which he strengthens and encourages by his own example; and that of others, addresses the members of the church in a very pathetic manner, saying, <p>our mouth is open to you; to speak our minds freely to you; we shall hide and conceal nothing from you, we shall deal with you with all plainness and faithfulness. This seems to refer unto, and pave the way for what he afterwards says about their unequal fellowship with unbelievers: <p>our heart is enlarged: with love to you, and eager desires after your good; and it is from the abundance of our hearts, and hearty affection for you, that our mouth is open so freely to communicate to you. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> O <i>ye</i> Corinthians, our mouth is <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> open unto you, our heart is enlarged.</span><p>(6) Going about to rebuke them he says first that he deals with them sincerely and with an open and plain heart, and in addition complains that they do not do the same in loving their Father.<p>(g) The opening of the mouth and heart signifies a most earnest affection in him that speaks, as it happens commonly with those that are in some great joy.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2 Corinthians 6:11</a>. <span class="ital">Our mouth stands open towards you, Corinthians; our heart is enlarged</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ στόμα ἡμῶν ἀνέῳγε</span>] This expression is <span class="ital">in itself</span> nothing further than a picturesque representation of the thought: <span class="ital">to begin to speak</span>, or <span class="ital">to speak</span>. See, especially, Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Dissert.</span> II. p. 97, and the remark on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-2.htm" title="And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,">Matthew 5:2</a>. A <span class="ital">qualitative</span> definition may be added simply <span class="ital">through the context</span>, as is the case also here partly through the general character of the previous passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:...">2 Corinthians 6:3-10</a>, which is a very open, unreserved utterance, partly by means of the parallel <span class="greekheb">ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν πεπλάτυνται</span>. Thus in accordance with the context <span class="ital">the opposite of reserve</span> is here expressed. Comp. Chrysostom 1. Had Paul merely written <span class="greekheb">λελαλήκαμεν ὑμῖν</span>, the same thought would, in virtue of the context, have been implied in it (we have not been reserved, but have let ourselves be openly heard towards you); but the picturesque <span class="greekheb">τὸ στόμα ἡμῶν ἀνέῳγε</span> is better fitted to convey this meaning, and is therefore <span class="ital">purposely chosen</span>. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-22.htm" title="Now the hand of the LORD was on me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.">Ezekiel 33:22</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/22-22.htm" title="If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not; for there may be a reconciliation: except for upbraiding, or pride, or disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for for these things every friend will depart.">Sir 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm" title="And for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,">Ephesians 6:19</a>; Aeschylus, <span class="ital">Prometh</span>. 612. This at the same time in opposition to Fritzsche, who adheres to the simple <span class="ital">haec ad vos locutus sum</span>, as to which, we may remark, the <span class="ital">haec</span> is imported. Rückert (comp. Chrysostom 2) finds the sense to be: “<span class="ital">see, I have begun to speak with you once, I have not concealed … from you my apostolic sentiments; I cannot yet close my mouth, I must speak with you yet further</span>.” But the thought: <span class="ital">I must speak with you yet further</span>, is imported; how could the reader conjecture it from the simple perfect? Just as little is it to be assumed, with Hofmann, that Paul wishes only to state that he had not been reserved with what he had to say, so that this expression is only <span class="ital">a resumption</span> of the <span class="greekheb">παρακαλοῦμεν μὴ εἰς κενὸν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="ital">in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain.">2 Corinthians 6:1</a></span>.

The figurative expression needed no elucidation from the Hebrew, and least suitable of all is the comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;">Deuteronomy 11:16</a> (Hofmann), where the figurative meaning of <span class="greekheb">יפתה</span> is of quite another kind. See, however, the passages in Wetstein on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The two parts of the verse stand side by side as parallels without a connective particle (<span class="greekheb">καί</span>), in order that thus the second thought, which outweighs the first, might come into more prominent relief,—a relation which is indicated by the emphatic prefixing of <span class="greekheb">τὸ στόμα</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἡ καρδία</span>. The meaning accordingly is: We have (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:...">2 Corinthians 6:3-10</a>) spoken openly to you, Corinthians; our heart has therein become right wide in love towards you—which, however, may not be interpreted of readiness to receive the readers (Hofmann), for they are already in his heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-3.htm" title="I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die and live with you.">2 Corinthians 7:3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>). The relation of the two clauses is taken differently by Emmerling, who inserts a because between them, and by Fritzsche, who says: “quod vobis dixi ejusmodi est, ut inde me vos amare appareat.” But it may be urged against both that we are not justified in taking the two perfects as different in temporal import, the one as a real praeterite, and the other with the force of a present. In <span class="greekheb">πεπλάτυνται</span> it is rather implied that Paul has felt his love to the Corinthians strengthened, his heart towards them widened, during his writing of the passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:...">2 Corinthians 6:3-10</a> (by its contents)—a result, after such an outpouring, intelligible enough, psychologically true, and turned to account in order to move his readers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2 Corinthians 6:11</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>.

Robertson observes here, “Now what makes this remark wonderful in the Apostle’s mouth is that St Paul had received a multitude of provocations from the Corinthians.
