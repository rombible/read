Of “imprisonment?,” that at Philippi is, so far, the only recorded instance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm" title="Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.">Acts 16:24</a>); but there may well have been others, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.">2Corinthians 11:23</a>. “Tumults” (the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-9.htm" title="But when you shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.">Luke 21:9</a>) at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.">Acts 13:50</a>), Lystra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/14-5.htm" title="And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them spitefully, and to stone them,">Acts 14:5-19</a>), Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>), Corinth itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>), and Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23-41</a>). “Labours” describe the usual tenor of his life, the daily work of his calling as a tent-maker, as well as that connected with his ministry. “Watchings” and “fastings” are, probably, both of them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm" title="In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.">2Corinthians 11:27</a>) to be referred to voluntary acts—nights of vigil and self-imposed abstinence—rather than to privations incidental to his work.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears. The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In stripes - In this verse, Paul proceeds to specifications of what he had been called to endure. In the previous verse, he had spoken of his afflictions in general terms. In this expression, he refers to the fact that he and his fellow-laborers were scourged in the synagogues and cities as if they had been the worst of people. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-25</a>, Paul says that he had been scourged five times by the Jews, and had been thrice beaten with rods. See the notes on that place.<p>In imprisonments - As at Philippi; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a> ff. It was no uncommon thing for the early preachers of Christianity to be imprisoned.<p>In tumults - Margin, "Tossing to and fro." The Greek word (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  akatastasia) denotes properly "instability," thence disorder, tumult, commotion. Here it means that in the various tumults and commotions which were produced by the preaching of the gospel, Paul endeavored to act as became a minister of God. Such tumults were excited at Corinth Act 18:6; at Philippi <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19-20</a>; at Lystra and Derbe <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>; at Ephesus <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>, and in various other places. The idea is, that if the ministers of religion are assailed by a lawless mob, they are to endeavor to show the spirit of Christ there, and to evince all patience, and to do good even in such a scene. Patience and the Christian spirit may often do more good in such scenes than much preaching would do elsewhere.<p>In labors - Referring probably to the labors of the ministry, and its incessant duties, and perhaps also to the labors which they performed for their own support, as it is well known that Paul and probably also the other apostles, labored often to support themselves.<p>In watchings - In wakefulness, or lack of sleep. He probably refers to the fact that in these arduous duties, and in his travels, and in anxious cares for the churches, and for the advancement of religion, he was often deprived of his ordinary rest. He refers to this again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>.<p>In fastings - Referring probably not only to the somewhat frequent fasts to which he voluntarily submitted as acts of devotion, but also to the fact that in his travels, when abroad and among strangers, he was often destitute of food. To such trials, those who traveled as Paul did, among strangers, and without property, would be often compelled to submit; and such trials, almost without number, the religion which we now enjoy has cost. It at first cost the painful life, the toils, the anxieties, and the sufferings of the Redeemer; and it has been propagated and perpetuated amidst the deep sorrows, the sacrifices, and the tears and blood of those who have contributed to perpetuate it on earth. For such a religion, originated, extended, and preserved in such a manner, we can never express suitable gratitude to God. Such a religion we cannot overestimate in value; and for the extension and perpetuity of such a religion, we also should be willing to practice unwearied self denial. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. stripes&#8212;(2Co 11:23, 24; Ac 16:23).<p>imprisonments&#8212;(2Co 11:23).

Sleepless nights.<p>fastings&#8212;The context here refers to his trials, rather than devotional exercises (compare 2Co 11:27). Thus "foodlessness" would seem to be the sense (compare 1Co 4:11; Php 4:12). But the usual sense of the Greek is fasts, in the strict sense; and in 2Co 11:27 it is spoken of independently of "hunger and thirst." (Compare Lu 2:37; Ac 10:30; 14:23). However, Mt 15:32; Mr 8:3, justify the sense, more favored by the context, foodlessness, though a rare use of the word.

The stripes were of two kinds - from Jewish whips and Roman rods. But of the five scourgings with Jewish whips not one is mentioned in the Acts, and only one of the three scourgings with Roman rods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>). Nothing, therefore, is more clear than that the Acts only furnishes us with a fragmentary and incomplete record, in which, as we gather from the Epistles, either the agonies of St. Paul's lifelong martyrdom are for some reason intentionally minimized, or else (which is, perhaps, mere probable) St. Paul was, as his rule and habit, so reticent about his own sufferings in the cause of Christ that St. Luke was only vaguely, if at all, aware of many scenes of trial through which he had passed. <span class="cmt_word">In imprisonments.</span> St. Paul was frequently in prison, but St. Luke only tells us of one of these occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>) - at Philippi; the Roman imprisonment and that at Caesarea were <span class="accented">subsequent</span> to this Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">In tumults.</span> These were a normal incident of St. Paul's life, both up to this time and for years afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-28.htm">Acts 19:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-9.htm">Acts 23:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-42.htm">Acts 27:42</a>, etc.) The word <span class="accented">akatastasiai</span> might also mean "insecurities," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> homelessness, wanderings, uncertainties (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11</a>); but New Testament usage seems decisive in favour of the frowner meaning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>).

Hence he again refers to this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>. His "sleeplessness" was sometimes the necessary result of labours "night and day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">In fastings.</span> St. Paul never inculcates the practice of voluntary fasting as a duty (for the reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a> is more than dubious); but it is probable that he found it personally useful at times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-9.htm">Acts 9:9</a>).

This is one of the words which show the influence of political changes. From the original meaning of unsettledness, it developed, through the complications in Greece and in the East after the death of Alexander, into the sense which it has in Luke - political instability. One of the Greek translators of the Old Testament uses it in the sense of dread or anxious care.<p>Watchings (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>.
