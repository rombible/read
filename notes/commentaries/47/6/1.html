The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We then, as workers together with him - On the meaning of this expression, see the note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>. The Greek here is (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  sunergountes) "working together," and may mean either that the apostles and ministers to whom Paul refers were joint-laborers in entreating them not to receive the grace of God in vain; or it may mean that they cooperated with God, or were engaged with him in endeavoring to secure the reconciliation of the world to himself. Tyndale renders it: "we as helpers." Doddridge, "we then as the joint-laborers of God." Most expositors have concurred in this interpretation. The word properly means, to work together; to cooperate in producing any result. Macknight supposes that the word here is in the vocative, and is an address to the fellow-laborers of Paul, entreating them not to receive the grace of God in vain. In this opinion he is probably alone, and has manifestly departed from the scope and design of the passage. Probably the most obvious meaning is that of our translators, who regard it as teaching that Paul was a joint-worker with God in securing the salvation of people.<p>That ye receive not the grace of God in vain - The "grace of God" here means evidently the gracious offer of reconciliation and pardon. And the sense is, "We entreat you not to neglect or slight this offer of pardon, so as to lose the benefit of it, and be lost. It is offered freely and fully. It may be partaken of by all, and all may be saved. But it may also be slighted, and all the benefits of it will then be lost." The sense is, that it was possible that this offer might be made to them, they might hear of a Saviour, be told of the plan of reconciliation and have the offers of mercy pressed on their attention and acceptance, and yet all be in vain. They might notwithstanding all this be lost, for simply to hear of the plan of salvation or the offers of mercy, will no more save a sinner than to hear of medicine will save the sick. It must be embraced and applied, or it will be in vain. It is true that Paul probably addressed this to those who were professors of religion; and the sense is, that they should use all possible care and anxiety lest these offers should have been made in vain. They should examine their own hearts; they should inquire into their own condition; they should guard against self-deception. The same persons <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a> Paul had exhorted also to be reconciled to God; and the idea is, that he would earnestly entreat even professors of religion to give all diligence to secure an interest in the saving mercy of the gospel, and to guard against the possibility of being self-deceived and ruined. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>2Co 6:1-18.

Though the internal work be his alone, and the effects of his Spirit upon the souls of those whose hearts are changed; yet there is a ministerial part, which lieth in exhortation and argument, by the ear conveyed to the soul; thus ministers work together with Christ. And without him they can do nothing: they are workers, but they must have Christ work with them, or they will find that they labour in vain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:</span> grace signifieth any free gift; and it is in the New Testament variously applied; but here it signifies, the doctrine of the gospel, held forth in the preaching of it, which these Corinthians had received with the ears of their bodies. And this was Paul’s, and should be every godly minister’s, work, not with roughness, but with all mildness and gentleness, to beseech those to whom they preach the gospel, that they would believe and embrace it, and live up to the holy rules of it; without which, (as to their souls’ benefit), all the kindness of God, in affording them the gospel and means of grace, is in vain, and lost: though God yet hath his end, and his ministers shall he <span class="ital">a sweet savour to God, </span> as well with, reference to them that perish, as those who shall be saved.

The ministers of the Gospel are workers or labourers; their ministry is a work, and a very laborious one, which none have strength equal to, and are sufficient for; of themselves: it is a work that requires faithfulness and diligence, is honourable; and those who perform it aright deserve respect. These do not work alone: according to our version, they are "workers together with him"; meaning either God or Christ, not as co-ordinate with him, but as subordinate to him: he is the chief shepherd, they under ones; he is the chief master builder, they under workers; but inasmuch as he is with them, and they with him, he is over them, and stands by them, great honour is done them; they have encouragement to work; and hence it is that their work is successful. Though the phrase, "with him", is not in the original text, where only one word,  is used, and may be rendered "fellow workers", or "fellow labourers", meaning with one another: and since therefore reconciliation was made by Christ, and the ministry of it was committed to them, and they were appointed ambassadors for him, and were in his stead, therefore, say they, <p>we beseech you also; you ministers also; as we have entreated the members of the church, to be reconciled to the order of the Gospel, and the laws of Christ in his house, so as fellow labourers with you, and jointly concerned in the same embassy of peace, we beseech you the ministers of the word in this church, <p>that ye receive not the grace of God in vain: by "the grace of God", is not meant the grace of God in regeneration, and effectual calling, which can never be received in vain; for the grace of God never fails of producing a thorough work of conversion; nor is it ever lost, but is strictly connected with eternal, glory: but by it is meant either the doctrine of grace, the Gospel of Christ, so called, because it is a declaration of the love and grace of God to sinners, ascribes salvation in part, and in whole, to the free grace of God, and is a means of implanting and increasing grace in the hearts of men. Now this may be received in vain by ministers and people, when it is but notionally received, or received in word only: when it is abused and perverted to vile purposes, and when men drop, deny it, and fall off from it; or else by the grace of God may be designed gifts of grace, qualifying for ministerial service; and the sense of the exhortation be, that they be careful that the gifts bestowed on them might not be neglected by them, but be used and improved to the advantage of the church, and the glory of Christ; by giving up themselves to study, meditation, and prayer, by labouring constantly in the word and doctrine, and by having a strict regard to their lives and conversations, "that the ministry be not blamed"; which exhortation he pursues in, and by his own example and others, in some following verses, the next being included in a "parenthesis". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">We <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> then, <i>as</i> workers together <i>with him</i>, beseech <i>you</i> also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</span><p>(1) Men do not only need the ministry of the Gospel before they have received grace, in order that they may be partakers of the Gospel, but also after they have received grace they need to continue in it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain.">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>. <span class="ital">Connection and meaning:</span> “We do not, however, let the matter rest merely with that entreaty on Christ’s behalf: <span class="ital">be ye reconciled to God</span>, but, <span class="ital">since we are His fellow-workers</span>, and there is thus more laid on us to do than that entreaty on Christ’s behalf, <span class="ital">we also exhort that ye lose not again the grace of God which you have received</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), that <span class="ital">ye do not frustrate it in your case by an unchristian life</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συνεργοῦντες</span>] The <span class="greekheb">συν</span> finds its contextual reference not in the subject of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, where there is only an auxiliary clause assigning a reason, nor yet in <span class="greekheb">ὡς τοῦ θεοῦ παρακαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἡμῶν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm" title="Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be you reconciled to God.">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>, in which there was given only a modal definition of the <span class="greekheb">πρεσβεύειν ὑπὲρ Χ</span>., but in <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ Χριστοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm" title="Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be you reconciled to God.">2 Corinthians 5:20</a> : <span class="ital">as working together with Christ</span>.
