His enemies were compelled to admit this as far as his life at Corinth was concerned; but they had detected what they looked on as a grave inconsistency. He had accepted help from the churches of Macedonia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>), and in this they found ground for a two-fold charge: “He wasn’t above taking money from other churches—he was only too proud to take it from that of Corinth;” and this was made matter of personal offence. To take money at all was mean; not to take it from them was contemptuous.<p>He does not deny the facts. He repeats the irritating epithet, <span class= "ital">“</span>abasing myself”; he adds the familiar antithesis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-12.htm" title="And whoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.">Matthew 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-52.htm" title="He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.">Luke 1:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-11.htm" title="For whoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11</a>), “Yes, but I did it that you might be exalted,” perhaps with reference to elevation in spiritual knowledge, perhaps, because the fact that he laboured for them without payment was the greatest proof of disinterested love for them which could be given.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?...">2 Corinthians 11:7-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Have I committed an offence </span>— Will any turn this into an objection; <span class="ital">in abasing myself — </span>Stooping to work at my trade; <span class="ital">that ye</span> <span class="ital">might be exalted </span>— To the dignity of being the children of God; <span class="ital">because I have preached the gospel to you </span>free of expense. “This the apostle’s enemies said was a presumption, that he knew himself to be no apostle; or, if he was an apostle, it showed that he did not love the Corinthians. The first of these objections he had answered in his former epistle, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-3.htm" title="My answer to them that do examine me is this,...">1 Corinthians 9:3-19</a>,) by proving his right to a maintenance, and by declaring that he declined using that right, merely to make his preaching the more acceptable and successful. The second objection he answers in this chapter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-11.htm" title="Why? because I love you not? God knows....">2 Corinthians 11:11-15</a>.” <span class="ital">I robbed </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εσολησα</span>, <span class="ital">I spoiled, </span>as it were, <span class="ital">other churches </span>— (It is a military term;) <span class="ital">taking wages </span>— <span class="greekheb">Οψωνιον</span>, <span class="ital">pay, </span>(another military word,) <span class="ital">of them, </span>when I first came to you; <span class="ital">to do you service </span>— To serve your best interests by converting you to, and instructing you in, the faith of the gospel. It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only....">Php 4:15-16</a>, that it was from the church at Philippi that he received the support here spoken of. For the brethren there, “being strongly impressed with a sense of the advantages which mankind derived from the gospel, were so anxious to render the apostle’s preaching in Corinth successful, that, during his residence there, they sent him money, to prevent his being burdensome to the Corinthians. His acceptance of these presents he called <span class="ital">a spoiling </span>of the Philippians, because, as he was not labouring among them, he took their money without giving them any thing in return for it; and <span class="ital">a taking of wages: </span>but it was for a service performed, not to the Philippians, but to the Corinthians.” <span class="ital">And when I was present with you and wanted </span>— The gains of my labour not quite supplying my necessities; <span class="ital">I was chargeable to no man </span>— Of your church, or of Corinth. The word here used, <span class="greekheb">κατεναρκησα</span>, appears to be derived from <span class="greekheb">ναρκη</span>, which, Elian says, is the name of a fish, called by the Latins <span class="ital">torpedo, </span>because it deprives those who touch it of the sense of feeling. According to this derivation of the word, the apostle’s meaning is, <span class="ital">I benumbed, </span>or <span class="ital">oppressed, </span>or hurt, <span class="ital">no one. </span>See the notes of Joach. Camerar. <span class="ital">For what was lacking </span>— For my support; <span class="ital">the brethren from Macedonia supplied </span>— Though it seems the apostle generally maintained himself by his own labour, he was sometimes so occupied in preaching, and in the other functions of his ministry, that he had little time for working. This was the case when he was first at Corinth, at which time the Philippians relieved him. For he chose to receive help from the poor of that place, rather than from the rich Corinthians. <span class="ital">In all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you </span>— In any way whatever; <span class="ital">and will keep myself </span>— So long as God shall enable me. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:5-15 It is far better to be plain in speech, yet walking openly and consistently with the gospel, than to be admired by thousands, and be lifted up in pride, so as to disgrace the gospel by evil tempers and unholy lives. The apostle would not give room for any to accuse him of worldly designs in preaching the gospel, that others who opposed him at Corinth, might not in this respect gain advantage against him. Hypocrisy may be looked for, especially when we consider the great power which Satan, who rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience, has upon the minds of many. And as there are temptations to evil conduct, so there is equal danger on the other side. It serves Satan's purposes as well, to set up good works against the atonement of Christ, and salvation by faith and grace. But the end will discover those who are deceitful workers; their work will end in ruin. Satan will allow his ministers to preach either the law or the gospel separately; but the law as established by faith in Christ's righteousness and atonement, and the partaking of his Spirit, is the test of every false system.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have I committed an offence - Have I done wrong. Greek, "Have I committed a sin." There is here a somewhat abrupt transition from the previous verse; and the connection is not very apparent. Perhaps the connection is this. "I admit my inferiority in regard to my manner of speaking. But this does not interfere with my full understanding of the doctrines which I preach, nor does it interfere with the numerous evidences which I have furnished that I am called to the office of an apostle. What then is the ground of offence? In what have I erred? Wherein have I shown that I was not qualified to be an apostle? Is it in the fact that I have not chosen to press my claim to a support, but have preached the gospel without charge?" There can be no doubt that they urged this as an objection to him, and as a proof that he was conscious that he had no claim to the office of an apostle; see the notes on 1Co. 9:3-18. Paul here answers this charge; and the sum of his reply is, that he had received a support, but that it had come from others, a support which they had furnished because the Corinthians had neglected to do it.<p>In abasing myself - By laboring with my own hands; by submitting to voluntary poverty, and by neglecting to urge my reasonable claims for a support.<p>That ye might be exalted - In spiritual blessings and comforts. I did it because I could thus better promote religion among you. I could thus avoid the charge of aiming at the acquisition of wealth; could shut the mouths of gainsayers, and could more easily secure access to you. Is it now to be seriously urged as a fault that I have sought your welfare, and that in doing it I have submitted to great self-denial and to many hardships?

Either by behaving among them, when he was first with them, in a very modest and humble manner, in much fear and trembling, without pride and haughtiness, or affectation of power and authority over them; or by using a popular style, suited to the capacity of the common people; or by labouring with his own hands, exercising his trade of tent making among them, that he might provide food for himself, and not be chargeable to them; and which he suggests was so far from being criminal in him, that he ought rather to be commended for it; since it could not be thought to be with any view to himself, and his own advantage, but purely for their good: <p>that you might be exalted; that nothing might lie in their way of receiving the Gospel of Christ, or prejudice them against it; that they might the more easily be brought to listen to it, come to the knowledge of it, and embrace it, and so be exalted, as they were, to a participation of the grace of Christ; to fellowship with him; to the honour and dignity of being a church of Christ; to an enjoyment of the privileges of God's house; to have a name better than that of sons and daughters, and to have a right and title to the heavenly glory: "because", or is it <p>because I have preached to you the Gospel of God freely? The Gospel he preached was not his own, but God's; of which he was the author; his grace was the subject of it, and his glory the end of its ministration; which he had given to the apostle to preach; to which he had separated him, for which he had abundantly qualified him, and in which he was greatly succeeded by him. This he preached "freely" to the Corinthians at his first coming among them, without putting them to any expense, or receiving anything from them; which though he might lawfully have done, yet he judged it most advisable, at that time, to minister to his own necessities, by working with his hands, lest he should be burdensome to them; and this be an objection to the Gospel he preached, that he sought rather theirs than them; and for so doing he was not to be blamed, but to be praised: and yet such was the weakness of many at least in this church, that they highly valued the false apostles, who made merchandise of them, and treated with contempt this excellent servant of Christ, who had freely imparted the Gospel to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</span><p>(4) Another slander, that is, that he was a rascal, and lived by the labour of his own hands.
