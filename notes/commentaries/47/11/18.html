As if he had said, Being such very wise men, I hope you will bear with this piece of folly in me as you bear with it in others. This is written in the highest strain of ridicule, as is plain from the next verse, where, in mockery, he mentions their abjectly bearing the contumelious and injurious behaviour of the false teachers, as an example of their wisdom in bearing. But it was a bearing, not with fools, but with knaves, to their own cost. By taking notice of that circumstance, therefore, the apostle placed their pretended wisdom in a truly ridiculous light. <span class="ital">For, </span>&c. — Your patience in bearing is indeed very great; <span class="ital">for ye</span> <span class="ital">suffer </span>— Not only the folly, but the gross abuses of those false teachers; ye take it patiently <span class="ital">if a man </span>— Any of the false teachers; <span class="ital">bring you into bondage </span>— Lord it over you in the most arbitrary manner. <span class="ital">If a man devour you </span>— By his exorbitant demands, notwithstanding his boast of not being burdensome; <span class="ital">if he take of you </span>— Gifts and presents, pretending to exact nothing as due; <span class="ital">if </span>he <span class="ital">exalt himself </span>— By the most unbounded self- commendation; <span class="ital">if </span>he <span class="ital">smite you on the face </span>— Treat you as disgracefully as if he did so. <span class="ital">I speak </span>— What I have now said; <span class="ital">concerning reproach </span>— Namely, the reproach which they cast upon you Gentiles as uncircumcised and profane, while they are all of a holy nation: or, I mean it of those reproaches with which they load me and my fellow-labourers; <span class="ital">as though we had been weak </span>— Or contemptible, in comparison of them, and could have used no such authority over you. <span class="ital">Howbeit, whereinsoever any is bold — </span>Thinks he may value and extol himself; (<span class="ital">I speak foolishly </span>— That is, in appearance;) <span class="ital">I am bold also </span>— I have as much to say for myself, as he has for himself.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:16-21 It is the duty and practice of Christians to humble themselves, in obedience to the command and example of the Lord; yet prudence must direct in what it is needful to do things which we may do lawfully, even the speaking of what God has wrought for us, and in us, and by us.

His endowments "in the flesh," or what he had to boast of pertaining to the flesh, related not so much to birth and rank, though not inferior to them in these, but to what the flesh had endured - to stripes and imprisonments, and hunger and peril.

Or with respect to things external, such as their high birth and parentage, carnal descent, circumcision, learned education, and the like; of which the false apostles, being Jews, boasted, who it seems were many; and though a multitude is not to be followed to do evil, yet the apostle thought, that since there were so many who were indulged by this church in this way, he might be allowed to boast also of such like things, so far as he could with truth and a good conscience, and in order to secure some valuable ends: <p>I will glory also; for he was of the seed of Abraham as well as they, of the stock of Israel, and tribe of Benjamin, circumcised the eighth day, and brought up at the feet of Gamaliel; but these are not all the things he could, and would, and did glory of; he gloried of these, and of others besides them, which the false apostles could not, and thereby proved himself to be superior to them, even in external things, of which they bragged so much. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.">2 Corinthians 11:18</a>.

Rückert: “according to the impulse of self-seeking personality;” also de Wette, Ewald, Neander.

But it necessarily follows, as well from the previous <span class="greekheb">οὐ λαλῶ κατὰ κύριον</span>, in which the <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σάρκα</span> is already expressed <span class="ital">implicite</span>, as also from the following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ ἈΦΡΌΝΩΝ</span></span></span>, among whom Paul is included as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ ΤῊΝ ΣΆΡΚΑ ΚΑΥΧΏΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span>. It is otherwise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-15.htm" title="You judge after the flesh; I judge no man.">John 8:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[332] To this category belongs also the interpretation of Baur, who, however, refers <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> quite specially to Judaism as what is inherited, and therefore understands a boasting, <span class="ital">the object of which is only inherited accidental advantages</span>. The <span class="greekheb">διάκονοι Χριστοῦ</span>, ver. 23, and the apostle’s subsequent glorying in <span class="ital">suffering</span>, ought to have dissuaded Baur from adopting such a view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[333] Osiander is quite wrong in objecting to this interpretation that the <span class="ital">article</span> is against it, since Paul, when he means <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> in this sense, <span class="ital">never</span> puts the article after <span class="greekheb">κατά</span>. Paul, in fact, has the article only in this <span class="ital">single</span> passage, and elsewhere writes <span class="ital">always</span> <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> (i.e. <span class="ital">conformably to flesh</span>) whether he uses <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> in the subjective or objective sense; hence, so far as the article is concerned, there is no means at all of comparison. Besides, <span class="greekheb">τήν</span> here is very doubtful critically, because it is wanting in D* F G א* min. Chrys. Dam., and is at variance with the Pauline usage. Osiander’s further objection, that <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν σάρκα</span>, as understood by us, is in the apostle’s mouth unworthy of him for the apodosis, is likewise incorrect, for he is speaking ironically; he wishes, in fact, to deal in boasting like a fool! As to the distinction between <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> and <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν σάρκα</span>, we may add that the one means: “after the manner of natural humanity,” the other, “after the manner of their natural humanity.” Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-24.htm" title="Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.">Php 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-22.htm" title="But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.">Php 1:22</a>.
