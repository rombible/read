He has named these acts of outrage, he says, as though by way of self-disparagement. “<span class= "ital">We</span>” (the pronoun is strongly emphasised) “were too infirm to venture on such things.” The taunt flung at his bodily infirmities is still present to his thoughts, and he assumes, in the bitterness of his irony, that it was through them he had been kept from like acts of self-asserting authority. Then he resumes his contrast, still dwelling on the offensive words, “folly” or “insanity,” which had been used of him: “Yes, but on every ground of daring—I know you will see my insanity again in this—I have as much right to dare as they.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:16-21 It is the duty and practice of Christians to humble themselves, in obedience to the command and example of the Lord; yet prudence must direct in what it is needful to do things which we may do lawfully, even the speaking of what God has wrought for us, and in us, and by us. Doubtless here is reference to facts in which the character of the false apostles had been shown. It is astonishing to see how such men bring their followers into bondage, and how they take from them and insult them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I speak as concerning reproach - I speak of disgrace. That is, says Rosenmuller, "I speak of your disgrace, or, as others prefer it, of the disgrace of the false apostles." Doddridge regards it as a question. "Do I speak this by way of dishonor, from an envious desire to derogate from my superiors so as to bring them down to my own level?" But to me it seems that Paul refers to what he had been admitting respecting himself - to what he had evinced in rudeness of speech <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-6.htm">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>, and to his not having urged his claims to the support which an apostle had a right to receive - to things, in short, which they esteemed to be disgraceful or reproachful. And his idea, it seems to me, is this: "I have been speaking of reproach or disgrace as if I was weak, that is, as if I was disposed to admit as true all that has been said of me as reproachful or disgraceful; all that has been said of my lack of qualifications for the office, of my lack of talent, or elevated rank, or honorable birth, etc. I have not pressed my claims, but have been reasoning as if all this were true - as if all that was honorable in birth and elevated in rank belonged to them - all that is mean and unworthy pertained to me. But it is not so. Whatever they have I have. Whatever they can boast of, I can boast of in a more eminent degree. Whatever advantage there is in birth is mine; and I can tell of toils, and trials, and sufferings in the apostolic office which far surpass theirs." Paul proceeds, therefore, to a full statement of his advantages of birth and of his labors in the cause of the Redeemer.<p>As though we had been weak - As if I had no claims to urge; as if I had no just cause of boldness, but must submit to this reproach.<p>Howbeit - (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;  de). But. The sense is, if anyone is disposed to boast, I am ready for him. I can tell also of things that have as high claims to confidence as they can. If they are disposed to go into a comparison on the points which qualify a man for the office of an apostle, I am ready to compare myself with them.<p>Whereinsoever - (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#837;  en ho&#772;. In what. Whatever they have to boast of I am prepared also to show that I am equal to them. Be it pertaining to birth, rank, education, labors, they will find that I do not shrink from the comparison.<p>Any is bold - (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837;  tis tolma). Anyone who dares to boast; anyone who is bold.<p>I speak foolishly - Remember now that I speak as a fool. I have been charged with this folly. Just now keep that in mind; and do not forget that it is only a fool who is speaking. Just recollect that I have no claims to public confidence; that I am destitute of all pretensions to the apostolic office; that I am given to a vain parade and ostentation, and to boasting of what does not belong to me, and when you recollect this let me tell my story. The whole passage is ironical in the highest degree. The sense is, "It is doubtless all nonsense and folly for a man to boast who has only the qualifications which I have. But there is a great deal of wisdom in their boasting who have so much more elevated endowments for the apostolic office."<p>I am bold also - I can meet them on their own ground, and speak of qualifications not inferior to theirs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. as concerning reproach&#8212;rather, "by way of dishonor (that is, self-disparagement) I say it."<p>as though we &#8230; weak&#8212;in not similarly (2Co 11:20) showing our power over you.

These words may be considered either as explanative of the latter part of the former verse, "if a man smite you on the face"; that is not to be understood strictly and literally, of one man's striking another on the face, but of reproach and contumelious language, used by the false apostles to the Corinthians; or they may have reference to the apostle's design in the whole, which was partly to reproach, the Corinthians for acting such a stupid part, in patiently bearing so many and such indignities from these men; and partly to expose the scandalous and reproachful usage of them by the false apostles, that if possible their eyes might be opened to see through them, and discard them: or else these words may be regarded in connection with what follows, <p>as though we had been weak; and then the apostle's meaning is, that as to the business of scandal and reproach he was speaking of, this was not confined to the Corinthians only, but they the true apostles had their share of it; for the false apostles reproached them, as poor, weak, fearful, and pusillanimous men; because they did not use that authority, and exercise that domination over them, they did not bring them into bondage, devour their substance, take away their goods from them by force, insult over them, and treat them in an ignominious and contemptuous manner; and intimated that they were upon all accounts inferior to them, and not worthy to be mentioned with them; which moved the apostle to exert himself, and boldly rise up in his own defence, saying, <p>howbeit, wherein soever any is bold; to boast of his pedigree, character, office, and usefulness, <p>I speak foolishly; as it might seem, and be so interpreted by some, <p>I am bold also; to enter the lists with him, to compare notes, and see on which side the superiority lies; and which is done in the following verses, to the full confutation of all the pride, vanity, blind boasting of the false apostles. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I speak as concerning <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> reproach, as though we had been <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> weak.

The main point in it is, that <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἀτιμίαν</span> denotes something shameful <span class="ital">for the apostle</span>, and <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span> has a <span class="ital">prospective</span> reference. Rückert also gives <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span> a prospective reference, but he diverges in regard to <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἀτιμίαν</span>, and supplies <span class="greekheb">μέν</span>: “<span class="ital">in the point, indeed, to bring disgrace upon you, I must acknowledge that I have been weak</span>.” But in that case how unintelligibly would Paul have expressed himself! For, apart from the arbitrary supplying of <span class="greekheb">μέν</span>, the definite <span class="greekheb">ἀτιμίαν</span> would be quite unsuitable. Paul, to be understood, must have written <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν ἀτιμίαν ὑμῶν</span> (as regards your disgrace), or at least, with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.">2 Corinthians 11:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν ἀτιμίαν</span> (as regards the disgrace under consideration). Ewald and Hofmann take <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀτιμ</span>. rightly, but give <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span> a retrospective reference. In their view of <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὅτι</span> they diverge from one another, Ewald explaining it: <span class="ital">as if I from paternal weakness could not have chastised you myself</span>; Hofmann, on the other hand, taking <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὅτι</span> on as specifying the <span class="ital">reason</span> for saying such a thing (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm" title="To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>). Against Ewald it may be urged that <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὅτι</span> does not mean <span class="ital">as if</span>, and that the five points previously mentioned are not brought under the general notion of <span class="ital">chastisement</span>; and against both expositors, it may be urged that if <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀτιμίαν</span> were in reference to <span class="ital">what precedes</span> to mean a dishonour <span class="ital">of the apostle himself</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> must of necessity (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-11.htm" title="Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatever state I am, therewith to be content.">Php 4:11</a>, <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> is different) have been appended in order to be understood, because the previous points were a shame <span class="ital">of the readers</span>; consequently the fine point would have lain just in an emphatically added <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> (such as <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν ἡμῶν ἀτιμίαν</span>). In our interpretation, on the other hand, <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀτιμίαν</span> receives its definite reference through <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὅτι ἡμεῖς</span> (<span class="ital">that we</span>), and a <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἀτιμίαν</span> would have been quite superfluous. Most of the older commentators, too, though with many variations in detail, refer <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀτιμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span> <span class="ital">to what precedes</span>, but explain <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀτιμ</span>. of the shame of the <span class="ital">readers</span>. So Chrysostom,[334] Theophylact, Theodoret, Pelagius, Erasmus, Beza, Calvin, Hunnius, and others: <span class="ital">to your shame I say this</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.">2 Corinthians 11:20</a>), <span class="ital">as if</span> [rather: <span class="ital">as because</span>] <span class="ital">we had been weak</span>, and could not have done the same thing, although we could do it but would not. Similarly also Billroth (followed by Olshausen): “<span class="ital">In a disgraceful way, I maintain, you put up with that injustice from the alleged reason that we are weak</span>” (rather: <span class="ital">had been</span>). But since <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀτιμ</span>. is not more precisely defined by a <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, we have no right to give to it another definition than it has already received from Paul by the emphatic <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς ἠσθενήσ</span>. Against the retrospective reference of <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span>, see above. Finally, in that view the passage would lose its ironical character, which however still continues, as is shown at once by the following <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀφροσύνῃ λέγω</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ δʼ ἄν τις τολμᾶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Contrast with the ironical <span class="greekheb">ἠσθενήσαμεν</span>: <span class="ital">wherein</span>, however, <span class="ital">any one is bold<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I say it irrationally<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I too am bold</span>; in whatever respect (<span class="ital">quocunque nomine</span>) any one possesses boldness, I too have boldness. In <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> lies the <span class="ital">real ground</span>, in which the <span class="greekheb">τολμᾶν</span> has its causal basis.

He proceeds to correct the ironical admission in the next clause. The meaning can hardly be, "I admit the disgraces I have suffered" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-8.htm">2 Corinthians 6:8</a>), because he is speaking of the Corinthians, not of himself. I am bold also. If they derive their right to this audacious and overweening line of conduct from any privileges of theirs, there is not one of these privileges which I too may not claim. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>As concerning reproach (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Better, Rev., by way of disparagement.
