They were “ministers of Christ” in a nearer and a higher sense than others. This again falls in with all that has been said as to the nature and pretensions of those who said, “I am of Christ.” (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance?

The word “labours” is, of course, too vague to admit of more than a general comparison with the picture of his life presented in the Acts of the Apostles. The more specific statements show us that the writer of that book tends to understate rather than exaggerate the labours and sufferings of the Apostle. It tells us, up to this time, only of one imprisonment, at Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm" title="And when they had laid many stripes on them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:">Acts 16:23</a>), and leaves us to conjecture where and under what circumstances we are to look for the others. In the “deaths oft,” we trace an echo of the “sentence of death,” the “dying daily” (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead:">2Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10</a>); but the words probably include dangers to life of other kinds as well as those arising from bodily disease.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ?

And to show how much he exceeded them in that inferior character, he mentions his labours in the ministry, and his sufferings undergone in his many journeys and voyages, for the sake of spreading the gospel. And from his account it appears, that none of the heroes of antiquity, however vehemently actuated by the love of fame, or of military glory or power, either did or suffered as much in the pursuit of their objects, as the Apostle Paul did and suffered for Christ and his gospel.” <span class="ital">I am more </span>so than they; <span class="ital">in labours more abundant </span>— Sustained for a long series of years; <span class="ital">in stripes above measure </span>— All endured for Christ and his cause. <span class="ital">In prisons more frequent </span>— In the narrative of Paul’s travels and sufferings, contained in the Acts, we only read of his being imprisoned once, before this epistle was written, namely, at Philippi. But doubtless many particulars of his life, besides the imprisonments here referred to, were omitted in that history, for the sake of brevity. <span class="ital">In deaths oft </span>— Surrounding me in the most dreadful forms. <span class="ital">Of the Jews five times received I </span>— In their synagogues, and before their courts of judgment; <span class="ital">forty stripes, save one — </span>According to the law, punishment by stripes was restricted to forty, at one beating, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-3.htm" title="Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>; but the whip with which these stripes were given, consisting of three separate cords, and each stroke being counted as three stripes, thirteen strokes made thirty-nine stripes, beyond which they never went. See Whitby. As the apostle, before his conversion, had been very active in inflicting this punishment on the disciples of Christ, he could not complain when he himself was treated in the same manner by the zealots for the law. <span class="ital">Thrice was I beaten with rods </span>— By the Roman lictors or beadles, at the command of their superior magistrates. In his history, contained in the Acts, we find no mention made of his being punished with stripes, and only one instance occurs there of his being beaten with rods. See the margin. <span class="ital">Once was I stoned </span>— Namely, at Lystra, at which time he was left for dead. <span class="ital">Thrice I suffered shipwreck </span>— Before his voyage to Rome, in which he was shipwrecked at Malta; of these we have no account in the Acts. <span class="ital">A night and a day I have been in the deep </span>— Probably floating on some part of a shipwrecked vessel, by which, possibly, he escaped to shore. This, it is likely, happened in one of the three shipwrecks mentioned in the preceding clause.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:22-33 The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to do and suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein he excelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character and usefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Are they ministers of Christ? - Though Jews by birth yet they claimed to be the ministers of the Messiah.<p>I speak as a fool - As if he had said, "Bear in mind, in what I am now about to say, that he who speaks is accused of being a fool in boasting. Let it not be deemed improper that I should act in this character, and since you regard me as such, let me speak like a fool." His frequent reminding them of this charge was eminently suited to humble them that they had ever made it, especially when they were reminded by an enumeration of his trials, of the character of the man against whom the charge was brought.<p>I am more - Paul was not disposed to deny that they were true ministers of Christ. But he had higher claims to the office than they had. He had been called to it in a more remarkable manner, and he had shown by his labors and trials that he had more of the true spirit of a minister of the Lord Jesus than they had. He therefore goes into detail to show what he had endured in endeavoring to diffuse the knowledge of the Saviour; trials which the had borne probably while they had been dwelling in comparative ease, and in a comfortable manner, free from suffering and persecution.<p>In labors more abundant - In the kind of labor necessary in propagating the gospel. Probably he had now been engaged in the work a much longer time than they had, and had been far more indefatigable in it.<p>In stripes - In receiving stripes; that is, I have been more frequently scourged; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>. This was a proof of his being a minister of Christ, because eminent devotedness to him at that time, of necessity subjected a man to frequent scourging. The ministry is one of the very few places, perhaps it stands alone in this, where it is proof of special qualification for office that a man has been treated with all manner of contumely, and has even been often publicly whipped. What other office admits such a qualification as this?<p>Above measure - Exceedingly; far exceeding them. He had received far more than they had, and he judged, therefore, that this was one evidence that he had been called to the ministry.<p>In prisons more frequent - In the Book of Acts , Luke mentions only one imprisonment of Paul before the time when this Epistle was written. That was at Philippi with Silas, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a> ff. But we are to remember that many things were omitted by Luke. He does not profess to give an account of all that happened to Paul; and an omission is not a contradiction. For anything that Luke says, Paul may have been imprisoned often. He mentions his having been in prison once; he does not deny that he had been in prison many times besides; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>.<p>In deaths oft - This is, exposed to death; or suffering pain equal to death; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>. No one familiar with the history of Paul can doubt that he was often in danger of death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

Old authorities read the order thus, "In prisons above measures, in stripes more abundantly" (English Version, less accurately, "more frequent").

But when the Apostle thinks of the singleness of his devotion to Christ’s cause, of which he had so frequently boasted (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/6-4.htm" title="But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,...">2 Corinthians 6:4-10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>, &c.), and of the nature of his services as compared with theirs, his spirit rises within him. ‘I may speak like a madman,’ he cries (see next note), ‘but I cannot contain myself at such a charge. What have <span class="ital">they</span> done for the cause of Him whose name they falsely arrogate to themselves, compared to the services I have rendered?

St Paul is not thinking here so much of the impression his words may produce on the Corinthians, as of the fact that all ‘boasting’ in God’s sight is ‘excluded’ by the ‘law of faith’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm" title="Where is boasting then?

Mad indeed is it to boast of anything as constituting a claim on God for reward. But facts are facts, and they may be appealed to, not for self-glorification, but (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing.">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>) to confute pretensions which ought never to have been advanced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in labours more abundant</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>. He now commences the proof of this assertion, and it consists not in words but in deeds. He appeals to “a life hitherto without precedent in the history of the world. Self-devotion at particular moments, or for some special national cause, had been often seen before; but a self-devotion involving sacrifices like those here described, extending through a period of at least fourteen years, and in behalf of no local or family interest, but for the interest of mankind at large, was up to this time a thing unknown.” Stanley. De Wette would translate <span class="ital">more abundantly</span> (the word is an adverb in the original) and connect it with what has gone before, ‘in labours I am more abundantly a minister of Christ than they.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in prisons more frequent</span>] “What is left out is more than is enumerated.” Chrysostom.

So there is but <span class="ital">one</span> beating with rods (see below). The Acts of the Apostles, being written with a special purpose (see note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-5.htm" title="In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;">2 Corinthians 6:5</a>), does not attempt to give a <span class="ital">full</span> account of St Paul’s labours and sufferings.

It is downright insanity on my part to enter into this contest of rival egotism.

This is the "frantic" boast which he proceeds to justify in a fragment of biography which must ever be accounted as the most remarkable and unique in the world's history. And when St. Paul lived the life was, as Dean Stanley says, "hitherto without precedent in the history of the world." No <span class="accented">subsequent</span> life of saint or martyr has ever surpassed St. Paul's, as here sketched, in self-devotion; and no previous life even remotely resembled it. The figure of the Christian missionary was, until then, unknown. <span class="cmt_word">In labours more abundant;</span> literally, <span class="accented">more abundantly</span>. The best comment is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In stripes above measure.</span> The expression is partly explained in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">In prisons.</span> St. Clement of Rome says that St. Paul was imprisoned seven times. The only imprisonment <span class="accented">up to this date</span> recorded in the Acts is that at Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>). The imprisonments in Jerusalem, Caesarea, and Rome all took place later. He says later," The Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city that bonds and imprisonment await me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In deaths oft.</span> He alludes to the incessant opposition, peril, and anguish which make him say in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>, "I die daily" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-11.htm">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-36.htm">Romans 8:36</a>).

Lit., being beside myself Rev., as one beside myself. This expression is stronger than that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-21.htm">2 Corinthians 11:21</a>, because the statement which it characterizes is stronger. Up to this point Paul has been asserting equality with the other teachers. Now he asserts superiority "I more;" and ironically characterizes this statement from their stand-point as madness.<p>More abundant (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., more abundantly, as Rev.<p>Stripes above measure (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>This peculiar form of suffering is emphasized by details. He specifies three Roman scourgings, and five at the hands of the Jews. Of the former, only one is recorded, that at Philippi (<a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-25.htm">Acts 22:25</a>), and none of the latter. The Jewish scourge consisted of two thongs made of calf's or ass's skin, passing through a hole in a handle. Thirteen blows were inflicted on the breast, thirteen on the right, and thirteen on the left shoulder. The law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a> permitted forty blows, but only thirty-nine were given, in order to avoid a possible miscount. During the punishment the chief judge read aloud <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-38.htm">Psalm 68:38</a>, 39. The possibility of death under the infliction was contemplated in the provision which exonerated the executioner unless he should exceed the legal number of blows. Paul escaped Roman scourging at Jerusalem on the ground of his Roman citizenship. It is not related that he and Silas urged this privilege at Philippi until after the scourging. It is evident from the narrative that they were not allowed a formal hearing before the magistrates; and, if they asserted their citizenship, it may have been that their voices were drowned by the mob. That this plea did not always avail appears from the case cited by Cicero against Verres, that he scourged a Roman citizen in spite of his continued protest under the scourge, "I am a Roman citizen" (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>), and from well-known instances of the scourging of even senators under the Empire.<p>Prisons<p>At Philippi, and other places not recorded.<p>Deaths<p>Perils of death, as at Damascus, Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Thessalonica, Beroea. </body></html>
