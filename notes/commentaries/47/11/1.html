It is impossible to resist the inference that here also we have the echo of something which Titus had reported to him as said by his opponents at Corinth. Their words, we must believe, had taken some such form as this: “We really can bear with him no longer; his folly is becoming altogether intolerable.”<p><span class= "bld">And indeed bear with me.</span>—The words, as the marginal reading indicates, admit of being taken either as imperative or indicative. Either gives an adequate meaning, but the latter, it is believed, is preferable. It is one of the many passages in which we trace the working of conflicting feelings. Indignation prompts him to the wish, “Would that ye could bear.” Then he thinks of the loyalty and kindness which he had experienced at their hands, and he adds a qualifying clause to soften the seeming harshness of the words that had just passed from his lips: “And yet (why should I say this? for) ye do indeed habitually bear with me.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Would to God you could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.">2 Corinthians 11:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Would to God </span>— Rather, <span class="ital">I wish; </span>(for the word <span class="ital">God </span>is not in the original text;) <span class="ital">you could bear a little with me </span>— So does he pave the way for what might otherwise have given offence; <span class="ital">in my folly </span>— Of commending myself, which to many may appear folly; and really would be so if it were not, on this occasion, absolutely necessary for the maintaining of my authority among you. <span class="ital">For, </span>&c. — I therefore do it because <span class="ital">I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy </span>— <span class="ital">Jealousy </span>is a passion which renders a person impatient of a rival or partner, with respect to a thing or person beloved. By telling them he was jealous over them, the apostle gives them to know he so exceedingly loved them, that he could not bear that any should pretend to have more regard for them than he had; and withal that he feared lest their affections should be alienated not only from him, but also from Christ, through the insinuations of false teachers among them, and they should be rendered unfaithful to him here, and unfit to be presented to him as his spouse hereafter. <span class="ital">For </span>— By successfully preaching the gospel to you, and bringing you into the engagements of the Christian covenant; <span class="ital">I have espoused you to one husband </span>— Even to him whose servant and ambassador I am, and have led you into a holy contract with him, which hath been mutually scaled; <span class="ital">that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ </span>— Pure in affection, and spotless in your conduct. “Here,” says Whitby, “is thought to be an allusion to the <span class="greekheb">αρμοσυνοι </span>of the Lacedemonians,” a sort of magistrates, whose office it was to educate and form young women, especially those of rank and figure, designed for marriage, and then to present them to those who were to be their husbands; and if this officer permitted them, through negligence, to be corrupted, between the espousals and consummation of the marriage, great blame would naturally fall upon him. “The Greek commentators, however, agree with our translation, rendering <span class="greekheb">ηρμοσαμην</span>, here used, by <span class="greekheb">εμνηστευσα</span>, <span class="ital">I have espoused you. </span>As therefore the Jews say that Moses espoused Israel to God in mount Sinai, when he made them enter into covenant with him; so, saith the apostle here, by converting you to the Christian faith, I have espoused you to one husband, even Christ.” The betrothing of persons to Christ is accomplished in the present life, but their marriage is to take place in the life to come; when they shall be brought home to their husband’s house, to live with him for ever. And the apostle, having betrothed the Corinthian believers to Christ, was anxious to preserve them chaste or true to their future spouse, that when the time of their marriage came, they might not be rejected by him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-4 The apostle desired to preserve the Corinthians from being corrupted by the false apostles. There is but one Jesus, one Spirit, and one gospel, to be preached to them, and received by them; and why should any be prejudiced, by the devices of an adversary, against him who first taught them in faith? They should not listen to men, who, without cause, would draw them away from those who were the means of their conversion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Would to God - Greek, "I would" (&#x39f;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  Ophelon). This expresses earnest desire, but in the Greek there is no appeal to God. The sense would be well expressed by "O that," or "I earnestly wish."<p>Ye could bear with me - That you would bear patiently with me; that you would hear me patiently, and suffer me to speak of myself.<p>In my folly - Folly in boasting. The idea seems to be, "I know that boasting is generally foolish, and that it is not to be indulged in. But though it is to be generally regarded as folly, yet circumstances compel me to it, and I ask your indulgence in it." It is possible also that his opponents accused him of folly in boasting so much of himself.<p>And indeed bear with me - Margin, "Ye do bear." But the text has probably the correct rendering. It is the expression of an earnest wish that they would tolerate him a little in this. He entreats them to bear with him because he was constrained to it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 11<p>2Co 11:1-33.
