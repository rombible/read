They had formed the purpose of giving, they had begun to lay by and to collect, before their rivals had started. They had, as it were, scored those two points in that game of honourable competition. It was “profitable for them” that he, as a by-stander watching the game, should give them a hint, so that they might not at last be ignominiously defeated. It is not easy to fix the exact limits of time indicated in the “year ago.” The First Epistle was written about Easter. Then, after remaining at Ephesus for a while, there came the journey to Troas; then that to Macedonia; then the coming of Titus, bringing word that the Corinthians had acted on the command of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1</a>.

Good beginnings are well; but we lose the benefit, unless there is perseverance. When men purpose that which is good, and endeavour, according to their ability, to perform also, God will not reject them for what it is not in their power to do. But this scripture will not justify those who think good meanings are enough, or that good purposes, and the mere profession of a willing mind, are enough to save. Providence gives to some more of the good things of this world, and to some less, that those who have abundance might supply others who are in want. It is the will of God, that by our mutual supplying one another, there should be some sort of equality; not such a levelling as would destroy property, for in such a case there could be no exercise of charity. All should think themselves concerned to relieve those in want. This is shown from the gathering and giving out the manna in the wilderness, Ex 16:18. Those who have most of this world, have no more than food and raiment; and those who have but little of this world, seldom are quite without them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And herein I give my advice - Not undertaking to command them, or to prescribe how much they should give.

In the two former, not only the act, but the intention, the Corinthians preceded the Macedonians. Bengel explains, "Not only to do" FOR THE PAST YEAR, "but also to be forward" or willing FOR THIS YEAR. Ellicott translates, "already," instead of "before": "Ye began already a year ago, not only to do, but also to be forward." It appears hence, that something had been done in the matter a year before; other texts, however, show the collection was not yet paid (compare 2Co 8:11 and 2Co 9:5, 7). This agrees with one, and only one supposition, namely, that every man had laid by in store the fund from which he was afterwards to contribute, the very case which is shown by 1Co 16:2 to have existed [Paley, Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Giving to those that were in want, was matter of precept (it being what the law of God and nature did require); but giving as the Macedonians had given, not only to, but beyond, their ability, was not so. Or, possibly, the apostle’s saying, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I give my advice, </span> doth not suppose what he advised to be no commanded duty; friends may advise us to what is our duty to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For, </span> saith the apostle, <span class="bld">this is expedient for you; </span> for your profit, or for your honour and reputation. A precept alone ought to oblige us to this doing of the thing commanded, but the profit, credit, and honour of the action adds an edge to the duty, and layeth us under a double obligation; the first, of obedience to God; the second, of being wise for ourselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago:</span> the apostle proveth the expediency of it from the concern of their reputation in it; that they might not be thought to have gone backward, or to become weary of well doing, in regard they had begun this charitable work some time before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Objection.</span> But how cometh he here to put doing before willing (for so it is in the Greek, <span class="ital">not only to do, but</span> also yelein, to will)? Some tell us these hysterologies, or putting things after which should in order be before, are usual in holy writ; but possibly it is better answered by others, that yelein here doth not signify the mere inclination of the will, but a forwardness, (thus our translators understood it, and therefore translate it <span class="ital">to be forward</span>), or a spontaneous willingness, without arguments used by others to persuade them to it. So as the sense is this: You not only began to do the thing a year ago, but you did it of your own accord, without our exhortations and arguments, of your own free mind and will; so as if you should now be behind hand, it would be a reproach to you. This sense is favoured by the next verse, what he here calls a willing, he there calls <span class="ital">a readiness to will.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And herein I give my advice,.... As Daniel did to Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>. The apostle did not choose to make use of his apostolical authority, or give orders, as he sometimes did in such cases; he did not think fit to speak by way of commandment, obliging them to what they ought to do willingly; looking upon this the most prudential step, and wisest method he could take in order to succeed, only to give his judgment in this matter, as what would be best for them, and most conducive to their real good: <p>for this is expedient for you; most versions read it, "profitable"; doing acts of beneficence is profitable to persons, as to things temporal, God usually blessing such with a greater affluence of the things of life, and which indeed is often promised; and is also profitable with respect to things spiritual, for if God does not make it up to them in temporal enjoyments, yet with his presence, the discoveries of his love, the joys of his salvation, and an increase of every grace; so Gaius, that hospitable man to the apostle, and all Christian strangers, was in much spiritual health, and a prosperous condition in his soul, when but in an ill state with respect to his body: yea, such a conduct is profitable in relation to things eternal; for as it springs from the grace of God, and men are assisted therein by it, and is exercised towards persons that have received it, it will be rewarded with a reward of grace; though it may be, the apostle here does not so much argue from the utility, as the decency of it in the Corinthians; <p>who, says he, <p>have began before, a year ago, not only to do, but also to be forward, or "willing": it is hard to say whether the apostle designs to commend or reprove them; and indeed, it seems as if there was a mixture of praise and dispraise in this passage; it was in their favour that they had begun before, even a year ago, and were willing and forward of themselves to this good work; yea, were the first that set it on foot, and so were an example to the Macedonian churches, and others; but then this was against them, that the other churches, which began later than they, had finished before them; whether this their charity was obstructed, as some have thought, through some affliction and persecution that befell them, which if it appeared would much excuse them; or rather it was neglected through lukewarmness and indolence; wherefore the apostle gives his sentiments, that to save their own credit, it was expedient for them to finish what they had begun; for otherwise, as their boasting of them would be in vain, so they would expose themselves to contempt and incur disgrace; and it was not only proper that they should do this, but do it willingly, and with much cheerfulness, for that is meant by being "forward" or "willing"; that they not only do it, but do it with a good will, which they at first discovered. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> And herein I give <i>my</i> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> be forward a year ago.</span><p>(5) He takes good heed that he seem not to wrest it out of them by force, for unless it is voluntary, God does not accept it.<p>(g) Not only to do, but also to do willingly: for he notes out of a ready willingness, without any enforcement by any other men.

And <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> is not, with most, including Rückert, de Wette, Ewald, Neander, to be referred to the <span class="ital">supplying of charitable gifts</span>, in which case <span class="greekheb">συμφέρει</span> is either left without more precise definition (Rückert: “like every good deed, bringing advantage”), or is interpreted as pointing to the advantage of good repute (Grotius, comp. also Hofmann), of the divine recompense (Calovius) and the moral advantage (Flatt), or as useful for salvation (Bisping), and so on. <span class="greekheb">Τοῦτο γὰρ ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συμφ</span>. contains, in fact, the ground why Paul proceeds in this matter merely <span class="ital">by way of advising</span>; hence, with Billroth, Osiander, and Kling, <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> is to be referred to the previous <span class="greekheb">γνώμην</span> … <span class="greekheb">δίδωμι</span>. It is no objection to this, that in <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span> immediately before the pronoun referred to the distribution. For in the previous clause <span class="greekheb">γνώμην δίδωμι</span> contained the whole thought, and <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span> had no stress laid on it, not even needing to be inserted. Accordingly: <span class="ital">for this</span>—that I do not command you, but only give my opinion in the matter—<span class="ital">is serviceable to you</span>, is fitted to operate in the way of moral improvement on you, as being persons who have already shown yourselves to be such as need not command, but only counsel. The <span class="ital">emphasis</span> lies primarily on <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> and next on <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>. According to Hofmann, who does not take <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.">2 Corinthians 8:9</a> parenthetically, in <span class="greekheb">καὶ γνώμην κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. there is meant to follow something new and further, so that both <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span> and subsequently <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> point to the advice, which Paul intends to give (<span class="ital">with the following</span> … <span class="ital">what follows</span>), and this advice is expressed in the imperative clause <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-11.htm" title="Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.">2 Corinthians 8:11</a>, to which <span class="greekheb">οἵτινες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. belongs as a protasis. Against this confusion it may be decisively urged, first, that the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span> emphatically pointing forward must have been placed first; secondly, that after <span class="greekheb">δίδωμι</span> there would come not at all the announced <span class="greekheb">γνώμη</span>, but in the first instance an argumentative parenthetic clause, which would again begin with “<span class="ital">what follows</span>,”—a course which could only lead the reader astray; thirdly, that if <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν συμφέρει</span> does not go with <span class="greekheb">οἵτινες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and find its more precise explanation therein, it would interpolate a thought altogether indefinite and isolated; fourthly, that <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> after <span class="greekheb">νυνί</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-11.htm" title="Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.">2 Corinthians 8:11</a> most naturally introduces a new sentence; lastly, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-11.htm" title="Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.">2 Corinthians 8:11</a> has not in the least the form of a <span class="greekheb">γνώμη</span>, of an expression of opinion, but a form purely <span class="ital">praeceptive</span>, as, indeed, that which the apostle has put under the considerate point of view of a testing and a <span class="greekheb">γνώμη</span> in <span class="ital">contrast</span> to an <span class="greekheb">ἐπιταγή</span>, was already contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="Therefore, as you abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:7</a> and has nothing more to do with the direct precept of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-11.htm" title="Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.">2 Corinthians 8:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἵτινες</span>] <span class="ital">ut qui</span>, includes the specifying of the <span class="ital">reason</span>.

Castalio in the <span class="ital">Adnot</span>.) ultimately comes: “vos haud mora, uno momento facere et velle coepistis.” The explanation of others (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Gregory, Erasmus, Calvin, Beza, Cornelius a Lapide, Clericus, Heumann, Bauer, <span class="ital">Log.

The latter says (<span class="ital">Dissert.</span> II. p. 9): “<span class="ital">hoc modo non solum</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸ θέλειν</span> <span class="ital">tanquam gravius</span> <span class="greekheb">τῷ ποιεῖν</span> <span class="ital">oppositum est (nam qui nova beneficia veteribus addere vult, plus illo agit, qui in eo quod praestitit, subsistit) sed etiam v</span>. <span class="greekheb">προενάρξασθαι</span> <span class="ital">utrique bene congruit, illi</span> (<span class="greekheb">τῷ ποιῆσαι</span>), <span class="ital">quoniam nondum tantum pecuniae erogaverant, quantum ad justam</span> <span class="greekheb">λογίαν</span> <span class="ital">sufficere videretur, huic</span> (<span class="greekheb">τῷ θέλειν</span>) <span class="ital">quoniam in hac nova, voluntate huc usque acquieverant</span>.” In this way the change of tenses in <span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΈΛΕΙΝ</span></span></span> would be quite appropriate; both would apply (this in opposition to Billroth’s objection) to the same fact, to the work of collecting begun in pursuance of 1 Corinthians 16, which, however, would be viewed not according to two different <span class="ital">sides</span> (Billroth), objective (<span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι</span>) and subjective (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΈΛΕΙΝ</span></span></span>), but according to two different <span class="ital">stages</span>, in respect of the first activity and of the further willing, so that now also the <span class="ital">third</span> stage, the execution of this further willing, must be added to complete the whole matter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-11.htm" title="Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.">2 Corinthians 8:11</a>. But since there is no indication whatever of the reference of <span class="greekheb">τὸ θέλειν</span> to a <span class="ital">further</span> willing (following on the <span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι</span>), and that a willing arrested as to its realization; and since, on the other hand, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟ</span></span></span> in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΕΝΉΡΞ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> permits for the climactic relation <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΜΌΝΟΝ ΤῸ ΠΟΙῆΣΑΙ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΛᾺ ΚΑῚ ΤῸ ΘΈΛΕΙΝ</span></span></span> only <span class="ital">the</span> temporal reference, that the <span class="greekheb">θέλειν</span> must have been <span class="ital">earlier</span> than the <span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι</span>, and consequently <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΜΌΝΟΝ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΛᾺ ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> is a climax of time pointing not forward, but <span class="ital">backward:</span> the view of Fritzsche is to be given up as not accordant with the context. There remains as the only correct view, that of Cajetanus and Estius, which de Wette (and after him Winer, p. 521 [E. T. 701 f.], also Wieseler, <span class="ital">Chronol. d. apost. Zeitalt.</span> p. 364) has defended, that <span class="greekheb">προενήρξ</span>. places the readers in comparison as to time with the <span class="ital">Macedonians</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;">2 Corinthians 8:1</a> ff.): <span class="ital">not only the doing</span> (the carrying out of the action of collecting), <span class="ital">but also already the willing has begun earlier among you</span> than among the Macedonians; you have <span class="ital">anticipated</span> them in <span class="ital">both</span> respects. With this view it is obvious that Paul <span class="ital">could not but</span> logically place <span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι</span> before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΈΛΕΙΝ</span></span></span>. The offence, which this arrangement would otherwise occasion, cannot be got over by the pregnant meaning, which Hofmann puts into the <span class="ital">present</span> <span class="greekheb">θέλειν</span>, viz. that it denotes the <span class="ital">steady attitude of mind sustained</span> up to the execution (comp. Billroth). This would, in fact, be a <span class="ital">modal definition</span> of the willing, which Paul would doubtless have known how to <span class="ital">designate</span>, but could not put into the bare <span class="ital">present</span>.[276] And such an <span class="ital">attitude of mind</span> would withal have already existed <span class="ital">before</span> the <span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι</span>, and would not simply have come afterward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠῸ ΠΈΡΥΣΙ</span></span></span>] More precise definition of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟ</span></span></span> in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΕΝΉΡΞ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>: <span class="ital">since the previous year</span>.

The last is in itself the most natural, and also the most probable, considering the great variety as to the times of beginning the year, to which he would have had to accommodate himself in the various provinces, and considering not less the acquaintance with the Jewish calendar which he could take for granted in all his churches. Consequently there lies between the composition of our first and second Epistles the time from Easter till at least after the beginning of the new year in Tisri.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[274] This inversion is followed also by Luther, not in the translation, but in the gloss: “<span class="ital">You have been the first, who willed it and also did it</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[275] Who says: “<span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι</span> est <span class="ital">dare</span>; <span class="greekheb">θέλειν ποιῆσαι</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">ποιήσειν</span> vel <span class="greekheb">δώσειν</span>, <span class="ital">daturum esse</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[276] The <span class="ital">present</span> denotes simply the <span class="ital">being disposed</span> as the <span class="ital">habitus</span> of readiness <span class="ital">prevailing</span> in the case, by way of distinction from the historical <span class="ital">doing</span> (<span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι</span>), through which the <span class="greekheb">θέλειν</span> became active.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.">2 Corinthians 8:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ γνώμην κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">and herein I give my opinion, for this</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, that he should offer them an opinion rather than give a command in this matter, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>) <span class="ital">is better, i.e.</span>, is morally profitable, <span class="ital">for you, inasmuch as you</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.

This parallel is important, as showing that <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ πέρυσι</span> does not necessarily mean “a year ago”. It must be borne in mind that St. Paul is writing from Macedonia and probably in the month of November. Now the Macedonian year, like the Jewish, began with October, so that the phrase would be strictly justifiable, according to the chronological scheme adopted in the <span class="ital">Introd.</span> (p. 13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>10. <span class="ital">And herein I give my advice</span>] See <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-8.htm" title="I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.">2 Corinthians 8:8</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for this</span>] Either (1) ‘that I advise and not command,’ or (2) ‘this proof of your love.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">expedient</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">profitable</span>.

There is much difference of opinion among the commentators concerning the apparent inversion of the natural order in this sentence. But it would seem that the Apostle, as we might expect from such passages as ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>, &c., attaches more importance to the <span class="ital">motive</span> than to the action. They not only had begun to do the work, but they had resolved to do so upon a full persuasion that it was the right thing to do. Their conduct was due to no mere transitory impulse, but was the deliberate conviction of the heart. To this “readiness to will” (see next two verses) the Apostle appeals, and invites them to further action on the ground that the principle on which they acted was just as true now as it had been in the previous year. See note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-7.htm" title="Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a year ago</span>] Better, perhaps, <span class="bld">last year</span> (<span class="ital">the former yeere</span>. Wiclif; <span class="ital">ab anno priore</span>. Vulgate). St Paul probably speaks as a Jew. But it is uncertain whether he refers to the Jewish civil or ecclesiastical year, the former of which began with the month Tisri, answering to part of our September and October, the latter with the month Abib or Nisan. The former is more probable, for the Apostle must have been writing too near the commencement of the latter to give any force to his remark.

The "to do" is in the aorist, the "to be willing" in the present. We should naturally have expected a reversed order, "not only to be willing, but also to put in action." There must be a strong touch of irony in the words, unless we interpret it to mean "not only to make the collection, but to be willing to add yet more to it." Perhaps in the "to be willing" lies the notion of "the cheerful giver," "the willing mind "(ch. 9:7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A year ago;</span> rather, <span class="accented">since the previous year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> last year (ch. 9:2). They had probably begun to collect in the previous Easter, and it was now soon after Tisri, or September, the beginning of the Jewish civil year. </body></html>
