It is great grace and favour from God, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. He commends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paul should urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we use or lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we give for charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing all really good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory to him whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is. Abundant spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour of love.

Doddridge remarks that this is a noble hyperbole, similar to that used by Demosthenes when he says, "I have performed all, even with an industry beyond my power."

But in this case the remark, which on this interpretation would be no independent element, but only the negative expression of what was already said in <span class="greekheb">αὐθαίρετοι</span>, would have had its logical position immediately behind <span class="greekheb">αὐθαίρετοι</span>; and it must have run not as it is written by Paul, but: <span class="greekheb">καθὲς οὐκ ἠλπίσαμεν</span>. No, the apostle says: and their giving did not remain within the limits of the hope which we had formed regarding them, but far surpassed these (<span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἑαυτοὺς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἑαυτοὺς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">but themselves they gave</span>, etc. An expression of the highest Christian readiness of sacrifice and liberality, which, by giving up all individual interests, is not only a contribution of <span class="ital">money</span>, but a <span class="ital">self-surrender</span>, in the first instance, <span class="ital">to the Lord</span>, since in fact <span class="ital">Christ</span> is thereby served, and also to <span class="ital">him</span> who conducts the work of collection, since he is to the giver the <span class="ital">organ</span> of Christ. Flatt and Billroth, following Mosheim and Heumann, are wrong in making <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span> <span class="ital">before</span> in the sense: <span class="ital">before I asked them</span>. This reference is not in the least implied in the immediate context (<span class="greekheb">οὐ καθὼς ἠλπίσ</span>.); and if it were, <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span> must have had the first place:[269] <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ πρῶτον ἑαυτοὺς ἔδωκαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. As the words stand, <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτούς</span> has the emphasis of the contrast with <span class="greekheb">οὐ καθὼς ἠλπίσ</span>. Bengel also (comp. Schrader) is wrong in thinking that in <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span> there is implied <span class="ital">prae munere</span>: the Macedonians, before they made collection, had first given themselves to the Lord, and then left it to the apostle to determine how large their contribution should be. In that case there must have been inserted <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ χρήματα ἡμῖν</span>, or something similar, as a correlative to <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοὺς πρῶτον τῷ κυρίῳ</span>. It is wrong to find in <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτούς</span> the idea merely of <span class="ital">voluntarily</span>.[270] <span class="ital">without any summons</span>, because it is <span class="ital">object</span> of the having given.
