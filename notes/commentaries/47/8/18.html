The general current of patristic interpretation (represented, we may add, in the Collect for St. Luke’s Day in the Prayer Book of the Church of England, though not in that of the Breviary of the Church of Rome) ran in favour of St. Luke; but this rested on the assumption, for which there is no evidence, and against which there is a strong balance of probabilities, that he was already well known as the writer of a Gospel. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke, </span>Vol. I., p. 239.) Apart from this, however, it may be urged that there is more evidence in favour of this hypothesis than of any other. If the words be interpreted, as they must, as pointing to a preacher of the gospel, we have indications of St. Luke having done this at Antioch, at Troas, and at Philippi. None of the other companions of St. Paul who have been suggested, such as Tychicus or Trophimus, was likely to have so wide-spread a reputation. None was so likely to be with him at the time at Philippi. And it may be noted further—and this, so far as I know, is a point which has not hitherto been dwelt on—that there was no man so fitted to stir up the Corinthians, by his personal character, to a worthy completion of the good work they had begun. We have seen that in his Gospel he dwells emphatically on all parts of our Lord’s teaching that point out the danger of riches and the blessedness of a generous almsgiving (see <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke,</span> Vol. I., p. 242); how at Philippi his influence was traceable in the liberal supplies sent to St. Paul at Thessalonica (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-40.htm" title="And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.">Acts 16:40</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15</a>) and at Corinth (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>). Was not such a man, we may ask, eminently adapted for the mission on which the “brother, whose praise is in the gospel,” was now sent? and was not the Apostle likely to choose him above all others for it? For Mark and Gaius, who have also been suggested, there is not a shadow of evidence; and as the latter was of Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>), he was not likely to have been sent thither from Philippi. The tense, “we have sent,” is, as before, the epistolary aorist, used of the time at which the letter was being written.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 The apostle commends the brethren sent to collect their charity, that it might be known who they were, and how safely they might be trusted. It is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far as we can, all unjust suspicions. It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christ as instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful, and employed in his service. The good opinion others have of us, should be an argument with us to do well.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And we have sent with him the brother - It has been generally supposed that this anonymous brother was Luke. Some have supposed however that it was Mark, others that it was Silas or Barnabas. It is impossible to determine with certainty who it was; nor is it material to know. Whoever it was, it was some one well known, in whom the church at Corinth could have entire confidence. It is remarkable that though Paul mentions him again <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>, he does it also in the same manner, without specifying his name. The only circumstances that can throw any light on this are:<p>(1) That Luke was the companion and intimate friend of Paul, and attended him in his travels. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10-11</a>, where Luke uses the term "we," it appears that he was with Paul when he first went into Macedonia, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a> it is clear that he went with Paul to Philippi. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-1.htm">Acts 17:1</a>, where Luke alters his style and uses the term "they," it is evident that he did not accompany Paul and Silas when they went to Thessalonica, but either remained at Philippi or departed to some other place. He did not join them again until they went to Troas on the way to Jerusalem; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5</a>. In what manner Luke spent the interval is not known. Macknight supposes that it might have been in multiplying copies of his gospel for the use of the churches. Perhaps also he might have been engaged in preaching, and in services like that in the case before us.<p>(2) it seems probable that Luke is the person referred to by the phrase "whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches." This would be more likely to be applied to one who had written a gospel, or a life of the Redeemer that had been extensively circulated, than to any other person. Still it is by no means certain that he is the person here referred to, nor is it of material consequence.<p>Whose praise - Who is well known and highly esteemed.<p>Is in the gospel - Either for writing the gospel, or for preaching the gospel. The Greek will bear either construction. In some way he was celebrated for making known the truths of the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. the brother, whose praise is in the gospel&#8212;whose praise is known in connection with the Gospel: Luke may be meant; not that "the Gospel" here refers to his written Gospel; but the language implies some one well known throughout the churches, and at that time with Paul, as Luke then was (Ac 20:6). Not a Macedonian, as appears from 2Co 9:4. Of all Paul's "companions in travel" (2Co 8:19; Ac 19:29), Luke was the most prominent, having been his companion in preaching the Gospel at his first entrance into Europe (Ac 16:10). The fact that the person here referred to was "chosen of the churches" as their trustee to travel with Paul in conveying the contribution to Jerusalem, implies that he had resided among them some time before: this is true of Luke, who after parting from Paul at Philippi (as he marks by the change from "we" to "they," Ac 16:11) six years before, is now again found in his company in Macedonia. In the interim he had probably become so well known that "his praise was throughout all the churches." Compare 2Co 12:18; Phm 24. He who is faithful in the Gospel will be faithful also in matters of inferior importance [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Who this other <span class="bld">brother</span> was, whether Luke, or Barnabas or Silas, or Apollos, or Mark, is not much material; it is plain, whoever he was, that he was a brother and a minister one who had a good repute for preaching the gospel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And we have sent with him the brother,....

It would not have been in keeping with the <span class="ital">prudence</span> of the apostle to send with Titus the very brother of the latter and even his own brother (according to Rückert’s view of <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμ</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-22.htm" title="And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, on the great confidence which I have in you.">2 Corinthians 8:22</a>). <span class="ital">Who</span> is meant, remains quite an open question. Some have conjectured <span class="ital">Barnabas</span> (<span class="greekheb">τινές</span> in Chrysostom, and Chrysostom himself, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Luther, Calvin, and others) or <span class="ital">Silas</span> (Baronius, Estius); but the <span class="ital">rank</span> of these was not consistent with the position of a companion subordinate to <span class="ital">Titus</span>; nor is there anywhere a trace of Barnabas and Paul having ever united again for common work after their separation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-39.htm" title="And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;">Acts 15:39</a>). Others (comp. also the usual subscription of the Epistle) think that it was <span class="ital">Luke</span>. So Origen, <span class="greekheb">τίνες</span> in Chrysostom, Jerome, Ambrosiaster, Pelagius, Primasius, Anselm, Cajetanus, Cornelius a Lapide, and others, including Grotius, Emmerling, Schrader, Olshausen, Köhler (<span class="ital">Abfassungszeit</span>, p. 85), of whom those named <span class="ital">before Grotius</span> referred <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ εὐαγγ</span>. to the Gospel of Luke (at that time not yet even in existence). But from the very brief statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-1.htm" title="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.">Acts 20:1</a> ff. there is no proof to be drawn either <span class="ital">for</span> (Olshausen) or <span class="ital">against</span> (Rückert); and Ignatius, <span class="ital">ad Ephes</span>. (interpol.) 15, to which Emmerling, after Salmeron and others, has again appealed, proves nothing further than that this unknown author either referred or merely applied our passage to Luke. The conjecture which points to <span class="ital">Erastus</span> (Ewald, following <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm" title="So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm" title="Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.">2 Timothy 4:20</a>) cannot be made good.

II. p. 339; Tobler, <span class="ital">Evangelienfr</span>. p. 12). The <span class="ital">result</span> remains: <span class="ital">we do not know who it was</span>. So much only in reference to the two persons indicated here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-22.htm" title="And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, on the great confidence which I have in you.">2 Corinthians 8:22</a>, and in opposition to the conjectures adduced, is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>, that they were not fellow-labourers in the apostolic work, like Titus, but other Christians of distinction.[279] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>. Against this <span class="ital">non liquet</span> Rückert indeed objects, that in that case the Corinthians would not have known which of the two was meant to be here designated, since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2 Corinthians 8:23</a> both are called <span class="greekheb">ἀπόστολοι ἐκκλησιῶν</span>, by which all distinction is precluded.

The Patristic reference (Origen, Jerome, etc.) of these words to St. Luke is stereotyped in the Collect for St. Luke’s Day, but there is hardly room for doubt that this is due to a mistaken interpretation of <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγέλιον</span> as signifying a <span class="ital">written</span> Gospel, rather than the “good news” of God delivered orally by the first Christian preachers. We have no positive data by which to determine which of St. Paul’s contemporaries is here alluded to. It has been argued that as this unnamed “brother” is seemingly subordinate to Titus, he must not be identified with persons so important as (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>) Apollos or Silas; and, again, that, as he was apparently not a Macedonian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>), he cannot be any of the prominent members of the Macedonian Church (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-5.htm" title="And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.">2 Corinthians 8:5</a> above). Trophimus the Ephesian is not impossible (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm" title="(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)">Acts 21:29</a>), but it is idle to speculate where the evidence is so scanty. The important point about this unnamed brother is that he was selected not by St. Paul, but by the Churches who took part in the work of collecting money as their representative as is now explained.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>18. <span class="ital">And we have sent with him</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">we sent with him</span>, unless the tense be what is known as the epistolary aorist (see above, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>), in which case these messengers were also the bearers of this Epistle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the brother, whose praise is in the gospel</span>] Innumerable guesses have been made as to who this was. We can but briefly glance at them. First of all it is clear that it was no obscure member of any of the various communities who is here mentioned. He was thoroughly well known to the Churches. Secondly, we may remark that it was not <span class="ital">Barnabas</span>, as many of the early Fathers have supposed, since we never hear of Paul and Barnabas as travelling together after their misunderstanding in Acts 15, nor <span class="ital">Silas</span>, for he does not appear to have been with the Apostle after his departure from Corinth for Jerusalem related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>. We learn from the next verse that the ‘brother’ here referred to was a delegate of the Churches, and deputed to accompany St Paul on his journey to Jerusalem with the proceeds of the collection. He must either have been a delegate of the Ephesian or the Macedonian Christians. If the latter, it must have been (1) St Luke, for he <span class="ital">did</span> travel with St Paul on this occasion, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a>. And though he did not join the Apostle till he reached Philippi from Corinth, and did not accompany him on his visit to Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-1.htm" title="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia....">Acts 20:1-5</a>), this is no reason against his having accompanied Titus on his visit to Corinth. See note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.">2 Corinthians 8:16</a></span>. And St Luke answers in many ways better than any one else to this description. But ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.">2 Corinthians 9:4</a> seems to imply that the brother was not of Macedonia (though Meyer thinks that the whole context shews him to have been a Macedonian). Nor can the words ‘whose praise is in the Gospel’ be pressed (so St Chrysostom and the Collect for St Luke’s Day) as signifying the Gospel of St Luke. For the word gospel is never used in the Scripture of any of the biographies of Christ, but solely of the good tidings proclaimed by His ministers. The earliest phrase by which the Gospels are designated is ‘memoirs.’ (See Justin Martyr’s <span class="ital">First Apology</span>, ch. 67.) If the brother were an Ephesian delegate, he must have been either (2) Trophimus or (3) Tychicus. <span class="ital">Both</span> these left Greece with St Paul. The former was an Ephesian’ and accompanied him to Jerusalem. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm" title="(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)">Acts 21:29</a>.) The latter was ‘<span class="ital">of Asia</span>’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>), and probably of Ephesus, for he was twice sent thither by St Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-12.htm" title="And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.">2 Timothy 4:12</a>). And he evidently stood high in the estimation of the Apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:...">Ephesians 6:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:...">Colossians 4:7-8</a>) for his qualities as a minister of Christ. <span class="ital">Both</span> these, however, if the deputies were Ephesians, would most likely have been the messengers. See note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-22.htm" title="And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, on the great confidence which I have in you.">2 Corinthians 8:22</a></span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2 Corinthians 8:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συνεπέμψαμεν</span>, <span class="ital">we have sent along with him</span>) Timotheus and I.

There can be no reference to any of the four written Gospels, for they were not in the hands of Christians till a later date; nor did the word "gospel" acquire this significance till afterwards. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5</a>, it is somewhat precariously inferred that  St. Luke is meant. Others have conjectured Barnabas, Silas (who are out of the question), Erastus, Mark, a brother of Titus, etc. St. Luke is not unlikely to have been selected as a delegate by the Church of Philippi; but further than this we can say nothing. St. Luke was not a Macedonian by birth, and any Macedonian (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Aristarchus, Sopater, Secundus, Epaphroditus) seems to be excluded by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>. Palsy notes it as curious that the <span class="accented">object</span> of St. Paul's journey to Jerusalem, Which is so prominent in this group of Epistles, is only mentioned indirectly and incidentally by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>) in the Acts of the Apostles. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The brother whose praise is in the Gospel<p>Is should be joined with throughout all the churches; as Rev., whose praise in the Gospel is spread throughout, etc. The person referred to has been variously identified with Titus' brother, Barnabas, Mark, Luke, and Epaenetus, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>. The reference to Epaenetus has been urged on the ground of a supposed play upon the word praise, epainos; Epaenetus meaning praiseworthy; and the parallel is cited in the case of Onesimus profitable, of whom Paul says that he will henceforth be useful, Plm 1:11. </body></html>
