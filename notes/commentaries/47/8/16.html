This is the second character of the person who was sent by the apostle with Titus to Corinth. He was chosen by the churches of Macedonia to accompany Paul to Jerusalem, to witness his delivering their gift. This character, likewise, agrees very well to Luke. For having resided long at Philippi, he was well known to the Macedonian churches, who, by making him their messenger to Judea, showed their great respect for him. <span class="ital">Avoiding this </span>— Taking care of this; <span class="ital">that no man should blame us </span>— Charge me with any undue partial dealing, or as being unfaithful; <span class="ital">in this abundance </span>— This large collection, the management of which is intrusted with us. <span class="ital">Providing for honest, </span>or honourable <span class="ital">things, not only in the sight of the Lord </span>— To whom it is and ought to be our first and chief care to approve ourselves; <span class="ital">but also in the sight of men </span>— From whose minds I wish to remove every suspicion which might hinder my usefulness. <span class="ital">And we have sent with them </span>— That is, with Titus and Luke; <span class="ital">our brother </span>— Probably Apollos; <span class="ital">whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many </span>other affairs, <span class="ital">but now much more </span>— In his endeavours to promote the collection among you; <span class="ital">upon the great confidence, </span>&c. — That is, I have sent him with them upon the great confidence which I have as to your goodness and liberality. Or, connecting the clause with the words immediately preceding, the sense is, that the brother spoken of was much more ready to come to Corinth, and active in his endeavours to forward the collection, upon the great confidence which he had in the good disposition of the Corinthians to the work.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 The apostle commends the brethren sent to collect their charity, that it might be known who they were, and how safely they might be trusted. It is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far as we can, all unjust suspicions. It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christ as instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful, and employed in his service. The good opinion others have of us, should be an argument with us to do well.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But thanks be to God - Paul regarded every right feeling, and every pure desire; every inclination to serve God or to benefit a fellow mortal, as the gift of God.

The poor saints in Judea indeed were to have the immediate benefit of the contribution, but it was a privilege for them to give, and Paul rejoiced that they had that privilege. A man who presents to Christians a feasible object of benevolence, and who furnishes them an opportunity of doing good to others, is doing good to them, and they should esteem it an act of kindness done to them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17.

The apostle proceeds to give an account of the persons and their characters, who were employed in making this collection at Corinth for the poor saints, and begins with Titus; and the rather because he had been already concerned in setting afoot that good work among them; and gives thanks to God, <p>which, says he, <p>put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you, by "earnest care" is meant that very great carefulness, solicitude, and diligence, Titus had shown in stirring them up to a liberal contribution; and which was the same that he had expressed in the arguments just now used by him, to engage them in the same service; and this care, as it was a very earnest and hearty one, so he suggests that it was more for them, than for the sake of the poor; the performance of acts of beneficence and liberality tending more to the advantage and account of the giver than of the receiver: and he further intimates, that these good motions in the heart of Titus were not merely natural, or the effects of human power and free will, but were of God, as every good thing is; they were wrought in him by the Spirit of God, and sprung from the grace of God, and therefore the apostle returns thanks to God for the same; and the mention of this could not fail of carrying weight with it, and of having some influence on the minds of the Corinthians. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> But thanks <i>be</i> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</span><p>(8) He commends Titus and his two companions for many reasons, both that their credit might not be suspected, as though he had sent them slyly to rob the churches, and also so that they might be all the more ready to contribute.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.">2 Corinthians 8:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] continuativ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χάρις τῷ θεῷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ διδόντι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] language of the deeply religious consciousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-17.htm" title="But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.">Romans 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm" title="For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.">Php 2:13</a>).
