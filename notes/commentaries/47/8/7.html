He opens, as was his manner, with words of praise, and dexterously combines the gifts of “utterance and knowledge,” which he had acknowledged before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1Corinthians 1:5</a>), with the “earnestness and love” of which he had spoken in this very Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2Corinthians 7:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And in your love to us.</span>—Some MSS. give the reading “our love for you,” but that in the text has abundant authority, and gives a far better meaning. The English expresses the general meaning, but there is a subtle delicacy in the Greek: “the love which, flowing from you, rests in us as its object.” The other reading would convey the sense of “the love which, flowing from us—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from our teaching and influence—now dwells in you, and shows itself in act.” In any case, he is praising them for a quality which is actually theirs.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:7-9 Faith is the root; and as without faith it is not possible to please God, Heb 11:6, so those who abound in faith, will abound in other graces and good works also; and this will work and show itself by love. Great talkers are not always the best doers; but these Corinthians were diligent to do, as well as to know and talk well. To all these good things the apostle desires them to add this grace also, to abound in charity to the poor. The best arguments for Christian duties, are drawn from the grace and love of Christ. Though he was rich, as being God, equal in power and glory with the Father, yet he not only became man for us, but became poor also. At length he emptied himself, as it were, to ransom their souls by his sacrifice on the cross. From what riches, blessed Lord, to what poverty didst thou descend for our sakes! and to what riches hast thou advanced us through thy poverty! It is our happiness to be wholly at thy disposal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore as ye abound in everything - see the note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>. Paul never hesitated to commend Christians where it could be done with truth; and the fact that they were eminent in some of the Christian duties and graces, he makes the ground of the exhortation that they would abound in all. From those who had so many eminent characteristics of true religion he had a right to expect much; and he therefore exhorts them to manifest a symmetry of Christian character.<p>In faith - In the full belief of the truth and obligation of the gospel.<p>And utterance - In the ability to instruct others; perhaps referring to their power of speaking foreign languages; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>.<p>And knowledge - The knowledge of God, and of his truth.<p>And in all diligence - Diligence or readiness in the discharge of every duty. Of this, Paul had full evidence in their readiness to comply with his commands in the case of discipline to which so frequent reference is made in this Epistle.<p>And in your love to us - Manifested by the readiness with which you received our commands; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6-7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-16.htm">2 Corinthians 7:16</a>.<p>See that ye abound in this grace also - The idea here is, that eminence in spiritual endowments of any kind, or in any of the traits of the Christian character should lead to great benevolence, and that the character is not complete unless benevolence be manifested toward every good object that may be presented. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. in faith&#8212;(2Co 1:24).<p>utterance&#8212;(See on [2317]1Co 1:5).

He did not turn divinity into mere words and rhetorical flourishes; yet he made use of these sometimes, as a waiting maid to divinity. Being therefore to press upon these Corinthians this great duty of charity, he insinuateth himself into them, by telling them, that they abounded in all other spiritual habits: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Faith, </span> by which they had both steadily assented to the truth of gospel propositions, and also received Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Utterance, </span> by which they were enabled either to speak with tongues, or to God in prayer. For to men by prophecy and exhortation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Knowledge, </span> both of things Divine and human. And in <span class="ital">love</span> to the ministers of the gospel, which, if it did not appear in all, yet it did in many of them. And from hence he fetcheth an argument to press them to be complete in this habit of grace. The force of the apostle’s argument lies, in the duty of all Christians to strive after perfection, and that natural desire, which is in all ingenuous people, to be perfect in that good of which they have a taste in less perfect degrees. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore as ye abound in everything,.... In all gifts and every grace, in the use and exercise of them, insomuch that they were enriched in everything, and wanted nothing; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>, that is here expressed in general, is explained by particulars following: <p>in faith: both in the doctrine of faith, which they had received and professed, held fast to, and abode by; yea, they abounded in the knowledge of it, zeal for it, and thankfulness to God on account of it; and in the grace of faith, not an historical one, nor the faith of miracles, but that which is peculiar to God's elect, is the gift of his grace and the work of his Spirit, which has Christ for its object, and works by love; in this they abounded, inasmuch as they had a large measure of it, grew in it, were full of it, and were much in the exercise thereof: <p>in utterance, or "speech": meaning either the gift of speaking with tongues, which many in this church had; or the gift; of understanding and explaining the word of God with much freedom; or a liberty of mind and speech to declare their faith in Christ, and make an ingenuous confession of it to others: <p>in knowledge; of God and of Christ, and of the truths of the Gospel: <p>and in all diligence: their ministers were diligent in preaching the Gospel, the people in hearing the word, and attending on ordinances, and both studiously careful to keep up the discipline of the church; and very industrious to discharge the several duties of religion, and to assist one another, both in things temporal and spiritual: <p>and in your love to us: the apostles and ministers of the word, whom they loved, esteemed, and honoured for their works' sake: and since they were so eminent for these graces, and the exercise of them, the apostle exhorts them to liberality to the poor saints; <p>see that ye abound in this grace also; for as faith, utterance, knowledge, diligence, and love to Christ's ministers are graces; so also is kindness shown to Christ's poor members, it is a gift of God's grace, cannot be rightly exercised without the assistance of his grace, has for its objects men who have received the grace of God, and will be rewarded with a reward of grace; persons eminent for the several graces of the Spirit of God, and the exercise of them, it may be not only desired, but expected from them, that they should abound in the exercise of beneficence to the poor. This is another argument exciting to that good work. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="Therefore, as you abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀλλʼ</span>] is not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> (Beza and others, also Flatt), nor to <span class="ital">agedum</span> (Emmerling), but is the Latin <span class="ital">at, breaking off</span> the preceding statement, like the German <span class="ital">doch</span>.

Olshausen has a more far-fetched idea, that it is corrective: yea rather. And Billroth imports quite arbitrarily: “When I entreated Titus, I knew beforehand that this time also you would not deceive me, but that, as you are distinguished in all that is good, so also you would zealously further this collection;” and Rückert also (similarly Calvin): “I have entreated Titus, etc.; yet let it not happen that he should need first to encourage you (?), yea rather, etc.” According to Hofmann, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> forms the transition to the <span class="greekheb">οὐ κατʼ ἐπιταγὴν λέγω</span> which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-8.htm" title="I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.">2 Corinthians 8:8</a>; but this supposes a very involved construction (comp. afterwards on <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ ἐν παντὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">as you in every relation are abundant</span> (<span class="ital">excellitis</span>) <span class="ital">through faith</span> (strength, fervour, and efficacy of faith), <span class="ital">and discourse</span> (aptitude in speaking), <span class="ital">and knowledge</span> (see regarding both on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>), <span class="ital">and every diligence</span> (“studium ad agendas res bonas,” Grotius), <span class="ital">and your love to us, so should you abound in showing this kindness</span>.
