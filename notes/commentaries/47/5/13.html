This also had been said of him, and the intense sensitiveness of his nature made him wince under it. Some there were at Corinth who spoke of his visions and revelations, his speaking with tongues as in ecstasy, his prophecies of future judgment, as so many signs of madness. “He was beside himself.” (Comp. Agrippa’s words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm" title="And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.">Acts 26:24</a>, and Note there.) Others, or, perhaps, the same persons, pointed to his tact, becoming all things to all men, perhaps even insinuated that he was making money by his work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;">2Corinthians 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.">2Corinthians 12:10</a>): “he was shrewd enough when it served his turn.” He answers accordingly both the taunts.

Well-grounded hopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let all consider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord. Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workers of iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument and persuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as his disciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and the good of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect upon us, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone, dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves, and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died. We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living and actions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how many show the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living to themselves and to the world!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For whether we be beside ourselves - This is probably designed to meet some of the charges which the false teachers in Corinth brought against him, and to furnish his friends there with a ready answer, as well as to show them the true principles on which he acted, and his real love for them. It is altogether probable that he was charged with being deranged; that many who boasted themselves of prudence, and soberness, and wisdom, regarded him as acting like a madman. It has not been uncommon, by any means, for the cold and the prudent; for formal professors and for hypocrites to regard the warm-hearted and zealous friends of religion as maniacs. Festus thought Paul was deranged, when he said, "Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad," <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm">Acts 26:24</a>; and the Saviour himself was regarded by his immediate relatives and friends as beside himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21</a>. And at all times there have been many, both in the church and out of it, who have regarded the friends of revivals, and of missions, and all those who have evinced any extraordinary zeal in religion, as deranged. The object of Paul here is to show, whatever might be the appearance or the estimate which they affixed to his conduct, what were the real principles which actuated him. These were zeal for God, love to the church, and the constraining influences of the love of Christ, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-15</a>. The word rendered here as "be beside ourselves" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  exeste&#772;men, from &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;  existe&#772;mi) means properly, to put out of place; to be put out of place; and then to be put out of oneself, to astonish, to fill with wonder; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-22.htm">Luke 24:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm">Acts 8:11</a>; and then to be out of one's mind, to be deranged. Here it means that they were charged with being deranged, or that others esteemed, or professed to esteem Paul and his fellow-laborers deranged.<p>It is to God - It is in the Cause of God, and from love to him. It is such a zeal for him; such an absorbing interest in his cause; such love prompting to so great self-denial, and teaching us to act so much unlike other people as to lead them to think that we are deranged. The doctrine here is, that there may be such a zeal for the glory of God, such an active and ardent desire to promote his honor, as to lead others to charge us with derangement. It does not prove however that a man is deranged on the subject of religion because he is unlike others, or because he pursues a course of life that differs materially from that of other professors of religion, and from the man of the world. He may be the truly sane man after all; and all the madness that may exist may be where there is a profession of religion without zeal; a professed belief in the existence of God and in the realities of eternity, that produces no difference in the conduct between the professor and other people; or an utter unconcern about eternal realities when a man is walking on the brink of death and of hell. There are a few people that become deranged by religion; there are millions who have no religion who act as madmen. And the highest instances of madness in the world are those who walk over an eternal hell without apprehension or alarm.<p>Or whether we be sober - Whether we are sane, or of sound mind; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-15.htm">Mark 5:15</a>. Tyndale renders this whole passage: "For if we be too fervent, to God we are too fervent; if we keep measure, for our cause keep we measure." The sense seems to be, "if we are esteemed to be sane, and sober-minded, as we trust you will admit us to be, it is for your sake. Whatever may be the estimate in which we are held, we are influenced by love to God, and love to man. In such a cause, we cannot but evince zeal and self-denial which may expose us to the charge of mental derangement; but still we trust that by you we shall be regarded as influenced by a sound mind. We seek your welfare. We labor for you. And we trust that you will appreciate our motives, and regard us as truly sober-minded." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. be&#8212;rather as Greek, "have been."

As some took them to be, and as Festus thought the Apostle Paul was, because of the doctrines they preached, and the self-commendation they were obliged to enter into through the calumnies of their adversaries; in which they did not so much seek their own reputation, as the honour and glory of God, which was struck at through them: <p>it is to God; it is for his glory, and not our own, that we act this part, for which we are condemned as madmen. <p>Or whether we be sober; think and speak meanly of ourselves, and behave with all modesty and lowliness of mind: it is for your cause; for your instruction and imitation. The glory of God, and the good of his churches, were what concerned them in every part of life. Some refer this to the apostle's being, or not being, in an ecstasy or rapture. Others to his speaking, either of the more sublime doctrines of the Gospel, on account of which he was reckoned mad, though in the delivering of them he had nothing else but the glory of God in view; or of the lower and easier truths of it, which were more accommodated to meaner capacities; in doing which he sought their edification and advantage. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> For whether we be beside ourselves, <i>it is</i> to God: or whether we be sober, <i>it is</i> for your cause.</span><p>(7) The meaning is: even when I am mad (as some men think of me), while I seem as a fool to boast about myself, I do it for your profit, to the same extent that I do when I preach only the Gospel to you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.">2 Corinthians 5:13</a>. And you have reason for making your boast on our behalf over against the adversaries!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That Paul is here dealing, and that not without irony, with an odious accusation of his opponents (perhaps of an overseer of the church, according to Ewald), is evident, since otherwise the peculiar mode of expression used by him would appear quite uncalled for. It must have been asserted that he <span class="ital">had gone out of his senses</span>, that he <span class="ital">had become mad</span> (observe the <span class="ital">aorist</span>),—an assertion for which narrow-mindedness as well as malice might find cause enough, or seize pretext, in the extraordinary heroism and divine zeal of his working in general, and especially in his sudden and wonderful conversion, in the ecstasies and visions[225] which he had had, in his anti-Judaism at times unsparing, in his ideal demands on the Christian life, in the prominence given to his consciousness of apostleship, to his sufferings, and the like. In reference to this accusation he now says: “<span class="ital">For be it, that we have become mad</span> (as our enemies venture to assert), <span class="ital">it is a madness standing at the service of God</span> (a holy mania, which deserves respect, not blame!); <span class="ital">or be it, that we are of sound understanding, we are so for your service</span> (which can only be found by you praiseworthy).” Comp. Aretius, Rückert, de Wette, Osiander, Hilgenfeld (in his <span class="ital">Zeitschr.</span> 1864, p. 170), who, however, abides only by the apostle’s assertion, that he had seen Christ and was a full apostle, as the ground for this opinion of his opponents. As early as the time of Chrysostom (he quotes an explanation: <span class="greekheb">εἰ μὲν μαίνεσθαί τις ἡμᾶς νομίζει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.) it was recognised that a glance at a hostile accusation was contained in <span class="greekheb">ἐξέστημεν</span>, and this is remarked by most of the older and the modern commentators; but there should have been the less hesitation at taking the word in its full sense (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm" title="And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.">Mark 3:21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm" title="And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.">Acts 26:24</a>), whereas it was often weakened into: <span class="ital">ultra modum agere</span>,[226] or into: <span class="ital">to be foolish</span> (Chrysostom, Morus, Billroth), <span class="ital">to seem to act foolishly</span> (Flatt), and the like, in spite of the following <span class="greekheb">σωφρονοῦμεν</span>, which is the exact opposite of having become <span class="ital">mad</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Phaedr.</span> p. 244 A). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-25.htm" title="But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.">Acts 26:25</a>. As regards the <span class="ital">subject-matter</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξέστ</span>. was mostly (as by Chrysostom and Theodoret) referred to the <span class="ital">self-praise</span>,[227] in which case <span class="greekheb">θεῷ</span> was taken as: <span class="ital">to the honour of God</span>, and then <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> was referred either to the salutary <span class="ital">example</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἵνθ μάθητε ταπεινοφρονεῖν</span>, Chrysostom, Flatt) or to the salutary <span class="ital">condescension</span>. So Erasmus,[228] Vatablus, Menochius, Estius, Bengel, Emmerling, Olshausen. Billroth takes it differently: “If, however, you put a rational construction on it (this boasting), in my case, I wish to have myself boasted of only for your advantage; I do it only in order that <span class="ital">you</span> may not be deceived by my opponents regarding me.” But the whole reference to the <span class="ital">self-praise</span> is after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>, where Paul has absolutely negatived the <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοὺς συνιστάνομεν ὑμῖν</span>, contrary to the context; and those references of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span> to the example shown, or to the apostolic condescension, or to a deception of the readers to be prevented, are not in keeping with the parallel <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕῷ</span></span></span>; and there is no reason in the context for sacrificing the uniformity in compass of meaning of the two datives, so that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span> is not to be taken otherwise than with Grotius in the comprehensive sense of <span class="ital">in vestros usus</span>. According to Hofmann, <span class="greekheb">ἐξέστ</span>. is to be referred to the self-testimony expressed <span class="ital">loftily</span> and in the <span class="ital">most exalted</span> tone at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.">2 Corinthians 2:14</a> ff.: “If it might there be said <span class="ital">that he had gone out of himself</span>, on the other hand, the succeeding explanation (begun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>) could only produce the impression of sober rationality.” But in this way there is in fact assumed a retrospective reference for <span class="greekheb">ἐξέστ</span>., which no reader and, excepting Hofmann, no expositor could have conjectured, and this all the less that from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a> to the present passage Paul has been speaking of himself in a tone to a great extent lofty and exalted (<span class="ital">e.g</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:">2 Corinthians 3:2</a> f., 12 ff., the whole of chap. 4, particularly after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2 Corinthians 5:1</a> ff.); so that we do not see on what so great a difference of judgment is to be based, as would be yielded by <span class="greekheb">ἐξέστ</span>. and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΩΦΡΟΝ</span></span></span>.

But St. Paul bids them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>) look a little deeper, and not judge by mere outward phenomena such as these. He repeatedly asks them to bear with his seeming foolishness (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Would to God you could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.">2 Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-16.htm" title="I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little....">2 Corinthians 11:16-17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-6.htm" title="For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he sees me to be, or that he hears of me.">2 Corinthians 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing.">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>). It is possible that a charge of a contrary nature had been also made by his opponents, and that his regard for other men’s prejudices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>), and the “craftiness” with which he caught the Corinthians “with guile” (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-16.htm" title="But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>), were urged as savouring more of worldly wisdom than of true piety. His answer to both charges is contained in this verse. If he has exceeded the bounds of moderation, it is in his moods of highest devotion, when he is pouring out his soul to God and not to man; if he has exercised a sober prudence in his dealings with his converts, it is all for their sakes, and not for selfish ends.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>13. <span class="ital">For whether we be besides ourselves</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">were</span> beside ourselves, i.e. when we were with you. The reproach of madness was afterwards cast upon St Paul by Festus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm" title="And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.">Acts 26:24</a>), and may well have been cast upon him before this. Cf. Acts 17.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">it is to God</span>] Better, for God, i.e. for His cause. See ‘for your cause’ below. Literally, for you.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">or whether we be sober</span>] The word here used signifies the quiet self-restraint characteristic of the Christian. Its original meaning is <span class="ital">to have one’s thoughts safe</span>, and hence to be of sound, healthy mind (cf. the Latin <span class="ital">salvus</span> and our ‘safe and sound’). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-15.htm" title="And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.">Mark 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-35.htm" title="Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.">Luke 8:35</a> (where the word is opposed to the idea of madness). Also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-3.htm" title="For I say, through the grace given to me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.">Romans 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm" title="That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.">Titus 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-4.htm" title="That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,">Titus 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-6.htm" title="Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.">Titus 2:6</a>, &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.">2 Corinthians 5:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἴτε ἐξέστημεν ἔιτε σωφρονοῦμεν</span>) The former is treated of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-15.htm" title="And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again....">2 Corinthians 5:15-21</a> :—the latter <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain....">2 Corinthians 6:1-10</a>. The force of the one word is evident from the other, to act <span class="ital">without</span> or <span class="ital">with moderation</span>. Paul might seem to be without moderation from the Symperasma,[29] which he gave in the preceding verse [<span class="ital">namely, adorning his office with so many encominiums</span>.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">Θεῷ</span>, it is to <span class="ital">God</span>) viz., <span class="ital">that we have acted without moderation</span>, although men do not understand us.—<span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">it is to you</span>) Even godly men bear the moderation of their teachers with a more favourable feeling, than their <span class="greekheb">ἔκστασις</span>, <span class="ital">excessive enthusiasm;</span> but it is their duty to obey the Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[29] See App. A brief and summary conclusion from the previous premisses.—T.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For whether we be beside ourselves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for whether we were mad</span>. Evidently some person or some faction had said of St. Paul, "He is beside himself," just as Festus said afterwards, "Paul, thou art mad," and as the Jews said of Paul's Lord and Master (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-20.htm">John 10:20</a>). The fervour of the apostle, his absorption in his work, his visions and ecstasies, his "speaking with tongues more than they all," his indifference to externals, his bursts of emotion, might all have given colour to this charge, which he here ironically accepts. "Mad or self controlled -all was for your sakes." <span class="cmt_word">It is to God;</span> rather <span class="accented">for God</span>. My "enthusiasm," "exaltation," or, if you will, my "madness," was but a phase of my work for him. <span class="cmt_word">We be sober.</span> The word "sober" (<span class="accented">sophron</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> derived from two words which mean" to <span class="accented">save the mind</span>." It indicates wise self control, such as was represented also by the many-sided Latin word <span class="accented">frugi</span>. It is the exact antithesis to madness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-25.htm">Acts 26:25</a>). What you call my "madness" belongs to the relation between my own soul and God; my practical sense and tact are for you. <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for you</span>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We are beside ourselves (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-22.htm">Luke 24:22</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-7.htm">Acts 2:7</a>; and see on the kindred &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; astonishment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-42.htm">Mark 5:42</a>.
