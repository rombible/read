To know a man “after the flesh” is to know him by the outward accidents and circumstances of his life: his wealth, rank, culture, knowledge. St. Paul had ceased to judge of men by those standards. With him the one question was whether the man was, by his own act and choice, claiming the place which the death of Christ had secured for him, and living in Him as a new creature. That is the point of view from which he now “knows,” or looks on, every man.<p><span class= "bld">Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh.</span>—What, we ask, gave occasion to this strange parenthesis? What did it mean? To what stage of the Apostle’s life does it refer? (1) The answer to the first question is probably to be found in once more reading between the lines. There was, we know, a party at Corinth claiming a special relation to Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>). They probably did so as having been personal disciples. If they were like those who elsewhere claimed to speak in the name of James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:">Acts 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a>), they were likely to urge his claims as the brother of the Lord. To St. Paul such a way of judging would be to know Christ after the flesh—to judge of Him, as of others, by the lower standard of the world. (2) The next question is more difficult. The hypothetical form of the proposition practically implies an admission of its truth. It is hardly conceivable that he refers to the time before his conversion, and means that he too had once seen and known Jesus of Nazareth, judging of Him “after the flesh,” by an earthly standard, and therefore had thought that He ought to do many things against him; or that, after the revelation of Christ in him, at the time of his conversion, he had, for a time, known Him after a manner which he now saw to be at least imperfect. The true solution of the problem is probably to be found in the fact that he had once thought, even before he appeared as the persecutor of the Church, of the Christ that was to come as others thought, that his Messianic expectations had been those of an earthly kingdom restored to Israel. Jesus of Nazareth did not fulfil those expectations, and therefore he had opposed His claim to be the Messiah. Now, he says, he had come to take a different view of the work and office of the Christ. (3) It follows, if this interpretation is correct, that he speaks of the period that preceded his conversion. not of an imperfect state of knowledge after it, out of which he had risen by progressive stages of illumination and clearer vision of the truth. Now and from henceforth, he seems to say, we think of Christ not as the King of Israel, but as the Saviour of mankind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-16.htm" title="Why from now on know we no man after the flesh: yes, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now from now on know we him no more.">2 Corinthians 5:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore henceforth </span>— So that from this time that we knew the love of Christ; <span class="ital">know we no man </span>— Neither ourselves nor you, neither the rest of the apostles, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-6.htm" title="But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:">Galatians 2:6</a>,) nor any other person; <span class="ital">after the flesh </span>— According to his former state, country, descent, nobility, riches, power, wisdom.

The believer is created anew; his heart is not merely set right, but a new heart is given him. He is the workmanship of God, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Though the same as a man, he is changed in his character and conduct. These words must and do mean more than an outward reformation. The man who formerly saw no beauty in the Saviour that he should desire him, now loves him above all things. The heart of the unregenerate is filled with enmity against God, and God is justly offended with him. Yet there may be reconciliation. Our offended God has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ. By the inspiration of God, the Scriptures were written, which are the word of reconciliation; showing that peace has been made by the cross, and how we may be interested therein. Though God cannot lose by the quarrel, nor gain by the peace, yet he beseeches sinners to lay aside their enmity, and accept the salvation he offers. Christ knew no sin. He was made Sin; not a sinner, but Sin, a Sin-offering, a Sacrifice for sin. The end and design of all this was, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him, might be justified freely by the grace of God through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. Can any lose, labour, or suffer too much for Him, who gave his beloved Son to be the Sacrifice for their sins, that they might be made the righteousness of God in him?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore henceforth - In view of the fact that the Lord Jesus died for all people, and rose again. The effect of that has been to change all our feelings, and to give us entirely new views of people, of ourselves, and of the Messiah, so that we have become new creatures. The word "henceforth" (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;  apo tou nun) means properly from the present time; but there is no impropriety in supposing that Paul refers to the time when he first obtained correct views of the Messiah, and that he means from that time. His mind seems to have been thrown back to the period when these new views burst upon his soul; and the sentiment is, that from the time when he obtained those new views, he had resolved to know no one after the flesh.<p>Know we no man - The word "know" here (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  oidamen) is used in the sense of, we form our estimate of; we judge; we are influenced by. Our estimate of man is formed by other views than according to the flesh.<p>After the flesh - A great many different interpretations have been proposed of this expression, which it is not needful here to repeat. The meaning is, probably, that in his estimate of people he was not influenced by the views which are taken by those who are unrenewed, and who are unacquainted with the truths of redemption. It may include a great many things, and perhaps the following:<p>(1) He was not influenced in his estimate of people by a regard to their birth, or country. He did not form an attachment to a Jew because he was a Jew, or to a Gentile because he was a Gentile. He had learned that Christ died for all, and he felt disposed to regard all alike.<p>(2) he was not influenced in his estimate of people by their rank, and wealth, and office. Before his conversion he had been, but now he learned to look on their moral character, and to regard that as making the only permanent, and really important distinction among people. He did not esteem one man highly because he was of elevated rank, or of great wealth, and another less because he was of a different rank in life.<p>(3) it may also include the idea, that he had left his own kindred and friends on account of superior attachment to Christ. He had parted from them to preach the gospel. He was not restrained by their opinions; he was not kept from going from land to land by love to them. It is probable that they remained Jews. It may be, that they were opposed to him, and to his efforts in the cause of the Redeemer. It may be that they would have dismissed him from a work so self-denying, and so arduous, and where he would be exposed to so much persecution and contempt. It may be that they would have set before him the advantages of his birth and education; would have reminded him of his early brilliant prospects; and would have used all the means possible to dissuade him from embarking in a cause like that in which he was engaged. The passage here means that Paul was influenced by none of these considerations.<p>In early life he had been. He had prided himself on rank, and on talent. He was proud of his own advantages as a Jew; and he estimated worth by rank, and by national distinction, <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-6</a>. He had despised Christians on account of their being the followers of the man of Nazareth: and there can be no reason to doubt that he partook of the common feelings of his countrymen and held in contempt the whole Gentile world. But his views were changed - so much changed as to make it proper to say that he was a new creature, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>. When converted, he did not confer with flesh and blood <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>; and in the school of Christ, he had learned that if a man was his disciple, he must be willing to forsake father and mother. and sister and brother, and to hate his own life that he might honor him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>. He had formed his principle of action now from a higher standard than any regard to rank, or wealth, or national distinction; and had risen above them all, and now estimated people not by these external and factitious advantages, but by a reference to their personal character and moral worth.<p>Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh - Though in common with the Jewish nation we expected a Messiah who would be a temporal prince, and who would be distinguished for the distinctions which are valued among people, yet we have changed our estimate of him, and judge of him in this way no longer. There can be no doubt that Paul, in common with his countrymen, had expected a Messiah who would be a magnificent temporal prince and conqueror, one who they supposed would be a worthy successor of David and Solomon. The coming of such a prince, Paul had confidently expected. He expected no other Messiah. He had fixed his hopes on that. This is what is meant by the expression 'to know Christ after the flesh.' It does not mean that he had seen him in the flesh, but that he had formed, so to speak, carnal views of him, and such as people of this world regard as grand and magnificent in a monarch and conqueror. He had had no correct views of his spiritual character, and of the pure and holy purposes for which he would come into the world.<p>Yet now henceforth know we him no more - We know him no more in this manner. Our conceptions and views of him are changed. We no more regard him according to the flesh; we no longer esteem the Messiah who was to come as a temporal prince and warrior; but we look on him as a spiritual Saviour, a Redeemer from sin. The idea is, that his views of him had been entirely changed. It does not mean, as our translation would seem to imply, that Paul would have no further acquaintance with Christ, but it means that from the moment of his conversion he had laid aside all his views of his being a temporal sovereign, and all his feelings that he was to be honored only because he supposed that he would have an elevated rank among the monarchs of the earth. Locke and Macknight, it seems to me, have strangely mistaken this passage. The former renders it, "For if I myself have gloried in this, that Christ was himself circumcised as I am, and was of my blood and nation, I do so now no more any longer," The same substantially is the view of Macknight. Clarke as strangely mistakes it, when he says that it means that Paul could not prize now a man who was a sinner because he was allied to the royal family of David, nor prize a man because he had seen Christ in the flesh.<p>The correct view, as it seems to me, is given above. And the doctrine which is taught here is, that at conversion, the views are essentially changed, and that the converted man has a view of the Saviour entirely different from what he had before. He may not, like Paul, have regarded him as a temporal prince; he may not have looked to him as a mighty monarch, but his views in regard to his person, character, work, and loveliness will be entirely changed. He will see a beauty in his character which he never saw before. Before, he regarded him as a root out of dry ground; as the despised man of Nazareth; as having nothing in his character to be desired, or to render him lovely <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>; but at conversion the views are changed. He is seen to be the chief among ten thousand and altogether lovely; as pure, and holy, and benevolent; as mighty, and great, and glorious; as infinitely benevolent; as lovely in his precepts, lovely in his life, lovely in his death, lovely in his resurrection, and as most glorious as he is seated on the right hand of God. He is seen to be a Saviour exactly adapted to the condition and needs of the soul; and the soul yields itself to him to be redeemed by him alone.<p>There is no change of view so marked and decided as that of the sinner in regard to the Lord Jesus Christ at his conversion; and it is a clear proof that we have never been born again if our views in reference to him have never undergone any change. "What think ye of Christ?" is a question the answer to which will determine any man's character, and demonstrate whether he is or is not a child of God. Tyndale has more correctly expressed the sense of this than our translation."

Wherefore&#8212;because of our settled judgment (2Co 5:14),<p>henceforth&#8212;since our knowing Christ's constraining love in His death for us.<p>know we no man after the flesh&#8212;that is, according to his mere worldly and external relations (2Co 11:18; Joh 8:15; Php 3:4), as distinguished from what he is according to the Spirit, as a "new creature" (2Co 5:17). For instance, the outward distinctions of Jew or Gentile, rich or poor, slave or free, learned or unlearned, are lost sight of in the higher life of those who are dead in Christ's death, and alive with Him in the new life of His resurrection (Ga 2:6; 3:28).<p>yea, though&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "if even."<p>known Christ after the flesh&#8212;Paul when a Jew had looked for a temporal reigning, not a spiritual, Messiah. (He says "Christ," not Jesus: for he had not known personally Jesus in the days of His flesh, but he had looked for Christ or the Messiah). When once he was converted he no longer "conferred with flesh and blood" (Ga 1:16). He had this advantage over the Twelve, that as one born out of due time he had never known Christ save in His heavenly life. To the Twelve it was "expedient that Christ should go away" that the Comforter should come, and so they might know Christ in the higher spiritual aspect and in His new life-giving power, and not merely "after the flesh," in the carnal aspect of Him (Ro 6:9-11; 1Co 15:45; 1Pe 3:18; 4:1, 2). Doubtless Judaizing Christians at Corinth prided themselves on the mere fleshly (2Co 11:18) advantage of their belonging to Israel, the nation of Christ, or on their having seen Him in the flesh, and thence claimed superiority over others as having a nearer connection with Him (2Co 5:12; 2Co 10:7). Paul here shows the true aim should be to know Him spiritually as new creatures (2Co 5:15, 17), and that outward relations towards Him profit nothing (Lu 18:19-21; Joh 16:7, 22; Php 3:3-10). This is at variance with both Romish Mariolatry and transubstantiation. Two distinct Greek verbs are used here for "know"; the first ("know we no man") means "to be personally acquainted with"; the latter ("known Christ &#8230; know &#8230; more") is to recognize, or estimate. Paul's estimate of Christ, or the expected Messiah, was carnal, but is so now no more.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh:</span> words of sense in Scripture ordinarily signify more than the act of that sense which they express; particularly this term <span class="bld">know</span> ordinarily signifieth to approve and acknowledge; and so it signifies here.

Since the death and resurrection of Christ, which has broken down the middle wall of partition, and has took away all distinction of men, we know, we esteem, we value no man on account of his carnal descent, and fleshy privileges, as being of the Jewish nation, a descendant of Abraham, and circumcised as he was; or on account of their outward state and condition, as being rich and honourable among men, or on account of their natural parts and acquirements, their learning, wisdom, and eloquence; nor do we own any man to be a Christian, that lives after the flesh, to himself, and not to Christ; nor do we make account of the saints themselves as in this mortal state, but as they will be in the resurrection, in consequence of Christ's having died for them, and rose again. <p>Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh: some of them had seen him in the flesh; others valued him on account of his being of the Jewish nation, and of his relation to them according to the flesh; and all of them had formerly entertained carnal apprehensions of him, and his kingdom, as though it would be a temporal one: <p>yet now henceforth know we him more; no more in this mortal state, being risen from the dead; nor do we value ourselves upon having seen him in the flesh; for though such a sight and knowledge of him was desirable, yet a spiritual knowledge is much more preferable; and many there were who knew him in the flesh, who neither enjoy his spiritual presence here, nor will they be favoured with his glorious presence hereafter. Moreover, we do not judge of him as we did before we had a spiritual knowledge of him, and as our countrymen did, by his outward circumstances, by his parentage and education, his poverty and afflictions, his company and conversation, that he could not be the Messiah, the Son of God, and therefore was worthy of death; we have quite other thoughts and apprehensions of him now, believing him to be the Christ of God, a spiritual Saviour and Redeemer, whose kingdom is not of this world; we have relinquished all our national prejudices, and former notions, concerning the Messiah, his kingdom, and people.

This remark is added without <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> (see the critical remarks), which is accounted for by the impetuous liveliness of the representation. <span class="ital">If even</span> (as I herewith grant to my opponents, see Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Viger.</span> p. 832) <span class="ital">the case has occurred that we have known Christ according to flesh-standard, this knowing of Him now exists with us no longer</span>. The emphasis of this concessive clause lies on the <span class="ital">praeterite</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐγνώκαμεν</span>, which opposes the past to the present relation (<span class="greekheb">οἴδαμεν</span>, and see the following <span class="greekheb">γινώσκομεν</span>). Therefore <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span> is not placed immediately after <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span>, for Paul wishes to express that in the past it has been otherwise than now; that formerly the <span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σάρκα</span> had certainly occurred in his case, and that in reference to Christ. This in opposition to the <span class="ital">usual</span> interpretation, according to which <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span> is invested with the chief emphasis. So <span class="ital">e.g</span>. Billroth: “if we once regarded even Christ Himself in a fleshly manner, if we quite misjudged Him and His kingdom;” Beyschlag similarly: “even with Christ I make no exception,” etc. Rückert, without any reason whatever, conjectures that Paul erroneously inserted <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span>, or perhaps did not write it at all. The right interpretation is found in Osiander, Ewald, Kling, also substantially in Hofmann, who, however, would attach <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ ἐγνώκαμεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. to <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν</span> … <span class="greekheb">σάρκα</span>, and thus separate it only by a comma,—a course by which, owing to the following contrast <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., the sentence is without sufficient ground made more disjointed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul had known Christ <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span>, so long as the merely human individuality of Christ, His lower, earthly appearance (comp. Chrysostom and Theodoret), was the limit of his knowledge of Him. At the time when he himself was still a zealot against Christ, and His persecutor, he knew Him as a mere man, as a common Jew, not as Messiah, not as the Son of God; as one justly persecuted and crucified, not as the sinless Reconciler and the transfigured Lord of glory, etc. It was quite different, however, since God had revealed His Son in Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>), whereby he had learned to know Christ according to His true, higher, spiritual nature (<span class="greekheb">κατὰ πνεῦμα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>).[233] Comp. also Holsten, <span class="ital">z. Ev. d. Paul, und Petr.</span> p. 429, who, however, refers the <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span>, which denotes the entire historical person of the God-man, only to the heavenly, purely pneumatic personality of the Lord, which had been pre-existent and in this sense was re-established by the resurrection. Klöpper, p. 66, has substantially the right view: the earthly, human appearance of Christ according to its national, legal, and particular limitation. The Judaistic conception of the Messianic idea was the <span class="ital">subjective ground</span> of the former erroneous knowledge of Christ, but it is not on that account to be explained with many (Luther, see his gloss, Bengel, Rückert, and others): <span class="ital">according to Jewish ideas of the Messiah</span>; for, according to what precedes, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. must be the <span class="ital">objective</span> standard of the <span class="greekheb">ἐγνώκαμεν</span>. In that case <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΙΣΤΌΝ</span></span></span> cannot be <span class="ital">appellative</span>, the <span class="ital">Messiah</span> (especially Baur, I. p. 304, ed. 2, and Neander, I. p. 142 f.), but only <span class="ital">nomen proprium</span>, as the following <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις ἐν Χριστῷ</span> shows. Olshausen, who rightly, as to substance, refers <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Σ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> to the life of Christ before His resurrection, deduces, however, from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ΚΑῚ ἘΓΝΏΚ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> that Paul even before his conversion had seen Christ in his visits to Jerusalem, which Beyschlag also, in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1864, p. 248, and 1865, p. 266, gathers from our passage and explains it accordingly, and Ewald, <span class="ital">Gesch. d. apost. Zeitalt.</span> p. 368, ed. 3, thinks credible. This is in itself possible (though nowhere testified), but does not follow from our passage; for <span class="greekheb">ἐγνώκ</span>., in fact, by no means presupposes the <span class="ital">having seen</span>, but refers to the knowledge of Christ obtained by <span class="ital">colloquial intercourse</span>, and determined by the Pharisaic fundamental point of view,—a knowledge which Paul before his conversion had derived from his historical acquaintance with Christ’s earthly station, influence as a teacher, and fate, as known to all.[234] Besides, the interpretation of a personal acquaintance with Christ would be quite unsuitable to the following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛᾺ ΝῦΝ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> It would be <span class="ital">at variance with the context</span>. See also Klöpper, p. 55 ff. According to de Wette, the sense is: “not yet to have so known Christ as, with a renouncing of one’s own fleshly selfishness, to live to Him alone,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-15.htm" title="And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.">2 Corinthians 5:15</a>. But in this way there would result for <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> the sense of the <span class="ital">subjective</span> standard (against which see above); further, the signification of <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σ</span>. would not be the same for the two parts of the verse, since in the second part it would affirm <span class="ital">more</span> (namely, according to fleshly selfishness, <span class="ital">without living to Him alone</span>); lastly, <span class="ital">this</span> having known Christ would not suit the time before the conversion of the apostle, to which it nevertheless applies, because at this time he was even <span class="ital">persecutor</span> of Christ. And this he was, just because he knew him <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> (taken in <span class="ital">our</span> sense), which erroneous form of having known ceased only when God <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκάλυψε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>). While various expositors fail to give to it a clear and definite interpretation,[235] others have explained it in the linguistically erroneous sense of a merely hypothetical possibility. Thus Erasmus: “Nec est, quod nos posteriores apostolos quisquam hoc nomine minoris faciat, quod Christum mortali corpore in terris versantem non novimus, quando etiam, si contigisset novisse, nunc eam notitiam, quae obstabat spiritui, deposuissemus, et spiritualem factum spiritualiter amaremus;” so in the main also Grotius, Rosenmüller, Flatt. For a synopsis of the various old explanations, from Faustus the Manichaean (who proved from our passage that Christ had no fleshly body) downward, see Calovius, <span class="ital">Bibl. ill</span>. p. 463 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>] in the apodosis, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γινώσκομεν</span>] <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα Χριστόν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[233] According to Estius, the meaning is taken to be: “If we once held it as something great to be fellow-countrymen and kinsmen of Christ.” But the words do not convey this. Similarly also Wetstein, who makes the apostle, in opposition to the (alleged) boasting of the false apostles that they were kinsmen and hearers of Christ, maintain, “<span class="ital">cognationem solam nihil prodesse;” et Christum non humilem esse</span>, as on earth, <span class="ital">sed exaltatum super omnes</span>.

In personal religion the merely <span class="ital">historical</span> must yield precedence to the <span class="ital">mystical</span> element; it is of great interest and of real value to learn all that can be known about the Birth, Life, Death and Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, but it is the <span class="ital">present</span> Life of Christ, “in whom” we may be found if we will, that is of religious import, as is further explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>. This “is the same feeling which appears in the fact … that no authentic or even pretended likeness of Christ should have been handed down from the first century; that the very site of His dwelling place at Capernaum should have been entirely obliterated from human memory; that the very notion of seeking for relics of His life and death, though afterwards so abundant, first began in the age of Constantine. It is the same feeling which, in the Gospel narratives themselves, is expressed in the almost entire absence of precision as to time and place” (Stanley). Beyschlag and others (see Knowling, <span class="ital">Witness of the Epistles</span>, p. 2) conclude from the words <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ ἐγνώκαμεν κατὰ σὰρκα Χριστόν</span> that St. Paul had seen, and possibly heard, Jesus during His public ministry at Jerusalem (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>); on this interpretation the words would be introduced at this point to indicate that, however much stress the other Apostles and their adherents might lay on such outward knowledge, yet to St. Paul, though he could lay claim to it as well as they, this did not seem the essential matter. But (<span class="ital">a</span>) the words do not necessarily imply this; it is noteworthy that he says <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span>, not <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦν</span>, which we should expect on Beyschlag’s hypothesis. (<span class="ital">b</span>) The explanation given above is quite in accordance with the usage of <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> with a verb (see reff.), and the order of the words here and in the preceding clause does not allow us to take <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> with <span class="greekheb">οὐδένα</span> in the one case and with <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span> in the other. (<span class="ital">c</span>) As Schmiedel points out, if St. Paul really had had personal experience of the public ministry of Jesus, he would hardly have failed to mention it in the great apologetic passage, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I....">2 Corinthians 11:22-33</a>. Other writers, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Jowett, explain the latter clause of this verse by supposing that the Apostle is contrasting his more mature preaching with his preaching at an earlier stage of his Christian ministry when he had not yet emancipated himself from Jewish prejudices. But of his consciousness of such a “development” in his views, subsequently to his conversion, there is no trace in the Epistles. The contrast is really between Saul the Pharisee and Paul the Apostle of the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>16. <span class="ital">Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh</span>] i.e. we regard no man from a purely fleshly point of view (see note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>), but look upon him as endowed with a new vital principle from above which has changed his heart.

The whole phrase, which has been interpreted in multitudes of different ways, and has led to many different hypotheses, must be understood in accordance with the context. St. Paul is saying that he has now renounced all mere earthly and human judgments; and he here implies that the day has been (whether - which is a very unlikely view - before his conversion, when he looked on Christ as a "deceiver," or just after his conversion, when possibly he may only have known him partially as the <span class="accented">Jewish</span> Messiah) when he knew Christ only in this fleshly way; but henceforth he will know him so no more. Probably this "knowing Christ after the flesh" is a rebuke to those members of the Christ party at Corinth who may have boasted that they were superior to all others because they had personally seen or known Christ - a spirit which Christ himself not only discouraged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>) but even rebuked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>). To St. Paul Christ is now regarded as far above all local, national, personal, and Jewish limitations, and as the principle of spiritual life in the heart of every Christian. In the view which he took of his Lord St. Paul henceforth has banished all Jewish particularism for gospel catholicity. He regards Christ, not in the light of earthly relationships and conditions, but as the risen, glorified, eternal, universal Saviour. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>After the flesh (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;)<p>"He who knows no man after the flesh, has, for example, in the case of the Jew, entirely lost sight of his Jewish origin; in that of the rich man, of his riches; in that of the learned of his learning; in that of the slave, of his servitude" (Alford).

The proper sense will be brought out in reading by emphasizing have. We know no man henceforth after the flesh: even if we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now, etc. Paul refers to his knowledge of Christ before his conversion, a hearsay knowledge, confined to reports of His personal appearance, His deeds, His relations to the Jews, His alleged crime and punishment. When the glorified Christ first spoke to him out of heaven, he asked, "Who art thou?"
