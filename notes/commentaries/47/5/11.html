Tyndale’s and Cranmer’s versions give, “how the Lord is to be feared;” the Rhemish, “fear.” “Terror,” characteristically enough, makes its first appearance in the Geneva version.<p><span class= "bld">We persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God.</span>—The antithesis is singularly indicative of the rapid turn of thought in the Apostle’s mind. “<span class= "ital">We go on our way of winning men</span> to Christ.” (Comp. the use of the same Greek word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm" title="And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.">Acts 12:20</a>, “having made Blastus . . . their friend.”) It is singular to note that, in an Epistle probably nearly contemporary with this, St. Paul uses the phrase almost in a bad sense: “Do we now persuade men, or God?” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> “Are we seeking to please our friends or God?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>.) And here, apparently, the imperfection of the phrase and its liability to misconstruction occurs to him, and he therefore immediately adds, “Yes, we do our work of persuading men” (the case of Felix, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-25.htm" title="And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.">Acts 24:25</a>, may be noted as showing the prominence of “the judgment to come” in St. Paul’s method), “but it is all along with the thought that our own lives also have been laid open in their inmost recesses to the sight of God.” The word “made manifest” is clearly used in reference to the same word (in the Greek) as is translated “appear” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2Corinthians 5:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</span>—The words are an echo of what had already been said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2Corinthians 4:2</a>. He trusts that in their inmost consciences, in the effect of his preaching there, in the new standard of right and wrong which they now acknowledge—perhaps, also, in the estimate which their illumined judgment passes on his own conduct—he has been made manifest as indeed he is, as he is sure that he will be before the judgment-seat of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences....">2 Corinthians 5:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord </span>— The strict judgment which must then pass on all impenitent sinners; <span class="ital">we </span>the more earnestly <span class="ital">persuade men </span>— To repent and believe the gospel, that, instead of being objects of the divine wrath, they may live and die happy in his favour. <span class="ital">But, </span>as <span class="ital">we are made manifest to God </span>— And he knows our integrity; <span class="ital">I trust also </span>it is evident to you. <span class="ital">For we commend not ourselves</span> — We do not say this as if we thought there was any need of <span class="ital">again </span>recommending ourselves <span class="ital">to you, but give you occasion to glory </span>— To rejoice and praise God, and furnish you with an answer to those false apostles; <span class="ital">who glory in appearance, but not in heart </span>— We may infer from this, and from the beginning of chap. 3., that some of the Corinthians were disposed to represent the care which Paul took to vindicate himself, as pride and vainglory. On the other hand, it seems they would have interpreted his silence as the effect of guilt and confusion. He therefore plainly and very properly tells them, that he said this only in his own necessary defence; and to furnish his friends with an answer to those whose consciences condemned them, while they endeavoured to asperse him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-15 The apostle quickens himself and others to acts of duty. Well-grounded hopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let all consider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord. Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workers of iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument and persuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as his disciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and the good of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect upon us, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone, dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves, and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died. We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living and actions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how many show the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living to themselves and to the world!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing therefore - We who are apostles, and who are appointed to preach the gospel, having the fullest assurance of the terrors of the day of judgment, and of the wrath of God, endeavor to persuade people to be prepared to meet Him, and to give up their account.<p>The terror of the Lord - This is, of the Lord Jesus, who will be seated on the throne of judgment, and who will decide the destiny of all people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>. The sense is, knowing how much the Lord is to be feared; what an object of terror and alarm it will be to stand at the judgment-seat; how fearful and awful will be the consequences of the trial of that day. The Lord Jesus will be an object of terror and alarm, or it will be a subject inspiring terror and alarm to stand there on that day, because:<p>(1) He has all power, and is appointed to execute judgment;<p>(2) Because all must there give a strict and impartial account of all that they have done;<p>(3) Because the wrath of God will be shown in the condemnation of the guilty.<p>It will be a day of awful wailing and alarm when all the living and the dead shall be arraigned on trial with reference to their eternal destiny; and when countless hosts of the guilty and impenitent shall be thrust down to an eternal hell. Who can describe the amazing terror of the scene? Who can fancy the horrors of the hosts of the guilty and the wretched who shall then hear that their doom is to be fixed forever in a world of unspeakable woe? The influence of the knowledge of the terror of the Lord on the mind of the apostle seems to have been two-fold; first, an apprehension of it as a personal concern, and a desire to escape it, which led him to constant self-denial and toil; and secondly, a desire to save others from being overwhelmed in the wrath of that dreadful day.<p>We persuade men - We endeavor to persuade them to flee from the wrath to come; to be prepared to stand before the judgment-seat, and to be suited to enter into heaven. Observe here the uniqueness of the statement. It is not, we drive people; or we endeavor to alarm people; or we frighten people; or we appeal merely to their fears, but it is, we persuade people, we endeavor to induce them by all the arts of persuasion and argument to flee from the wrath to come. The future judgment, and the scenes of future woe, are not proper topics for mere declamation. To declaim constantly on hell-fire and perdition; to appeal merely to the fears of people, is not the way in which Paul and the Saviour preached the gospel. The knowledge that there would be a judgment, and that the wicked would be sent to hell, was a powerful motive for Paul to endeavor to "persuade" people to escape from wrath, and was a motive for the Saviour to weep over Jerusalem, and to lament its folly, and its doom; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>. But they who fill their sermons with the denunciations of wrath; who dwell on the words "hell" and "damnation," for the purpose of rhetoric or declamation, to round a period, or merely to excite alarm; and who "deal damnation around the land" as if they rejoiced that people were to be condemned, and in a tone and manner as if they would be pleased to execute it, have yet to learn the true nature of the way to win people to God, and the proper effect of those awful truths on the mind. The true effect is, to produce tenderness, deep feeling, and love; to prompt to the language of persuasion and of tender entreaty; to lead people to weep over dying sinners rather than to denounce them; to pray to God to have mercy on them rather than to use the language of severity, or to assume tones as if they would be pleased to execute the awful wrath of God.<p>But we are made manifest unto God - The meaning of this is, probably, that God sees that we are sincere and upright in our aims and purposes. He is acquainted with our hearts. All our motives are known to him, and he sees that it is our aim to promote his glory, and to save the souls of people. This is probably said to counteract the charge which might have been brought against him by some of the disaffected in Corinth, that he was influenced by improper motives and aims. To meet this, Paul says, that God knew that he was endeavoring to save souls, and that he was actuated by a sincere desire to rescue them from the impending terrors of the day of judgment.<p>And I trust also ... - And I trust also you are convinced of our integrity and uprightness of aim. The same sentiment is expressed in other words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>. It is an appeal which he makes to them, and the expression of an earnest and confident assurance that they knew and felt that his aim was upright, and his purpose sincere. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. terror of the Lord&#8212;the coming judgment, so full of terrors to unbelievers [Estius]. Ellicott and Alford, after Grotius and Bengel, translate, "The fear of the Lord" (2Co 7:1; Ec 12:13; Ac 9:31; Ro 3:18; Eph 5:21).<p>persuade&#8212;Ministers should use the terrors of the Lord to persuade men, not to rouse their enmity (Jude 23). Bengel, Estius, and Alford explain: "Persuade men" (by our whole lives, 2Co 5:13), namely, of our integrity as ministers. But this would have been expressed after "persuade," had it been the sense. The connection seems as follows: He had been accused of seeking to please and win men, he therefore says (compare Ga 1:10), "It is as knowing the terror (or fear) of the Lord that we persuade men; but (whether men who hear our preaching recognize our sincerity or not) we are made manifest unto God as acting on such motives (2Co 4:2); and I trust also in your consciences." Those so "manifested" need have no "terror" as to their being "manifested (English Version, 'appear') before the judgment-seat" (2Co 5:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> We believing and being fully persuaded, that there shall be such a great and terrible day of the Lord, when there shall be such a narrow inquiry and search into whatsoever men have thought, spoke, or done in the flesh; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">we persuade men</span> to believe in the <span class="ital">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, to walk according to the rule of the gospel, to be charitable towards us, and not to censure or judge us, or use against us hard speeches.

Or the fear of the Lord; by which is meant either the grace of the fear of the Lord, implanted in the hearts of the apostles, and in which they acted in their ministry, faithfully dispensing to men the mysteries of grace; from which they could by no means be moved, because the fear of God was before their eyes, and upon their hearts; or rather the terror of the Lord in the last judgment, which will be very great, considering the awfulness of the summons, arise ye dead, and come to judgment; the appearance of the Judge, which will be sudden, surprising, and glorious; the placing of the thrones, the opening of the books, the position of the wicked, the dreadful sentence pronounced on them, and the immediate execution of it; all which the ministers of the word know from the Scriptures of truth; they know the Judge, that there will be a general judgment, and that the day is fixed for it, though they know not the exact time: and therefore <p>persuade men; not that their state is good because of a little outside morality, nor to make their peace with God, or get an interest in Christ, or to convert themselves, neither of which are in the power of men to do; but they endeavour to persuade them by the best arguments they are masters of, taken from the word of God, and their own experience, that they are in a dangerous state and condition, walking in a way that leads to destruction; that they are liable to the curses of the law, the wrath of God, and everlasting ruin; that present duties of religion will not make amends for past sins, nor can their tears atone for their crimes, or any works of righteousness done by them justify them before God; and that salvation is only by Christ, who is both able and willing to save the chief of sinners: and they endeavour to persuade and encourage poor sensible sinners to venture on Christ, and believe in him to the saving of their souls. So the Arabic version reads it, "we persuade men to believe"; though when they have done all they can, these persuasions of theirs are ineffectual, without the powerful and efficacious grace of the Spirit of God; however, in so doing they discharge a good conscience, and act the faithful part to God and men: <p>but we are made manifest unto God; who searches the heart, and tries the reins, who knows all actions, and the secret springs of them; to him the sincerity of our hearts, and the integrity of our conduct, are fully manifest; we can appeal to him that it is his glory, and the good of souls, we have in view in all our ministrations: <p>and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences; that you also can bear witness to our faithfulness and honesty, to the unwearied pains we have taken, and the hearty concern we have shown for the welfare of the souls of men. One of Stephens's copies reads, "and we trust"; which agrees with the apostle's speaking in the first person plural in this, and the preceding verses. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Knowing therefore the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</span><p>(5) Now he moves on, and taking occasion of the former sentence returns to 2Co 4:16, confirming his own and his associates sincerity.<p>(i) That terrible judgment.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] in pursuance of what has just been said, that we all before the judgment-seat of Christ, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φόβον τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κυρίου</span>] The genitive is not genitivus <span class="ital">subjecti</span> (equivalent to <span class="greekheb">τὸ φοβερὸν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κυρ</span>.), as Emmerling, Flatt, Billroth, Osiander, and others hold, following Chrysostom and most of the older commentators (comp. Lobeck, <span class="ital">Paralip</span>. p. 513; Klausen, <span class="ital">ad Aesch. Choeph.</span> 31); for the use of the expression with the genitive taken <span class="ital">objectively</span> is the <span class="ital">standing and habitual</span> one in the LXX., the Apocrypha, and the N. T., according to the analogy of <span class="greekheb">יְהֹוָה יִרְאַת</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-21.htm" title="Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.">Ephesians 5:21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-31.htm" title="Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-18.htm" title="There is no fear of God before their eyes.">Romans 3:18</a>); and the context does not warrant us in departing from this. Hence: since we know accordingly the fear of Christ (as judge); since holy awe before Him is by no means to us a strange and unknown feeling, but, on the contrary, we know how much and in what way He is to be feared. The Vulgate renders rightly: timorem Domini; Beza wrongly: “terrorem illum Domini, i.e. formidabile illud judicium.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπους πείθομεν</span>] we persuade men, but God we do not need to persuade, like men; to Him we are manifest. The <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πειθ</span>. has been interpreted of the gaining over to Christianity (Beza, Grotius, Er. Schmid, Calovius, Emmerling, and others); or of the apostolic working in general (Ewald); or of the correction of erroneous and offensive opinions regarding Paul (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact); or of the striving to make themselves pleasing to men (Erasmus, Luther, Elsner, Wolf, Hammond, Flatt, and others);[221] or of the <span class="ital">persuadere hominibus nostram integritatem</span> (Estius, Bengel, Semler, Olshausen, de Wette, Osiander, Neander). Billroth also, with quite arbitrary importation of the idea, thinks that <span class="greekheb">πείθομεν</span> is meant of <span class="ital">illegitimate, deceitful persuasion:</span> “I can indeed deceive men, but to God withal I am manifest.” Raphel takes it similarly, but with an interrogative turn. But this assumed meaning of <span class="greekheb">πείθω</span> must of necessity have been given by the context (which is not the case even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm" title="You observe days, and months, and times, and years.">Galatians 4:10</a>); and the idea of <span class="ital">being able</span> would in this view of the meaning be so <span class="ital">essential</span>, that it could not be conveyed in the mere indicative, which, on the contrary, expresses the actually existing state of things, as well as the following <span class="greekheb">πεφανερ</span>. Olshausen erroneously attempts to correct this explanation to the effect of our understanding the expression in reference to the accusations of the opponents: “As our opponents say, we deceitfully persuade men, but before God we are manifest in our purity.” The “as our opponents say” is as arbitrarily invented,[222] as is the conception of deceit in <span class="greekheb">πείθομεν</span>. In defining the object of <span class="greekheb">πείθομεν</span>, the only course warranted by the context is to go back to the immediately preceding self-witness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="Why we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.">2 Corinthians 5:9</a>, <span class="greekheb">φιλοτιμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εὐάρεστοι αὐτῷ εἶναι</span>. <span class="ital">Of this</span> we bring men to the conviction through our teaching and working, not: of the fact, that we <span class="ital">fear the Lord</span> (Zachariae, Rückert), since <span class="greekheb">εἰδότες τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φόβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κυρ</span>. is only of the nature of a motive and a subsidiary thought; hence also not: “<span class="ital">eundem hunc timorem</span> hominibus suademus” (Cornelius a Lapide, Clericus, and others). Comp. Pelagius: “ut caveant;” and again Hofmann: we convince others <span class="ital">of the duty and the right mode of fearing the Lord</span>. After <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπους</span> there is no omission of <span class="greekheb">μέν</span> (Rückert); but the putting of the clause <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πείθ</span>. without indicating its relation makes the following contrast appear surprising and thereby rhetorically more emphati.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ταῖς συνειδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>] Calvin aptly says: “Conscientia enim longius penetrat, quam carnis judicium.” In the <span class="ital">syllogism</span> of the conscience (law of God—act of man—moral judgment on the same) the action of a <span class="ital">third</span> party is here the minor premiss.

It is not the <span class="ital">terror</span> which God inspires, but the <span class="ital">fear</span> which man has of Him that is meant, ‘knowing what it is to fear God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we persuade men</span>] Rather, perhaps, we <span class="bld">win over</span> men. Compare the use of the Greek word here used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm" title="And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.">Acts 12:20</a>. The Apostle is still keeping in mind his object of clearing himself from the unjust accusations brought against him (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>). That the digressions in ch. 3, 4, 5 have not caused him to lose sight of his main object, the vindication of the purity of his motives from the aspersions cast upon them, may be seen by comparing <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2 Corinthians 5:12</a></span> with ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>. Having the fear of God’s judgment continually before his eyes, he persuades men to obey the Gospel of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but we are made manifest unto God</span>] Literally, we <span class="bld">have been</span> made manifest, i.e. we are and have been all along. He knows the purity of our motives, and will one day bear witness to them before all men. See note on last verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">have been</span> made manifest, with the same meaning as above, either (1) ‘by the change (see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a></span>) which our ministry of Christ has produced in your hearts and lives,’ or (2) ‘in your conscientious conviction of our integrity.’ Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2 Corinthians 4:2</a> makes the former the more probable interpretation.

It is the text usually chosen by those who wish to excuse a setting forth of God under the attributes of Moloch. With any such views it has not the remotest connection. It simply means, "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men," either "to keep in view the same fear of the Lord as ourselves," or (reverting to his last assertion of his own sincerity and integrity in ver. 9), "that our sole ambition is to please God." The rendering, "the terror of the Lord," for the every day expression, "the fear of the Lord," was wantonly intruded into modern versions by Beza, and has not a single word to be said in its favour. The phrase means (as always) not the dread which God inspires, but the holy fear which mingles with our love of him. To teach men to regard God with terror is to undo the best teaching of all Scripture, which indeed has too often been the main end of human systems of theology. <span class="accented">We persuade men</span>. Not in a bad sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). The attacks and calumnies of enemies make it necessary to vindicate our integrity is men; but we have no need to do so to God, because he already knows us (comp. "<span class="accented">persuading</span> Blastus," <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We are made manifest unto God;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but to</span> <span class="accented">God we have been</span> (<span class="accented">and are</span>) <span class="accented">manifested</span>.
