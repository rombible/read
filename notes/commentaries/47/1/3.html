He has had a comfort which he recognises as having come from God. The nature of that comfort, as of the previous sorrow, is hardly stated definitely till we come to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.">2Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;">2Corinthians 7:6-7</a>. At present the memory of it leads him to something like a doxology, as being the utterance of a more exulting joy than a simple thanksgiving, such as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;">1Corinthians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Philippians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3</a>. The same formula meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>, where also it expresses a jubilant adoration. Two special names of God are added under the influence of the same feeling. He is “the Father of mercies,” the genitive being possibly a Hebraism, used in place of the cognate adjective; in which case it is identical with “God, the merciful Father,” in Jewish prayers, or with the ever-recurring formula of the Koran, “Allah, the compassionate, the merciful.” It seems better, however, to take the words more literally, as stating that God is the <span class= "ital">originator</span> of all mercies, the source from which they flow. So we have the “Father of lights” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">James 1:17</a>. The precise phrase does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament; but we have the same noun in “the mercies of God” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The God of all comfort.</span>—The latter word, of which, taking the books of the New Testament in their chronological order, this is the earliest occurrence, includes the idea of counsel as well as consolation. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm" title="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,">Acts 4:36</a>.) It is used only by St. Paul, St. Luke, and the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and is pre-eminently characteristic of this Epistle, in which it occurs twelve, or, with the cognate verb, twenty-eight, times.<p>In the balanced structure of the sentence—the order of “God” and “Father” in the first clause being inverted in the second—we may trace something like an unconscious adoption of the familiar parallelism of Hebrew poetry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;...">2 Corinthians 1:3-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Blessed be God, </span>&c. — A solemn and beautiful introduction, highly suitable to the apostolical spirit;

from the joy which the success of the gospel gave him; from the assured hope of the reward which was prepared for him; from his knowledge of the influence of his sufferings to encourage others; and from the enlarged views which he had of the government of God, whereby all things are made to work for good to them who love God;

The Lord is able to give peace to the troubled conscience, and to calm the raging passions of the soul. These blessings are given by him, as the Father of his redeemed family. It is our Saviour who says, Let not your heart be troubled. All comforts come from God, and our sweetest comforts are in him. He speaks peace to souls by granting the free remission of sins; and he comforts them by the enlivening influences of the Holy Spirit, and by the rich mercies of his grace. He is able to bind up the broken-hearted, to heal the most painful wounds, and also to give hope and joy under the heaviest sorrows. The favours God bestows on us, are not only to make us cheerful, but also that we may be useful to others. He sends comforts enough to support such as simply trust in and serve him. If we should be brought so low as to despair even of life, yet we may then trust God, who can bring back even from death. Their hope and trust were not in vain; nor shall any be ashamed who trust in the Lord. Past experiences encourage faith and hope, and lay us under obligation to trust in God for time to come. And it is our duty, not only to help one another with prayer, but in praise and thanksgiving, and thereby to make suitable returns for benefits received. Thus both trials and mercies will end in good to ourselves and others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed be God - This is the commencement properly of the Epistle, and it is the language of a heart that is full of joy, and that bursts forth with gratitude in view of mercy. It may have been excited by the recollection that he had formerly written to them, and that during the interval which had elapsed between the time when the former Epistle was written and when this was penned, he had been called to a most severe trial, and that from that trial he had been mercifully delivered. With a heart full of gratitude and joy for this merciful interposition, he commences this Epistle. It is remarked by Doddridge, that 11 out of the 13 epistles of Paul, begin with exclamations of praise, joy, and thanksgiving. Paul had been afflicted, but he had also been favored with remarkable consolations, and it was not unnatural that he should allow himself to give expression to his joy and praise in view of all the mercies which God had conferred on him. This entire passage is one that is exceedingly valuable, as showing that there may be elevated joy in the midst of deep affliction, and as showing what is the reason why God visits his servants with trials. The phrase "blessed be God," is equivalent to "praised be God;" or is an expression of thanksgiving. It is the usual formula of praise (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>); and shows his entire confidence in God, and his joy in him, and his gratitude for his mercies. it is one of innumerable instances which show that it is possible and proper to bless God in view of the trials with which he visits his people, and of the consolations which he causes to abound.<p>The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ - God is mentioned here in the relation of the "Father of the Lord Jesus," doubtless because it was through the Lord Jesus, and him alone, that He had imparted the consolation which he had experienced, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>. Paul knew no other God than the "Father of the Lord Jesus;" he knew no other source of consolation than the gospel; he knew of no way in which God imparted comfort except through his Son. That is genuine Christian consolation which acknowledges the Lord Jesus as the medium by whom it is imparted; that is proper thanksgiving to God which is offered through the Redeemer; that only is the proper acknowledgment of God which recognizes him as the "Father of the Lord Jesus."<p>The Father of mercies - This is a Hebrew mode of expression, where a noun performs the place of an adjective. and the phrase is synonymous nearly with "merciful Father." The expression has however somewhat more energy and spirit than the simple phrase "merciful Father." The Hebrews used the word "father" often to denote the author, or source of anything; and the idea in phraseology like this is, that mercy proceeds from God, that he is the source of it, and that it is his nature to impart mercy and compassion, as if he originated it; or was the source and fountain of it - sustaining a relation to all true consolation analogous to that which a father sustains to his offspring. God has the paternity of all true joy. It is one of his special and glorious attributes that he thus produces consolation and mercy.<p>And the God of all comfort - The source of all consolation. Paul delighted, as all should do, to trace all his comforts to God; and Paul, as all Christians have, had sufficient reason to regard God as the source of true consolation. There is no other real source of happiness but God; and he is able abundantly, and willing to impart consolation to his people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. This thanksgiving for his late deliverance forms a suitable introduction for conciliating their favorable reception of his reasons for not having fulfilled his promise of visiting them (2Co 1:15-24).<p>Father of mercies&#8212;that is, the SOURCE of all mercies (compare Jas 1:17; Ro 12:1).<p>comfort&#8212;which flows from His "mercies" experienced. Like a true man of faith, he mentions "mercies" and "comfort," before he proceeds to speak of afflictions (2Co 1:4-6). The "tribulation" of believers is not inconsistent with God's mercy, and does not beget in them suspicion of it; nay, in the end they feel that He is "the God of ALL comfort," that is, who imparts the only true and perfect comfort in every instance (Ps 146:3, 5, 8; Jas 5:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is a usual form of thanksgiving, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.

It is in use with us, signifying our sincere and hearty desire that both we ourselves might be enabled, and others by our examples might be quickened, to speak well of God, and to praise his name.

And upon the same account he is also called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the God of all comfort.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Blessed be God,.... This is an ascription of praise and glory to God, for he can only be blessed of men, by their praising and glorifying him, or by ascribing honour and blessing to him: and in this form of blessing him he is described, first by his relation to Christ, <p>even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: whose Son Christ is, not by creation, as angels and men, nor by adoption, as saints, but in such a way of filiation, as no creatures are, or possibly can be: he is his only begotten Son, his own proper Son, his natural and eternal Son, is of the same nature with him, and equal to him in perfections, power, and glory. This is rightly prefaced by the apostle to the other following characters, since there is no mercy nor comfort administered to the sons of men but through the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and Saviour of sinners. And next he is described by his attribute of mercy, and the effects of it, or by his merciful disposition to his creatures, <p>the Father of mercies. The Jews frequently address God in their prayers (a) under the title or character of, , "Father of mercies". The plural number is used, partly to show that God is exceeding merciful; he delights in showing mercy to poor miserable creatures, and is rich and plenteous in the exercise of it: nothing is more common in the Talmudic writings, than to call him  "the merciful", and this is partly to express the multitude of his tender mercies, of which he is the "Father", author, and giver, both in a temporal, and spiritual sense; for there are not only innumerable providential mercies which the people of God share in, and partake of, but also a multitude of spiritual mercies. Such as redemption by Christ, pardon of sin through his blood, regeneration by his Spirit, supplies of grace out of his fulness, and the word and ordinances; all which are owing to the mercy of God, which they have abundant reason to be thankful to him, and bless him for, being altogether unworthy and undeserving of them. God is also described by his work of comforting the saints, <p>and the God of all comfort; most rightly is this character given him, for there is no solid comfort but what comes from him; there is none to be had in, and from the creatures; and whatever is had through them it is from him: and all spiritual comfort is of him; whatever consolation the saints enjoy they have it from God, the Father of Christ, and who is their covenant God and Father in Christ; and the consolation they have from him through Christ in a covenant way is not small, and for which they have great reason to bless the Lord, as the apostle here does; for it is from him that Christ, the consolation of Israel, and the Spirit, the Comforter, come, and whatever is enjoyed by the Gospel. <p>(a) Seder Tephillot, fol. 55. 8.

The mutual interdependence of St Paul and the Corinthian Church<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. <span class="ital">Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>] Two feelings rise at once in the Apostle’s mind. The first is an overwhelming gratitude for his deliverance from his distress, the second the keen sense of his entire unity of heart and soul with the Corinthian Church, and his desire to impart to them whatever blessing he had received from God. Our version follows Wiclif here, substituting, however, <span class="ital">even</span> for <span class="ital">and</span>. The other English versions have <span class="ital">God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>, save the Rhemish, which renders accurately by <span class="ital">the God and Father</span>, &c. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1 Peter 1:3</a> and note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a><span class="ital">the Father of mercies</span>] Either (1), with Chrysostom, the God Whose most inherent attribute is mercy, or (2) the source from whence all mercies proceed. But perhaps the former involves the latter, a sense, however, of which the fact that ‘mercies’ is in the plural forbids us to lose sight. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">James 1:17</a>. Even if we regard the phrase ‘Father of mercies’ as a Hebraism, it is stronger than the expression ‘merciful Father.’ So Estius, “valde multumque misericordem et beneficum.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the God of all comfort</span>] Why does St Paul say ‘the <span class="ital">Father</span> of mercies and the <span class="ital">God</span> of comfort?’ Because the term ‘Father’ implies mercy, suggesting as it does the close and affectionate relation between God and man. See the O. T. <span class="ital">passim</span>, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-13.htm" title="Like as a father pities his children, so the LORD pities them that fear him.">Psalm 103:13</a>. Compare also ‘Our Father which art in heaven.’ God is called ‘the God of comfort’ (see next note) because it comes from Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">comfort</span>] This word, or the verb compounded from it, occurs <span class="ital">ten</span> times in this and the next four verses. In our version, which here follows Tyndale, they are rendered indifferently by <span class="ital">comfort</span> and <span class="ital">consolation</span>, a rendering which considerably lessens the force of the passage. For <span class="ital">consolation</span> the Rhemish substitutes <span class="ital">exhortation</span>, and Wiclif <span class="ital">monestynge</span> (i.e. <span class="ital">admonishing</span>) and <span class="ital">monestid</span>, after the Vulgate, which renders indifferently by <span class="ital">exhortatio</span> and <span class="ital">consolatio</span> here. Perhaps the best words which can be found to express the double meaning of consolation and exhortation conveyed by the Greek are <span class="ital">encourage</span> and <span class="ital">encouragement. Cheer</span> would be more appropriate still had not the noun become almost obsolete. The original sense of the English word (late Latin <span class="ital">confortare</span>) denotes <span class="ital">strengthening</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εὐλογητὸς</span>, <span class="ital">blessed</span>) An elegant mode of introduction, and suited to the apostolic spirit, especially in adversity.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ πατὴρ τῶν οἰκτιρμῶν καὶ Θεὸς πάσης παρακλήσεως</span>, <span class="ital">the Father of mercies and God of all consolation</span>) <span class="ital">Mercies</span> are the fountain of <span class="ital">consolation:</span> comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a> : <span class="greekheb">παρακαλεῖν</span> is <span class="ital">zusprechen, to console</span>. The principle of exhortation and consolation is often them same; <span class="ital">consolation</span> is the proof [the evidence] of <span class="ital">mercies</span>. [<span class="ital">And Paul makes mention of mercies and help, before he mentions afflictions</span>.—V. g.] He exhibits his mercies in the very midst of calamity; and the calamity of the saints is neither contrary to the Divine mercy, nor does it beget suspicion against it in the minds of the saints: afterwards it even affords consolation; therefore <span class="greekheb">πάσης</span>, <span class="ital">of all</span>, is added.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>). This outburst of thanksgiving was meant to repress the relief brought to the overcharged feelings of the apostle by the arrival of Titus, with news respecting the mixed, but on the whole good, effect produced at Corinth by the severe remarks of his first letter. It is characteristic of the intense and impetuous rush of emotion which we often notice in the letters of St. Paul, that he does not here state the special grounds for this impassioned thanksgiving; he only touches upon it for a moment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>, and does not pause to state it fully until <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5-16</a>. It is further remarkable that in this Epistle almost alone he utters no thanksgiving for the moral growth and holiness of the Church to which he is writing. This may be due to the fact that there was still so much to blame; but it more probably arose from the tumult of feeling which throughout this letter disturbs the regular flow of his thoughts. The ordinary "thanksgiving" for his readers is practically, though indirectly, involved in the gratitude which he expresses to God for the sympathy and communion which exists between himself and the Church of Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">Even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The Greek is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, where, literally rendered, it is, "Blessed be the God and Father." The same phrase is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>. The meaning is not, "Blessed be the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (although the expression, "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ," occurs in  <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), but "Blessed be God, who is also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," and who is therefore "our Father" by adoption and redemption, as well as our God by creation. <span class="cmt_word">The Father of mercies.</span> This corresponds to a Hebrew expression, and means that <span class="accented">compassionateness</span> is the most characteristic <span class="accented">attribute of</span> God, and <span class="accented">emanation from</span> him. He is the Source of all mercy; and mercy <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Is an attribute of God himself."</span> He is "full of compassion, and gracious, tong-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a>). "The Law," says the Talmud, "begins and ends with an act of mercy. At its commencement God clothes the naked; at its close be buries the dead" ('Sotah,' f. 14, 1). Thus every chapter but one of the Koran is headed, "In the name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful;" and it is an Eastern expression to say of one that has died that. "he is taken to the mercy of the Merciful." Comp. "Father of glory," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a> ("of spirits," <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-9.htm">Hebrews 12:9</a>; "of lights," <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The plural, "compassions," is perhaps a plural of excellence, "exceeding compassion" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), and may be influenced by the Hebrew word <span class="accented">rachamim</span>, often literally rendered by St. Paul "bowels." The article in the Greek ("the Father of <span class="accented">the</span> compassions") <span class="accented">specializes</span> the mercy. The God of all comfort. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a> God is called "the God of love and peace;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>, "the God of patience and of comfort;" 2:15, "the God of hope." This word "comfort" (unfortunately interchanged with "consolation" in the Authorized Version) and the word "affliction" (varyingly rendered by "trouble" and "tribulation" in the Authorized Version), are the keynotes of this passage; and to some extent of the whole Epistle. St. Paul is haunted as it were and possessed by them. "Comfort," as verb or substantive, occurs ten times in vers. 3-7; and "affliction" occurs four times in succession. It is characteristic of St. Paul's style to be thus dominated, as it were, by a single word (comp. notes on 2 Corinthians 3:2, 13; 4:2; see note on 2 Corinthians 10:8). The needless variations of the Authorized Version were well intentioned, but arose from a false notion of style, a deficient sense of the precision of special words, and an inadequate conception of the duties of faithful translation, which requires that we should as exactly as possible reflect the peculiarities of the original, and not attempt to improve upon them. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The Father of mercies (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Equivalent to the compassionate Father.
