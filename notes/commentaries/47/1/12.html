With the feeling of jubilant thankfulness which has hitherto characterised his language there mingles another of a different character. It had, perhaps, been in the background of his thoughts all along. He had seemed, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1Corinthians 4:21</a>, to imply that he was coming to take strong measures against evil-doers (“Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love?”). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-2.htm" title="On the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.">1Corinthians 16:2-8</a> he had spoken yet more definitely, “I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia.” And yet he had not come. Titus would seem to have told him what was said of this: “He was fickle, and changeable; said Yes one day, and No another. Perhaps he was afraid to come.” He is eager to refute the charge without a formal pleading as in answer to it, and seems to cast about for an opening. He finds it in the words which he had just dictated. He has a right to assume that the Corinthians will pray and give thanks for him, for he can boast that he has never failed, conscience bearing him witness, in transparent sincerity to them.<p><span class= "bld">The testimony of our conscience.</span>—The words present an obviously undesigned coincidence with St. Paul’s language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>, and again with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,">Romans 9:1</a>. To have nothing on his conscience, to “know nothing by (<span class= "ital">i.e., against</span>) himself” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.">1Corinthians 4:4</a>), was the great law of his life. And this was true, as of his whole life in relation to the Corinthians, so especially of the supposed change of purpose with which he had been taunted.<p><span class= "bld">In simplicity.</span>—The better MSS. give “holiness” instead of “simplicity.” The Greek word for the latter is very characteristic of this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-11.htm" title="Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God.">2Corinthians 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-13.htm" title="Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;">2Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2Corinthians 11:3</a>), but then it is used in these passages in quite another sense, as of a single-minded generosity. The word for “holiness” is not a common one, but it appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-10.htm" title="For they truly for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.">Hebrews 12:10</a>. It was, however, the natural correlative of the term “saints” applied to all believers. St. Paul’s conscience told him that he had not been false to the <span class= "ital">consecrated</span> character which that term involved.<p><span class= "bld">Godly sincerity.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">sincerity which is of God.</span> It is seldom satisfactory to tone down the bold vigour of the Greek, or perhaps Hebrew, idiom into the tameness of an English adjective. The sincerity which St. Paul claims had come to him as God’s gift: he could submit it to God’s judgment. The word for “sincerity” (literally, <span class= "ital">transparency of character,</span> or, perhaps, that which bore the test of the strongest light) had been used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1Corinthians 5:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">in</span> or <span class= "ital">with</span> in both clauses. The words indicate the same line of thought as those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.">1Corinthians 2:1-6</a>. Men made invidious comparisons between his plainness of speech and the eloquent wisdom of some other teachers. That kind of “fleshly,” <span class= "ital">i.e., worldly,</span> wisdom he disclaims. It was not that, but the favour or the “grace” of God which was the motive-force of his action, the sphere in which he lived and moved.<p><span class= "bld">We have had our conversation.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">we conducted ourselves.</span> The tense of the Greek verb implies a special reference in thought to the time when he had been at Corinth. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to note that “conversation” means “conduct,” but as the first occurrence of the word in the New Testament, it may be well to trace the several stages through which it has passed. On its appearance in English, as in Chaucer, it has its full etymological force as indicating, as it does here, habitual conduct. “Enquire of his <span class= "ital">conversation</span> and of his life before” (<span class= "ital">Tale of Melibœus</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> So in Wiclif’s version of the Bible it is used, as in that of 1611, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm" title="For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:">Galatians 1:13</a>. In somewhat later writers, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in Sidney and Strype, the sense becomes that of “conduct <span class= "ital">with</span> others,” “converse, intercourse,” a sense still prominent in the familiar legal term for adultery. In Swift and Cowper it has come to be all but absolutely identified with the intercourse which is carried on by talking. In its fullest sense, the Apostle can say that he had striven to <span class= "ital">live</span> everywhere so as to avoid giving grounds for suspicion. Nowhere had he been more careful so to live than at Corinth, where men were suspicious in proportion to their own viciousness. (Comp.

"I have a just cause of rejoicing, and it is, that I have endeavored to live a life of simplicity and godly sincerity, and have not been actuated by the principles of worldly wisdom." The connection here is not very obvious, and it is not quite easy to trace it. Most expositors, as Doddridge, Locke, Macknight, Bloomfield, etc., suppose that he mentions the purity of his life as a reason why he had a right to expect their prayers, as he had requested in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-11.htm">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>. They would not doubt, it is supposed, that his life had been characterized by great simplicity and sincerity, and would feel, therefore, a deep interest in his welfare, and be disposed to render thanks that be had been preserved in the day of peril. But the whole context and the scope of the passage is rather to be taken into view. Paul had been exposed to death.<p>He had no hope of life. Then the ground of his rejoicing, and of his confidence, was that he had lived a holy life. He had not been actuated by "fleshly wisdom," but he had been animated and guided by "the grace of God." His aim had been simple, his purpose holy, and he had the testimony of his conscience that his motives had been right, and he had, therefore, no concern about the result. A good conscience, a holy life through Jesus Christ, will enable a man always to look calmly on death. What has a Christian to fear in death? Paul had kept a good conscience toward all; but he says that he had special and unique joy that he had done it toward the Corinthians. This he says, because many there had accused him of fickleness, and of disregard for their interests. He declares, therefore, that even in the prospect of death he had a consciousness of rectitude toward them, and proceeds to show <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-13.htm">2 Corinthians 1:13-23</a> that the charge against him was not well founded. I regard this passage, therefore, as designed to express the fact that Paul, in view of sudden death, had a consciousness of a life of piety, and was comforted with the reflection that he had not been actuated by the "fleshly wisdom" of the world.<p>The testimony of our conscience - An approving conscience. It does not condemn me on the subject. Though others might accuse him, though his name might be calumniated, yet he had comfort in the approval which his own conscience gave to his course. Paul's conscience was enlightened, and its decisions were correct. Whatever others might charge him with he knew what had been the aim and purpose of his life; and the consciousness of upright aims, and of such plans as the "grace of God" would prompt to, sustained him. An approving conscience is of inestimable value when we are calumniated; and when we draw near to death.<p>That in simplicity - (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;  en haplote&#772;ti.) Tyndale renders this forcibly "without doubleness." The word means sincerity, candor, probity, plain-heartedness, Christian simplicity, frankness, integrity; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>. It stands opposed to double-dealings and purposes; to deceitful appearances, and crafty plans; to mere policy, and craftiness in accomplishing an object. A man under the influence of this, is straightforward, candid, open, frank; and he expects to accomplish his purpose by integrity and fair-dealing, and not by stratagem and cunning. Policy, craft, artful plans, and deep-laid schemes of deceit belong to the world; simplicity of aim and purpose are the true characteristics of a real Christian.<p>And godly sincerity - Greek "sincerity of God." This may be a Hebrew idiom, by which the superlative degree is indicated, when, in order to express the highest degree, they added the name of God, as in the phrases "mountains of God," signifying the highest mountains, or "cedars of God," denoting lofty cedars. Or it may mean such sincerity as God manifests and approves such as he, by his grace, would produce in the heart; such as the religion of the gospel is suited to produce. The word used here, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  heilikrineia, and rendered sincerity, denotes. properly, clearness, such as is judged of or discerned in sunshine (from &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;  heile&#772; and &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  krino&#772;), and thence pureness, integrity. It is most probable that the phrase here denotes that sincerity which God produces and approves; and the sentiment is, that pure religion, the religion of God, produces entire sincerity in the heart. Its purposes and aims are open and manifest, as if seen in the sunshine. The plans of the world are obscure, deceitful, and dark, as if in the night.<p>Not with fleshly wisdom - Not with the wisdom which is manifested by the people of this world; not by the principles of cunning, and mere policy, and expediency, which often characterize them. The phrase here stands opposed to simplicity and sincerity, to openness and straightforwardness. And Paul means to disclaim for himself, and for his fellow-laborers, all that carnal policy which distinguishes the mere people of the world. And if Paul deemed such policy improper for him, we should deem it improper for us; if he had no plans which he wished to advance by it, we should have none; if he would not employ it in the promotion of good plans, neither should we. It has been the curse of the church and the bane of religion; and it is to this day exerting a withering and blighting influence on the church. The moment that such plans are resorted to, it is proof that the vitality of religion is gone, and any man who feels that his purposes cannot be accomplished but by such carnal policy, should set it down as full demonstration that his plans are wrong, and that his purpose should be abandoned.<p>But by the grace of God - This phrase stands opposed, evidently, to "fleshly wisdom." It means that Paul had been influenced by such sentiments and principles as would be suggested or prompted by the influence of his grace. Locke renders it, "by the favor of God directing me." God had shown him favor; God had directed him; and he had kept him from the crooked and devious ways of mere worldly policy. The idea seems to be not merely that he had pursued a correct and upright course of life, but that he was indebted for this to the mere grace and favor of God, an idea which Paul omitted no opportunity of acknowledging.<p>We have had our conversation - We have conducted ourselves &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  anastraphe&#772;men. The word used here means literally, "to turn up, to overturn"; then "to turn back, to return," and in the middle voice, "to turn oneself around, to turn oneself to anything, and, also, to move about in, to live in, to be conversant with, to conduct oneself." In this sense it seems to be used here; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-18.htm">Hebrews 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-17.htm">1 Peter 1:17</a>. The word "conversation," we usually apply to oral discourse, but in the Scriptures, it means "conduct," and the sense of the passage is, that Paul had conducted himself in accordance with the principles of the grace of God, and had been influenced by that.<p>In the world - Everywhere; whereever I have been. This does not mean in the world as contradistinguished from the church, but in the world at large, or wherever he had been, as contradistinguished from the church at Corinth. It had been his common and universal practice.<p>And more abundantly to you-ward - Especially toward you. This was added doubtless because there had been charges against him in Corinth, that he had been crafty, cunning, deceitful, and especially that he had deceived them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>), in not visiting them as he had promised. He affirms, therefore, that in all things he had acted in the manner to which the grace of God prompted, and that his conduct, in all respects, had been that of entire simplicity and sincerity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. For&#8212;reason why he may confidently look for their prayers for him.<p>our rejoicing&#8212;Greek, "our glorying." Not that he glories in the testimony of his conscience, as something to boast of; nay, this testimony is itself the thing in which his glorying consists.<p>in simplicity&#8212;Most of the oldest manuscripts read, "in holiness." English Version reading is perhaps a gloss from Eph 6:5 [Alford]. Some of the oldest manuscripts and versions, however, support it.<p>godly sincerity&#8212;literally, "sincerity of God"; that is, sincerity as in the presence of God (1Co 5:8). We glory in this in spite of all our adversities. Sincerity in Greek implies the non-admixture of any foreign element. He had no sinister or selfish aims (as some insinuated) in failing to visit them as he had promised: such aims belonged to his adversaries, not to him (2Co 2:17). "Fleshly wisdom" suggests tortuous and insincere courses; but the "grace of God," which influenced him by God's gifts (Ro 12:3; 15:15), suggests holy straightforwardness and sincere faithfulness to promises (2Co 1:17-20), even as God is faithful to His promises. The prudence which subserves selfish interests, or employs unchristian means, or relies on human means more than on the Divine Spirit, is "fleshly wisdom."<p>in the world&#8212;even in relation to the world at large, which is full of disingenuousness.<p>more abundantly to you-ward&#8212;(2Co 2:4). His greater love to them would lead him to manifest, especially to them, proofs of his sincerity, which his less close connection with the world did not admit of his exhibiting towards it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He declareth the confidence that he had, that he should not want their prayers, because his own heart told him, to his joy and satisfaction, that however others might reproach him, as if he had carried himself deceitfully, or craftily, yet he had not done so, but had lived in the world in all <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">simplicity and sincerity of God</span> (so the Greek is). Simplicity is opposed to double-mindedness; where there is a composition in a man, a mixture of truth and falsehood, fairness in speech and falsehood in heart or action. Sincerity is opposed to hypocrisy. It is said to be of God, because he is the God of truth, hath commanded it, approveth it, worketh it, and disposeth the heart of man to it.

This rejoicing or glorying of the apostle's in the testimony of their consciences, to the goodness of their hearts, actions, conduct, and behaviour, was not before God, and in his sight, but before men, who were ready to accuse their good conversation in Christ: nor are these words to be considered as they generally are by interpreters, as if it was the testimony of a good conscience, which was the ground of their faith and confidence, that God would deliver them, and was an helping cause, together with the prayers of the saints, of their present deliverance.

The fact that, in spite of all his exceptional care, such bitter taunts could still be levelled at him, shows that he had not been mistaken in supposing that no Church required from him a more anxious watchfulness over all his conduct. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Godly sincerity (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Lit., sincerity of God, as Rev.
