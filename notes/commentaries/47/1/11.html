Indirectly he asks their prayers for him, but he does so with a refined delicacy of feeling, by assuming that they are already praying, and that their prayers are helpful.<p><span class= "bld">That for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons.</span>—The Greek word for “person” (<span class= "ital">prosôpon</span>) is elsewhere throughout the New Testament translated “face” or “countenance,” or “person” in the sense of “outward appearance.” It has been suggested that that may be its meaning <span class= "ital">even</span> here: <span class= "ital">that thanksgiving may be offered from many upturned faces.</span> The use of the word <span class= "ital">prosopopœia,</span> however, for “personifying,” and of <span class= "ital">prosôpon</span> for the characters in a drama, indicates that the noun was beginning to be used in a different sense, and this must clearly have been well established when it came to be used in theological language for the three “persons” of the Godhead. It is interesting to note, however, as a fact in the history of language, that, if this be its meaning here, it is probably one of the earliest extant instances of its being so used.<p>The “gift,” in this instance, is the deliverance from danger and suffering spoken of in the previous verse. Safety and health deserved the name not less truly than prophecy and the gift of tongues. He assumes, with the same subtle refinement as before, that they will be as ready to give thanks for his recovery or deliverance as they were to pray for it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 We are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. The Lord is able to give peace to the troubled conscience, and to calm the raging passions of the soul. These blessings are given by him, as the Father of his redeemed family. It is our Saviour who says, Let not your heart be troubled. All comforts come from God, and our sweetest comforts are in him. He speaks peace to souls by granting the free remission of sins; and he comforts them by the enlivening influences of the Holy Spirit, and by the rich mercies of his grace. He is able to bind up the broken-hearted, to heal the most painful wounds, and also to give hope and joy under the heaviest sorrows. The favours God bestows on us, are not only to make us cheerful, but also that we may be useful to others. He sends comforts enough to support such as simply trust in and serve him. If we should be brought so low as to despair even of life, yet we may then trust God, who can bring back even from death. Their hope and trust were not in vain; nor shall any be ashamed who trust in the Lord. Past experiences encourage faith and hope, and lay us under obligation to trust in God for time to come. And it is our duty, not only to help one another with prayer, but in praise and thanksgiving, and thereby to make suitable returns for benefits received. Thus both trials and mercies will end in good to ourselves and others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye also helping together by prayer for us - Tyndale renders this in connection with the close of the previous verse; "we trust that yet hereafter he will deliver us, by the help of your prayer for us." The word rendered "helping together," means cooperating, aiding, assisting; and the idea is, that Paul felt that his trials might be turned to good account, and give occasion for thanksgiving; and that this was to be accomplished by the aid of the prayers of his fellow Christians. He felt that the church was one, and that Christians should sympathize with one another. He evinced deep humility and tender regard for the Corinthians when he called on them to aid him by their prayers. Nothing would be better calculated to excite their tender affection and regard than thus to call on them to sympathize with him in his trials, and to pray that those trials might result in thanksgiving throughout the churches.<p>That for the gift bestowed upon us - The sentence which occurs here is very perplexing in the original, and the construction is difficult. But the main idea is not difficult to he seen. The "gift" here referred to (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  to charisma)  means doubtless the favor shown to him in his rescue from so imminent a peril; and he felt that this was owing to the prayers of many persons on his behalf He believed that he had been remembered in the petitions of his friends and fellow Christians, and that his deliverance was owing to their supplications.<p>By the means of many persons -  Probably meaning that the favor referred to had been imparted by means of the prayers of many individuals who had taken a deep interest in his welfare. But it may also imply perhaps that he had been directly assisted, and had been rescued from the impending danger by the interposition of many friends who had come to his relief. The usual interpretation is, however, that it was by the prayers of many in his behalf.<p>Thanks may be given by many on our behalf - Many may be induced also to render thanks for my deliverance. The idea is, that as he had been delivered from great peril by the prayers of many persons, it was proper also that thanksgiving should be offered by as many in his behalf, or on account of his deliverance. "Mercies that have been obtained by prayer should be acknowledged by praise" - Doddridge. God had mercifully interposed in answer to the prayers of his people; and it was proper that his mercy should be as extensively acknowledged. Paul was desirous that God should not be forgotten: and that those who had sought his deliverance should render praise to God, perhaps intimating here that those who had obtained mercies by prayer are prone to forget their obligation to return thanks to God for his gracious and merciful interposition. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. helping together by prayer for us&#8212;rather, "helping together on our behalf by your supplication"; the words "for us" in the Greek following "helping together," not "prayer."<p>that for the gift, &c.&#8212;literally, "That on the part of many persons the gift (literally, 'gift of grace'; the mercy) bestowed upon us by means of (that is, through the prayers of) many may be offered thanks for (may have thanks offered for it) on our behalf."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye also helping together by prayer for us:</span> faith ought; not to hinder prayer; nor doth God’s principal efficiency, as to any mercy or deliverance bestowed upon us, give a <span class="ital">supersedeas</span> to us, as to the use of any means, whether natural or spiritual, by which the mercy may be obtained.

Though the apostle ascribes their deliverance solely to God, as the author and efficient cause of it; yet he takes notice of the prayers of the saints for them, as helping causes or means of their obtaining it. It was a very laudable practice in the churches, and worthy of imitation, to pray for the ministers of the Gospel, and especially when under affliction and persecution; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a>, and the prayers of those righteous ones were heard by God, and often effectual for the deliverance of them, as they were in the present case: for <p>by the means of many persons, who wrestled together in prayer with God, <p>the gift of deliverance from so great a death, which the apostle looked upon as a wonderful mercy,  "a free grace gift", was "bestowed upon" them, which was granted for this end, <p>that thanks may be given by many on our behalf; which is but reasonable, and ought to be observed; for since many were concerned in asking for, and obtaining the mercy, they ought to join in thanksgiving for it: and the apostle's view in this is to stir them up to a joint acknowledgment of the deliverance with them, which better became them than to side with the false apostles in their charge against him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Ye also helping together by prayer for us, <span class="cverse3">{7}</span> that for the gift <i>bestowed</i> upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</span><p>(6) That he may not seem to boast of himself, he attributes all to God, and in so doing also confesses that he attributes much to the prayers of the faithful.<p>(7) The end of the afflictions of the saints is the glory of God, and therefore they ought to be precious to us.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>.

A transposition for <span class="greekheb">τῇ δεήσει ὑπὲρ ἡμ</span>. would indeed be grammatically possible (Bernhardy, p. 461), but is in the highest degree superfluous (in opposition to Erasmus, Grotius, Schulz, Rosenmüller).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἐκ πολλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] divinely-appointed aim of the <span class="greekheb">συνυπουργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The correlations are to be noted: 1. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πολλῶν προσώπ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">τὸ εἰς ἡμᾶς χάρ</span>.; 2. <span class="greekheb">διὰ πολλῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν</span>; 3. <span class="greekheb">χάρισμα</span> and <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστηθῇ</span>. Accordingly, there stand parallel to one another <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πολλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπ</span>. and then <span class="greekheb">διὰ πολλῶν</span>; as also <span class="greekheb">τὸ εἰς ἡμᾶς χάρισμα</span> and then <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν</span>. Hence, it is to be connected and taken thus: <span class="ital">that from many countenances for the gift of grace made to us thanks may be rendered by means of many on our behalf</span>. Paul means that the thanksgiving for <span class="ital">his</span> (and Timothy’s) <span class="ital">rescue</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸ εἰς ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάρ</span>.[126]) is not to be offered to God by himself (and Timothy) alone, but that it is to be a rendering of thanks made for him by many through the mediation of many. The <span class="ital">many</span> are the <span class="ital">same</span> in <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πολλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπ</span>. as in <span class="greekheb">διὰ πολλῶν</span>; but there they are conceived of as those who <span class="ital">give thanks</span>, and in <span class="greekheb">διὰ π</span>. it. as those who have been <span class="ital">the procuring means of the thanksgiving</span>, in so far as <span class="ital">through their prayer they have aided in obtaining the apostle’s rescue</span>.[127] <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον</span>, according to the use of the later Greek (see Lobeck, <span class="ital">ad Phryn.</span> p. 380; Schweigh., <span class="ital">Lex. Polyb.</span> p. 540; Wahl, <span class="ital">Clav. Apocr.</span> p. 430), is taken as <span class="ital">person</span> by Luther and most others (already in codd. of the Italic version). But it is nowhere used thus in the N. T., not even in passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>; and, if Paul had had <span class="ital">person</span> in mind, there would have been no motive for choosing <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΌ</span></span></span>. Hence we must abide by the literal signification, <span class="ital">countenance</span> (Billroth, Ewald, Osiander, Hofmann): the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πολλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπ</span>. is <span class="ital">pictorial</span>, for on the merry countenance the feeling of gratitude is displayed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-30.htm" title="The light of the eyes rejoices the heart: and a good report makes the bones fat.">Proverbs 15:30</a>); it is mirrored therein, and goes out from it and upward to God in the utterance of thanksgiving. Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom.</span> III. p. 53, in the same way rightly joins <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πολλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπ</span>. as well as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΠΟΛΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὐΧΑΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, but he takes <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ ΠΟΛΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> of those who have besought the rescue and have thereby become the causers of the thanksgiving, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΠΟΛΛῶΝ</span></span></span> of the thanksgivers themselves. So also Neander. But by this view justice is not done to the <span class="ital">mediating</span> sense of <span class="greekheb">διά</span>, and the <span class="ital">pictorial</span> reference of <span class="greekheb">προσώπων</span> (see above) can, according to the text, be found only in the act of thanksgiving itself. It is obvious from what has already been said, that neither can <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΠΟΛΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> be joined to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΕἸς ἩΜ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΧΆΡΙΣΜΑ</span></span></span> (Theophylact and others, Billroth, Olshausen, Osiander, Kling), nor can <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ ΠΟΛΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΡΟΣΏΠ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> be connected with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΕἸς ἩΜ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΧΆΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> as if it stood: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ἘΚ ΠΟΛΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΡΟΣΏΠ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΕἸς ἩΜᾶς ΧΆΡΙΣΜΑ</span></span></span> (Ambrosiaster, Valla, Beza, Calvin, Grotius, Estius, and many others, including Flatt, Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Diss.</span>, Rückert, de Wette). Only on our view does the simple construction, as given by the order of the words, remain without dislocation, and the meaning of the words themselves uninjured. Whether, further, in <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πολλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπ</span>. the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΛΛῶΝ</span></span></span> is <span class="ital">masculine</span> (Hofmann and Vulgate, “ex <span class="ital">multorum</span> facie”) or <span class="ital">neuter</span>, cannot be decide.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν</span>] <span class="ital">on our behalf</span>, superfluous in itself, but suitable to the fulness of the representation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">time</span> in which the thanksgiving is to happen is after the beginning of the <span class="greekheb">ῥύσεται</span>, not on the last day (Ewald).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passive expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὐΧΑΡΙΣΤΕῖΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> (comp. Hipp. <span class="ital">Ep.</span> p. 1284, 31) is conceived like <span class="greekheb">ἀχαριστεῖσθαι</span> (Polyb. xxiii. 11. 8), to experience ingratitude, to be recompensed with ingratitude. Comp. Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut. Gr.</span> p. 130 [E. T. 148].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[126] Not the <span class="ital">apostolic office</span> (Ewald, Osiander), which here lies far from the context. So also Hofmann: the gift of God, to preach Christ to those who do not yet know Him. In the ordinary interpretation, there was not the least need of a demonstrative: the article and <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἡμᾶς</span> is from the context demonstrative enough.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[127] It was quite unsuitable, and contrary to the construction purposely carried out by the <span class="ital">correlate</span> stated above, to take <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πολλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">διὰ πολλ</span>. as <span class="ital">neuter</span>, and either to explain the former, <span class="ital">ex multis respectibus</span> (Bengel, comp. Melanchthon—not even justifiable in the usage of the language), or the latter, <span class="ital">prolixe</span> (Castalio: “ingentes gratiae,” Wolf, Clericus, Semler, Storr, Rosenmüller). Comp. Luther. So also Hofmann takes <span class="greekheb">διὰ πολλ</span>. “<span class="ital">abundant</span> thanksgiving.” The Vulgate renders rightly: “per multos.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">συνυπουργούντων καὶ ὑμῶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; i.e.</span>, apparently, “helping <span class="ital">me</span>”.
