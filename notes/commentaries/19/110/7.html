Such is undoubtedly the meaning of this verse, and we need not suppose a sudden change of subject, as some critics do, as if the picture representing a thirsty warrior were unworthy of Jehovah. Poetry knows nothing of such timidity, and with the grand scene of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength?

This is the more general interpretation of the verse. It expresses, says Poole, “the humiliation and passion of the Messiah, to prevent a great mistake which might arise in men’s minds concerning him, from the great successes and victories here ascribed to him, which might induce them to think that he should be exempted from all sufferings, and be crowned with constant and perpetual triumphs. To confute this notion, he signifies here that the Messiah should have a large portion of afflictions while he was in the way or course of his life, before he should come to his end or rest, and to the honour of sitting at his Father’s right hand.” Thus St. Paul, who may be considered as giving a comment on these words, observes, that <span class="ital">being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto</span> <span class="ital">death, wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, </span>&c., <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross....">Php 2:8-9</a>. Waters in Scripture very frequently signify sufferings; and to <span class="ital">drink of </span>them signifies to feel or bear these sufferings. There are some, however, who give the verse a different meaning, and suppose that by <span class="ital">drinking of the brook in the way, </span>is meant the succour and supply of almighty grace: or, the influences of the Holy Spirit, frequently represented under the emblem of water, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-3.htm" title="Therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of salvation.">Isaiah 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-38.htm" title="He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water....">John 7:38-39</a>. Thus Mr. Hervey: “If it be asked, how the Redeemer shall be enabled to execute the various and important offices foretold in the former part of this Psalm, the prophet replies, <span class="ital">He shall drink of the brook in the way. </span>He shall not be left barely to his human nature, which must unavoidably sink, but through the whole administration of his mediatorial kingdom, and his incarnate state, shall be supported with omnipotent succours. He shall drink of the brook of almighty power: he shall be continually supported by the influence of the Holy Spirit, <span class="ital">and therefore shall he lift up his head. </span>By these means shall he be rendered equal to his prodigious task, superior to all opposition, successful in whatever he undertakes, and greatly triumphant over all his enemies.” — <span class="ital">Hervey’s Med., </span>vol. 1. p. 129.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Upon the whole, we have in this Psalm as clear a prophecy of the Messiah, and of the offices which he should sustain, as perhaps we can find, in so few words, in any part of the Old Testament, and a prophecy absolutely incapable of any other application. Now this prophecy was completely fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth, when he rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and sat down on the right hand of his Father; from <span class="ital">thenceforth expecting till his enemies should be made his footstool; </span>that is, “till Satan, the prince of this world, should be confined to the bottomless pit; till all the persecuting powers of it should be destroyed, and till death and the grave should be no more, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>.

The laws of his kingdom are the laws of the gospel; which were to be published from Jerusalem: they who freely offered themselves to publish his laws, and gather subjects into his kingdom, were the apostles, and first preachers of his word; who, in a few years, being invested with power from on high, spread his gospel over the world, and gathered into his kingdom multitudes of subjects out of every nation under heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm" title="Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.">Psalm 110:3</a>. At the same time that Jesus was seated on his throne as King, he was made High-Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, to intercede for his people, and be their advocate with the Father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>. The sceptre was given him as well for the destruction of his enemies, as the protection of his subjects. When, therefore, the potentates of the earth opposed his gospel, and persecuted its publishers, he destroyed them with the breath of his mouth; first, by pouring out his wrath on Judea, in the excision of its inhabitants, and the subversion of its state; and afterward, by executing his vengeance on the persecuting powers of the heathen world, as they rose up to oppose the advancement of his kingdom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/110-5.htm" title="The Lord at your right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath....">Psalm 110:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war....">Revelation 19:11-21</a>. When Jesus set out on his warfare against the enemies of our salvation, he drank deep of the cup of sorrow and suffering; but, in reward for his humiliation, he is highly exalted to the throne of equal glory, at the right hand of God, that <span class="ital">all should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father:” </span>see Green, on the Prayer of Habakkuk. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/110.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>110:1-7 Christ's kingdom. - Glorious things are here spoken of Christ. Not only he should be superior to all the kings of the earth, but he then existed in glory as the eternal Son of God. Sitting is a resting posture: after services and sufferings, to give law, to give judgment. It is a remaining posture: he sits like a king for ever. All his enemies are now in a chain, but not yet made his footstool. And his kingdom, being set up, shall be kept up in the world, in despite of all the powers of darkness. Christ's people are a willing people. The power of the Spirit, going with the power of the world, to the people of Christs, is effectual to make them willing. They shall attend him in the beautiful attire of holiness; which becomes his house for ever. And he shall have many devoted to him. The dew of our youth, even in the morning of our days, ought to be consecrated to our Lord Jesus. Christ shall not only be a King, but a Priest. He is God's Minister to us, and our Advocate with the Father, and so is the Mediator between God and man. He is a Priest of the order of Melchizedek, which was before that of Aaron, and on many accounts superior to it, and a more lively representation of Christ's priesthood. Christ's sitting at the right hand of God, speaks as much terror to his enemies as happiness to his people. The effect of this victory shall be the utter ruin of his enemies. We have here the Redeemer saving his friends, and comforting them. He shall be humbled; he shall drink of the brook in the way. The wrath of God, running in the curse of the law, may be considered as the brook in the way of his undertaking. Christ drank of the waters of affliction in his way to the throne of glory. But he shall be exalted. What then are we? Has the gospel of Christ been to us the power of God unto salvation? Has his kingdom been set up in our hearts? Are we his willing subjects? Once we knew not our need of his salvation, and we were not willing that he should reign over us. Are we willing to give up every sin, to turn from a wicked, insnaring world, and rely only on his merits and mercy, to have him for our Prophet, Priest, and King? and do we desire to be holy? To those who are thus changed, the Saviour's sacrifice, intercession, and blessing belong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/110.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall drink of the brook in the way - The design here seems to be to represent the Messiah as a victorious king and conqueror pursuing his enemies. In the previous verse the psalmist had represented him under the image of one engaged in battle, and slaying his enemies with a great slaughter. He here represents him as pursuing those who should escape from the battle, and as pursuing them without fainting or exhaustion. He is like one who finds abundant springs and streams of water in his journeyings; who refreshes himself at those fountains and streams; who, therefore, is not faint and weary. He pursues his foes vigorously and with success.<p>Therefore shall he lift up the head - Therefore shall he triumph, or be successful. The head falls when we are faint and exhausted, when we are disappointed and are ashamed, when we are conscious of guilt. It is lifted up in conscious rectitude, in success and triumph, in the exuberance of hope. The idea here is, that the Messiah would be triumphant. He would achieve the victory over all his foes; he would pursue, without exhaustion, his flying enemies, and he would return from the conquest joyous, exulting, triumphant. All this is under the image of a victorious hero; all this will be accomplished in the conquest of the world by the Gospel; in the subduing of the foes of God; in the final scene when the Redeemer shall deliver up the kingdom to God. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/110.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. As a conqueror, "faint, yet pursuing" [Jud 8:4], He shall be refreshed by the brook in the way, and pursue to completion His divine and glorious triumphs.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/110.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He shall drink of the brook in the way:</span> this may be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Properly, to express the fervency and diligence of the Messias in the prosecution of his business; who having routed and destroyed the main body of his enemies’ forces, pursues those that fled with such eagerness, that he will not lose any time in refreshing himself, as might seem necessary after such hot and hard service, but will content himself with drinking a little water out of the brook which he finds in his way, that being a little refreshed therewith he may proceed with more rigour and efficacy in his work. And so this place alludes to the history of Gideon’s three hundred men, who only lapped a little of the water; of whom see <span class="bld">Judges 7</span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Metaphorically, to express the humiliation and passion of the Messias, and thereby to prevent a great mistake which might arise in men’s minds concerning him, from the great successes and victories here ascribed to him, which might induce them to think that the Messias should be exempted from all sufferings, and be crowned with constant and perpetual triumphs. To confute this conceit, he intimates here that the Messias, before he should obtain that power and glory mentioned in the foregoing verses, should have a large portion of afflictions in the way to it, or whilst he was in the way or course of his life, before he came to his end or rest, and to that honour of sitting at his Father’s right hand. <span class="ital">Waters</span> in Scripture do very frequently signify afflictions or sufferings, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm" title="Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterspouts: all your waves and your billows are gone over me.">Psalm 42:7</a></span>, &c. <span class="ital">To drink</span> of them, signifies to feel or bear them, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a> 49:12 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask.

This some understand of the sufferings of Christ, compared to a brook, a flow of waters, because of the abundance of them, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1</a>, his partaking of which is sometimes expressed by drinking, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a> and this was in the way of working out the salvation of his people, and in his own way to glory, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>. If this is the sense, there may be some allusion to the black brook Kidron; over which David, the type of Christ, passed when in distress; and over which Christ himself went into the garden, where his sorrows began, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>, but seeing this clause stands surrounded with others, which only speak of his victories, triumph, and exaltation, it seems to require a sense agreeable to them; wherefore those interpreters seem nearer to the truth of the text, who explain it of Christ's victory over all enemies, sin, Satan, the world, and death; and illustrate it by the passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>, "he shall drink of the blood of the slain"; with which compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>. Others think the allusion is to the eagerness of a general pursuing a routed army, and pushing on his conquest; who, though almost choked with thirst, yet will not stop to refresh himself; but meeting with a brook or rivulet of water by the way, takes a draught of it, and hastens his pursuit of the enemy: and so this is expressive of, the eagerness of Christ to finish the great work of man's salvation, and the conquest of all his and their enemies; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>. But I think the clause is rather expressive of the solace, joy, and comfort, which Christ, as man, has in the presence of God, and at his right hand, having finished the work of our salvation; then he drank to his refreshment of the river of divine pleasure, when God showed him the path of life, and raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, and introduced him into his presence; where are fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>. <p>Therefore shall he lift up the head; as he did at his resurrection; he bowed it when he died, he lifted it up when he rose again, and so when he ascended on high to his God and Father; when he took his place at his right hand; where his head is lifted up above his enemies, and where he is exalted above angels, principalities, and powers, and where he must reign till all enemies are put under his feet. Or, "so shall he lift up his head", as Noldius (d) renders it; not that his sufferings, which he understands by "drinking out of the brook", were the cause of his exaltation, but the consequent of it: these two, Christ's humiliation and exaltation, though they are sometimes joined together, yet not as cause and effect, but as the antecedent and consequent; Christ having finished what, according to the divine order was to be finished, glory followed by the same order: and so the words thus taken respect not the cause, but the constitution of things, according to that writer. <p>(d) Concord.

That such language should be imitated in the Psalms of Solomon (17:23ff.), in an age which looked for a conquering king as its Messianic ideal, is not to be wondered at. The passage is worth quoting for the sake of its contrast as well as its resemblance to this Psalm and Psalms 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Behold, O Lord, and raise up for them their king, the son of David, in the time which thou knowest, O God,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That he may reign over Israel thy servant;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And gird him with strength to break in pieces unrighteous rulers;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To cleanse Jerusalem from the heathen that trample it down and destroy it,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In wisdom and in righteousness;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To thrust out sinners from the inheritance,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To break in pieces the arrogance of the sinners,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To shatter all their substance as a potter’s vessels with a rod of iron.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To destroy the lawless nations with the word of his mouth,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That the nations may flee from him at his rebuke,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And to punish sinners in the imagination of their heart.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A translation of the Targum is subjoined.

The former does not favour it, for it is indeed correct that the subject calls his king "my lord," e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-12.htm">1 Samuel 22:12</a>, although the more exact form of address is "my lord the king," e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-9.htm">1 Samuel 24:9</a>; but if the people are speaking here, what is the object of the title of honour being expressed as if coming from the mouth of an individual, and why not rather, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20.htm">Psalm 20-21</a>, &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; or &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;? &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is, however, decisive against the supposition that it is an Israelite who here expresses himself concerning the relation of his king to Jahve. For it is absurd to suppose that an Israelite speaking in the name of the people would begin in the manner of the prophets with &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, more particularly since this &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1492; placed thus at the head of the discourse is without any perfectly analogous example (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a> are only similar) elsewhere, and is therefore extremely important. In general this opening position of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, even in cases where other genitives that &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; follow, is very rare; &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15</a>, of David in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>, of Agur in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>, and always (even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-2.htm">Psalm 36:2</a>) in an oracular signification. Moreover, if one from among the people were speaking, the declaration ought to be a retrospective glance at a past utterance of God. But, first, the history knows nothing of any such divine utterance; and secondly, &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1492; always introduces God as actually speaking, to which even the passage cited by Hofmann to the contrary, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28</a>, forms no exception. Thus it will consequently not be a past utterance of God to which the poet glances back here, but one which David has just now heard &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-43.htm">Matthew 22:43</a>), and is therefore not a declaration of the people concerning David, but of David concerning Christ. The unique character of the declaration confirms this. Of the king of Israel it is said that he sits on the throne of Jahve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>), viz., as visible representative of the invisible King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>); Jahve, however, commands the person here addressed to take his place at His right hand. The right hand of a king is the highest place of honour, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>.<p>(Note: Cf. the custom of the old Arabian kings to have their viceroy (ridf) sitting at their right hand, Monumenta antiquiss. hist. Arabum, ed. Eichhorn, p. 220.)<p>Here the sitting at the right hand signifies not merely an idle honour, but reception into the fellowship of God as regards dignity and dominion, exaltation to a participation in God's reigning (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>). Just as Jahve sits enthroned in the heavens and laughs at the rebels here below, so shall he who is exalted henceforth share this blessed calm with Him, until He subdues all enemies to him, and therefore makes him the unlimited, universally acknowledged ruler. &#1506;&#1491; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>, for &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; or &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, does not exclude the time that lies beyond, but as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/112-8.htm">Psalm 112:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, includes it, and in fact so that it at any rate marks the final subjugation of the enemies as a turning-point with which something else comes about (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>). &#1492;&#1491;&#1501; is an accusative of the predicate. The enemies shall come to lie under his feet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>), his feet tread upon the necks of the vanquished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>), so that the resistance that is overcome becomes as it were the dark ground upon which the glory of his victorious rule arises. For the history of time ends with the triumph of good over evil, - not, however, with the annihilation of evil, but with its subjugation. This is the issue, inasmuch as absolute omnipotence is effectual on behalf of and through the exalted Christ. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>, springing from the utterance of Jahve, follow words expressing a prophetic prospect. Zion is the imperial abode of the great future King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>). &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1498; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11-14</a>) signifies "the sceptre (as insignia and the medium of exercise) of the authority delegated to thee" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-3.htm">Micah 5:3</a>). Jahve will stretch this sceptre far forth from Zion: no goal is mentioned up to which it shall extend, but passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a> show how the prophets understand such Psalms. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a> follow the words with which Jahve accompanies this extension of the dominion of the exalted One. Jahve will lay all his enemies at his feet, but not in such a manner that he himself remains idle in the matter. Thus, then, having come into the midst of the sphere (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) of his enemies, shall he reign, forcing them to submission and holding them down. We read this &#1512;&#1491;&#1492; in a Messianic connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>. So even in the prophecy of Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-19.htm">Numbers 24:19</a>), where the sceptre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>) is an emblem of the Messiah Himself. </body></html>
