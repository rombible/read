But the word for Lord here is <span class= "ital">Adonai, </span>which is nowhere else used except of God. Moreover, God throughout has as yet appeared as the active agent. It is He who stretched out the sceptre and conferred the office of priest; and hitherto the king has been the person addressed. It is therefore necessary still to consider him as addressed, and suppose that the change of position of Jehovah from the king’s right hand to his left is simply due to the usage of the language. To <span class= "ital">sit at the right hand </span>was an emblem of honour, <span class= "ital">to stand at the right hand </span>was a figure of protecting might (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-8.htm" title="I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.">Psalm 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-31.htm" title="For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.">Psalm 109:31</a>); and the imagery of a battle into which the song now plunges caused the change of expression.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/110.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm" title="The Lord at your right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.">Psalm 110:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord at thy right hand — </span>This, it seems, is to be understood of the Messiah, instated in his regal power at the right hand of his Father; and not of the Father himself, as his helper and defender, as the phrase is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-8.htm" title="I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.">Psalm 16:8</a>, and in some other places. Thus, this is an apostrophe to God the Father concerning his Son. This sense of the clause agrees best with the following verses; for it is evident that it is the same person who <span class="ital">strikes through kings, and judges among the heathen, and fills the places,</span> &c. <span class="ital">Shall strike through kings — </span>That is, shall break in pieces the greatest powers upon earth, who shall provoke his displeasure, by an obstinate opposition to his authority, and the establishment of his gospel. <span class="ital">In the day of his wrath — </span>In the day of battle, when he shall contend with them, and pour forth the floods of his wrath upon them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/110.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>110:1-7 Christ's kingdom. - Glorious things are here spoken of Christ. Not only he should be superior to all the kings of the earth, but he then existed in glory as the eternal Son of God. Sitting is a resting posture: after services and sufferings, to give law, to give judgment. It is a remaining posture: he sits like a king for ever. All his enemies are now in a chain, but not yet made his footstool. And his kingdom, being set up, shall be kept up in the world, in despite of all the powers of darkness. Christ's people are a willing people. The power of the Spirit, going with the power of the world, to the people of Christs, is effectual to make them willing. They shall attend him in the beautiful attire of holiness; which becomes his house for ever. And he shall have many devoted to him. The dew of our youth, even in the morning of our days, ought to be consecrated to our Lord Jesus. Christ shall not only be a King, but a Priest. He is God's Minister to us, and our Advocate with the Father, and so is the Mediator between God and man. He is a Priest of the order of Melchizedek, which was before that of Aaron, and on many accounts superior to it, and a more lively representation of Christ's priesthood. Christ's sitting at the right hand of God, speaks as much terror to his enemies as happiness to his people. The effect of this victory shall be the utter ruin of his enemies. We have here the Redeemer saving his friends, and comforting them. He shall be humbled; he shall drink of the brook in the way. The wrath of God, running in the curse of the law, may be considered as the brook in the way of his undertaking. Christ drank of the waters of affliction in his way to the throne of glory. But he shall be exalted. What then are we? Has the gospel of Christ been to us the power of God unto salvation? Has his kingdom been set up in our hearts? Are we his willing subjects? Once we knew not our need of his salvation, and we were not willing that he should reign over us. Are we willing to give up every sin, to turn from a wicked, insnaring world, and rely only on his merits and mercy, to have him for our Prophet, Priest, and King? and do we desire to be holy? To those who are thus changed, the Saviour's sacrifice, intercession, and blessing belong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/110.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord at thy right hand - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8</a>.<p>Shall strike through kings - The Hebrew word here rendered "shall strike," - from &#1502;&#1495;&#1509;  ma&#770;chats - means "to shake, to agitate"; and then, "to shake in pieces, to dash in pieces, to crush"; and here it has the sense of dashing in pieces, smiting, wounding, crushing. The "kings" referred to are the enemies of God and the Messiah, and the idea is that all would be subdued before him; that he would set up a universal dominion; that none would be able to stand before him; or, that he would reign over all the earth. The "language" is that which is derived from conquests in war; from the subjugation of enemies by force of arms. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9-12</a>; and the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>.<p>In the day of his wrath - <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/110.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. at thy right hand&#8212;as Ps 109:31, upholding and aiding, which is not inconsistent with Ps 110:1, where the figure denotes participation of power, for here He is presented in another aspect, as a warrior going against enemies, and sustained by God.<p>strike through&#8212;smite or crush.<p>kings&#8212;not common men, but their rulers, and so all under them (Ps 2:2, 10).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/110.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.<p>6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies: he shall wound the heads over many countries.<p>7 He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.<p>The last verses of this Psalm we understand to refer to the future victories of the Priest-King. He shall not for ever sit in waiting posture, but shall come Into the fight to end the weary war by his own victorious presence. He will lead the final charge in person; his own right hand and his holy arm shall get unto him the victory.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a><p>"The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath." Now that he has come into the field of action, the infinite Jehovah comes with him as the strength of his right hand. Eternal power attends the coming of the Lord, and earthly power dies before it as though smitten through with a sword. In the last days all the kingdoms of the earth shall be overcome by the kingdom of heaven, and those who dare oppose shall meet with swift and overwhelming ruin. What are kings when they dare oppose the Son of God? A single stroke shall suffice for their destruction. When the angel of the Lord smote Herod there was no need of a second blow; he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost. Concerning the last days, we read of the Faithful and True, who shall ride upon a white horse, and in righteousness judge and make war, "Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-6.htm">Psalm 110:6</a><p>"He shall judge among the heathen," or, among the nations. All nations shall feel his power, and either yield to it joyfully or be crushed before it. "He shall fill the places with the dead bodies." In the terrible battles of his gospel all opponents shall fall till the field of fight is heaped high with the slain. This need not be understood literally, but as a poetical description of the overthrow of all rebellious powers and the defeat of all unholy principles. Yet should kings oppose the Lord with weapons of war, the result would be their overwhelming defeat and the entire destruction of their forces. Read in connection with this prophecy the passage which begins at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17</a> and runs on to the end of the chapter. Terrible things in righteousness will be seen ere the history of this world comes to an end. "He shall wound the heads over many countries." He will strike at the greatest powers which resist him, and wound not merely common men, but those who rule and reign. If the nations will not have Christ for their Head, they shall find their political heads to be powerless to protect them. Or the passage may be read, "he has smitten the head over the wide earth." The monarch of the greatest nation shall not be able to escape the sword of the Lord; nor shall that dread spiritual prince who rules over the children of disobedience be able to escape without a deadly wound. Pope and priest must fall, with Mahomet and other deceivers who are now heads of the people. Jesus must reign and they must perish.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-7.htm">Psalm 110:7</a><p>"He shall drink of the brook in the way." So swiftly shall he march to conquest that he shall not stay for refreshment, but drink as he hastens on. Like Gideon's men that lapped, he shall throw his heart into the fray and cut it short in righteousness, because a short work will the Lord make in the earth. "Therefore shall he lift up the head." His own head shall be lifted high in victory, and his people, in him, shall be upraised also. When he passed this way before, he was burdened and had stern work laid upon him; but in his second advent he will win an easy victory; afore-time he was the man of sorrows, but when he comes a second time his head will be lifted in triumph. Let his saints rejoice with him. "Lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh." In the latter days we look for terrible conflicts and for a final victory. Long has Jesus borne with our rebellious race, but at length he will rise to end the warfare of long-suffering, by the blows of justice. God has fought with men's sins for their good, but he will not always by his Spirit strive with men; he will cease from that struggle of long-suffering love, and begin another which shall soon end in the final destruction of his adversaries. O King-priest, we who are, in a minor degree, king-priests too, are full of gladness because thou reignest even now, and wilt come ere long to vindicate thy cause and establish thine empire for ever. Even so, come quickly. Amen. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/110.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-27.htm">Psalm 109:27</a> the hand of God stands in contrast to accident, the work of men, and his own efforts. All and each one will undeniably perceive, when God at length interposes, that it is His hand which here does that which was impossible in the eyes of men, and that it is His work which has been accomplished in this affliction and in the issue of it. He blesses him whom men curse: they arise without attaining their object, whereas His servant can rejoice in the end of his affliction. The futures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-29.htm">Psalm 109:29</a> are not now again imprecations, but an expression of believingly confident hope. In correct texts &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; has Mem raphatum. The "many" are the "congregation" (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>). In the case of the marvellous deliverance of this sufferer the congregation or church has the pledge of its own deliverance, and a bright mirror of the loving-kindness of its God. The sum of the praise and thanksgiving follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-31.htm">Psalm 109:31</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; signifies quod, and is therefore allied to the &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; recitativum (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>). The three Good Friday Psalms all sum up the comfort that springs from David's affliction for all suffering ones in just such a pithy sentence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-34.htm">Psalm 69:34</a>). Jahve comes forward at the right hand of the poor, contending for him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>), to save (him) from those who judge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-33.htm">Psalm 37:33</a>), i.e., condemn, his soul. The contrast between this closing thought and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>. is unmistakeable. At the right hand of the tormentor stands Satan as an accuser, at the right hand of the tormented one stands God as his vindicator; he who delivered him over to human judges is condemned, and he who was delivered up is "taken away out of distress and from judgment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>) by the Judge of the judges, in order that, as we now hear in the following Psalm, he may sit at the right hand of the heavenly King. &#x395;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;...&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#837;!
