It is scarcely possible to conceive the horrors suffered by the hapless traveller, when crossing the trackless sands, exposed to the burning rays of the sum. The words describe their case whom the Lord has redeemed from the bondage of Satan; who pass through the world as a dangerous and dreary wilderness, often ready to faint through troubles, fears, and temptations. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, after God, and communion with him, shall be filled with the goodness of his house, both in grace and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he led them forth by the right way - A literal version, if the term necessary to express it might be allowable, would be," He wayed them in a straight way;" he made a way for them, and that was a straight way.

Thus God by his providence directs travellers that have lost their way, and puts them into the right way. There is no doubt a very great concern of Providence in such a case, and which ought to be acknowledged with thankfulness. And thus the Lord leads awakened and inquiring souls to the right way of salvation; to Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life; and directs and enables them to believe in him, to walk by faith, and to continue to walk in him, as they have received him; and which is a plain and straight way, in which they shall not stumble; yea, in which men, though fools, shall not err, wander, or lose themselves: and though this way is attended with many afflictions and tribulations, and so may be said to be a narrow and a rough way; yet it is a right one, and a safe one, it brings at last to eternal life: the Syriac version renders it, "by the way of truth". <p>That they might go to a city of habitation; a city to dwell in; the Targum is, <p>"to Jerusalem, a city to dwell in:'' <p>but any city nearest for travellers is here meant; and in a spiritual sense may be intended, either Christ, the city of refuge, where awakened sinners are directed to flee to, and where they find safety and plenty of provisions; or the church of God, the strong city, about which salvation is as walls and bulwarks; and to which they come when effectually called, and become citizens of it; or the New Jerusalem church state, in which the tabernacle of God will be, and he will dwell with men, and they with him; or the ultimate glory and happiness of the saints in heaven, that city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God; in which are everlasting habitations, and mansions of peace and rest for the people of God to dwell in, after they have gone through their troublesome passage in this wilderness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/107.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/107.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

The Psalm carries the marks of its deutero-Isaianic character on the very front of it, viz.: "the redeemed of Jahve," taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-12.htm">Isaiah 62:12</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-9.htm">Psalm 35:9</a>.; &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-8.htm">Isaiah 56:8</a>, and frequently; "from the north and from the sea," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-12.htm">Isaiah 49:12</a> : "the sea" (&#1497;&#1501;) here (as perhaps there also), side by side with east, west, and north, is the south, or rather (since &#1497;&#1501; is an established usus loquendi for the west) the south-west, viz., the southern portion of the Mediterranean washing the shores of Egypt. With this the poet associates the thought of the exiles of Egypt, as with &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; the exiles of the islands, i.e., of Asia Minor and Europe; he is therefore writing at a period in which the Jewish state newly founded by the release of the Babylonian exiles had induced the scattered fellow-countrymen in all countries to return home. Calling upon the redeemed ones to give thanks to God the Redeemer in order that the work of the restoration of Israel may be gloriously perfected amidst the thanksgiving of the redeemed ones, he forthwith formulates the thanksgiving by putting the language of thanksgiving of the ancient liturgy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>) into their mouth. The nation, now again established upon the soil of the fatherland, has, until it had acquired this again, seen destruction in every form in a strange land, and can tell of the most manifold divine deliverances. The call to sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving is expanded accordingly into several pictures portraying the dangers of the strange land, which are not so much allegorical, personifying the Exile, as rather exemplificative. </body></html>
