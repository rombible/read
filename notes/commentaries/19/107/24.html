Mariners have their business upon the tempestuous ocean, and there witness deliverances of which others cannot form an idea. How seasonable it is at such a time to pray! This may remind us of the terrors and distress of conscience many experience, and of those deep scenes of trouble which many pass through, in their Christian course. Yet, in answer to their cries, the Lord turns their storm into a calm, and causes their trials to end in gladness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These see the works of the Lord - They - sailors - have a special opportunity to see the works of God.

They see things which seem to come "directly" from God; which are "immediately" produced by him - not as the things which occur on the land, which are the result of "growth," and which are slowly developed. They seem in the solitariness and grandeur of the ocean to stand more directly in the presence of the great God.<p>And his wonders in the deep - In the abyss; in that which is distinguished for its "depth," as the mountains are for their height.

It is one who insanely lives only for the passing hour, and ruins health, calling, family, and in short himself and everything belonging to him. Those who were thus minded, the poet begins by saying, were obliged to suffer by reason of (in consequence of) their wicked course of life. The cause of their days of pain and sorrow is placed first by way of emphasis; and because it has a meaning that is related to the past &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; thereby comes all the more easily to express that which took place simultaneously in the past. The Hithpa. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a> signifies to suffer willingly or intentionally; here: to be obliged to submit to suffering against one's will. Hengstenberg, for example, construes it differently: "Fools because of their walk in transgression (more than 'because of their transgression'), and those who because of their iniquities were afflicted - all food," etc. But &#1502;&#1503; beside &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; has the assumption in its favour of being an affirmation of the cause of the affliction. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-18.htm">Psalm 107:18</a> the poet has the Book of Job (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-20.htm">Job 33:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-22.htm">Job 33:22</a>) before his eye. And in connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; (lxx), no passage of the Old Testament is more vividly recalled to one's mind than <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-19.htm">Psalm 105:19</a>, even more than <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>; because here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-19.htm">Psalm 105:19</a>, it treats of the intervention of divine acts within the sphere of human history, and not of the intervention of divine operations within the sphere of the natural world. In the natural world and in history the word (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;) is God's messenger (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-19.htm">Psalm 105:19</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>.), and appears here as a mediator of the divine healing. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm">Job 33:23</a>., the fundamental fact of the New Testament is announced, which Theodoret on this passage expresses in words: &#x39f;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x39b;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;. The lxx goes on to render it: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, inasmuch as the translators derive &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5</a>), and this, as &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; elsewhere (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>), from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, which is approved by Hitzig. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-20.htm">Lamentations 4:20</a> is against this. From &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; is formed a noun &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;) in the signification a hollow place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-10.htm">Proverbs 28:10</a>), the collateral form of which, &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;), is inflected like &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, plur. &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; with a retention of the substantival termination. The "pits" are the deep afflictions into which they were plunged, and out of which God caused them to escape. The suffix of &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1501; avails also for &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-5.htm">Genesis 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-5.htm">Isaiah 46:5</a>. </body></html>
