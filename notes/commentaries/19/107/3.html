It is scarcely possible to conceive the horrors suffered by the hapless traveller, when crossing the trackless sands, exposed to the burning rays of the sum. The words describe their case whom the Lord has redeemed from the bondage of Satan; who pass through the world as a dangerous and dreary wilderness, often ready to faint through troubles, fears, and temptations.

In the times of the captivity the people were not all taken to one place, or did not all abide in one place. In the long exile - of seventy years - in Babylon, they would naturally be much scattered in the different provinces; and the attempt to collect them together, to restore them again to their native land, might be attended with much difficulty.<p>From the east ... - From all quarters; from the places where they were scattered abroad. That is, one taking his position in Babylon would see them dispersed from that place as a center into all the surrounding country.<p>And from the south - Margin, as in Hebrew, "from the sea." In general, in the Old Testament, the word "sea" is used for the west, because the western boundary of the land of Palestine was the Mediterranean Sea. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-9.htm">Psalm 139:9</a>. But the supposed position of the speaker here is "Babylon," and on that account the south might be fitly designated by the word "sea;" as, on the south of Babylon, the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean would be soon reached. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. gathered&#8212;alluding to the dispersion of captives throughout the Babylonian empire.<p>from the south&#8212;literally, "the sea," or, Red Sea (Ps 114:3), which was on the south.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/107.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Bringing them into their own land, out of the several quarters of the world into which they had been carried. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the south, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">from the sea</span>; which in Scripture commonly notes the west, because the great midland sea was on the west of Canaan; but here, as it appears from the opposition of this to the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">north, </span> it notes the south, so called from the Red Sea, which was on the south, and which is sometimes called <span class="ital">the sea</span>, simply and without addition, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm" title="He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.">Psalm 72:8</a> 114:3</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/107.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And gathered them out of the lands,.... This cannot have respect to the bringing of the children of Israel out of Egypt; for they were not then brought out of several countries, but from one land only: nor to the Babylonish captivity; for, though some might be gathered out of different provinces, yet not from east, west, north, and south, as here expressed. It best suits with the gathering of the redeemed in the effectual calling, and particularly the calling of the Gentiles in Gospel times; to which the title of the Syriac version before mentioned has respect. The elect of God are gathered in consequence of being redeemed, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-8.htm">Zechariah 10:8</a>, they are gathered out of the world, and from among the men of it; they are gathered to Christ, and by him; they are gathered into his churches, and to communion with them, and to a participation of all privileges and ordinances: and this is usually done by the ministering of the Gospel, which is sent into all the world for this purpose; and a distinguishing blessing of grace it is to be gathered out from the rest of the world, and favoured with such rich mercies. Such have reason to adore the grace of God, and to show forth his praise, who has called them by his grace, and separated them from others for himself. <p>From the east and from the west, and from the north and from the south; or, "from the sea" (f); the southern sea, as the Targum; or the Red sea, the Arabian or Persian sea. The elect of God, and redeemed of the Lord, lie in all parts of the world; and from thence they are gathered by the ministry of the word unto Christ: this was fulfilled in the first times of the Gospel, and will be more so in the latter day; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5</a>. <p>(f) "et a mari", Pagninus, Montanus, Tigurine version, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/107.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/107.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">gathered them out of the lands</span>] In accordance with many a prophetic promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm" title="Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:">Jeremiah 32:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-34.htm" title="And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.">Ezekiel 20:34</a>; &c.); cp. the prayer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-47.htm" title="Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks to your holy name, and to triumph in your praise.">Psalm 106:47</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from the east</span> &c.] “From the four quarters of the earth,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm" title="And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/43-5.htm" title="Fear not: for I am with you: I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west;...">Isaiah 43:5-6</a>.

The Targ. explains it to mean ‘the southern sea,’ the Arabian gulf or the Indian ocean; possibly it may denote the southern part of the Mediterranean, washing the shore of Egypt: but on the whole it seems most probable that the Psalmist borrowed the phrase “from the north and from the sea” from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-12.htm" title="Behold, these shall come from far: and, see, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.">Isaiah 49:12</a>, and does not strictly enumerate the points of the compass. ‘The sea’ or ‘west’ there denotes the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>).

That verifies itself even now. That which Solomon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-50.htm">1 Kings 8:50</a> prays for on behalf of his people when they may be betrayed into the hands of the enemy, has been fulfilled in the case of the dispersion of Israel in all countries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-3.htm">Psalm 107:3</a>), Babylonia, Egypt, etc.: God has turned the hearts of their oppressors towards them.

From this source comes <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>, and also from this source <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-46.htm">Psalm 106:46</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-50.htm">1 Kings 8:50</a> together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>.
