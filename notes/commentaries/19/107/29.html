Mariners have their business upon the tempestuous ocean, and there witness deliverances of which others cannot form an idea. How seasonable it is at such a time to pray! This may remind us of the terrors and distress of conscience many experience, and of those deep scenes of trouble which many pass through, in their Christian course. Yet, in answer to their cries, the Lord turns their storm into a calm, and causes their trials to end in gladness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He maketh the storm a calm - God does this, and God only can do it. The fact, therefore, that Jesus did it <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>, proves that he was divine. There can be no more striking proof of divine power than the ability to calm the raging waves of the ocean by a word. This is literally, "He places the tempest to silence."<p>So that the waves thereof are still - Are lulled. The ocean ceases to be agitated, and the surface becomes smooth. Nothing is more still than the ocean in a calm. Not a breath of air seems to stir; not a ripple agitates the surface of the sea; the sails of the vessel hang loose, and even the vessel seems to be perfectly at rest: "As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean." So God can calm down the tempest of the soul. He can make the mind which was heaving and tossed, like the ocean, with anguish on account of guilt, and which trembled in view of the coming judgment, as calm as the ocean is when in its state of perfect repose. God can do "this," and none "but" God can do it; and as Jesus thus stills the agitation of the guilty soul, as he did the waves of the sea, "this" proves also that he is divine. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-32.

Without any allegory (Hengstenberg) it speaks of those who by reason of their calling traverse (which is expressed by &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; because the surface of the sea lies below the dry land which slopes off towards the coast) the sea in ships (read boo&#774;nijoth without the article), and that not as fishermen, but (as Luther has correctly understood the choice of the word) in commercial enterprises. These have seen the works and wonders of God in the eddying deep, i.e., they have seen with their own eyes what God can do when in His anger He calls up the powers of nature, and on the other hand when He compassionately orders them back into their bounds. God's mandate (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-31.htm">Psalm 105:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>) brought it to pass that a stormy wind arose (cf. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>), and it drove its (the sea's) waves on high, so that the seafarers at one time were tossed up to the sky and then hurled down again into deep abysses, and their soul melted &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, in an evil, anxious mood, i.e., lost all its firmness. They turned about in a circle (&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;( elc from &#1495;&#1490;&#1490;  equals  &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;) and reeled after the manner of a drunken man; all their wisdom swallowed itself up, i.e., consumed itself within itself, came of itself to nought, just as Ovid, Trist. i. 1, says in connection with a similar description of a storm at sea: ambiguis ars stupet ipsa malis. The poet here writes under the influence of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>. But at their importunate supplication God led them forth out of their distresses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-17.htm">Psalm 25:17</a>). He turned the raging storm into a gentle blowing ( equals  &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; &#1491;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>). &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; construed with &#1500; here has the sense of transporting (carrying over) into another condition or state, as Apollinaris renders: &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. The suffix of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; cannot refer to the &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, which is so far removed; "their waves" are those with which they had to battle. These to their joy became calm (&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;) and were still (&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1511; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-11.htm">Jonah 1:11</a>), and God guided them &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (lxx). &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1494;, a hapax-legomenon, from Arab. h&#803;a&#770;z (h&#803;wz), to shut in on all sides and to draw to one's self (root Arab. h&#803;w, gyravit, in gyrum egit), signifies a place enclosed round, therefore a haven, and first of all perhaps a creek, to use a northern word, a fiord. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1511; in relation to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is the stronger word, like &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; in relation to &#1495;&#1512;&#1501; in the history of the Flood. Those who have been thus marvellously rescued are then called upon thankfully to praise God their Deliverer in the place where the national church assembles, and where the chiefs of the nation sit in council; therefore, as it seems, in the Temple and in the Forum.<p>(Note: In exact editions like Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer's, before <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-24.htm">Psalm 107:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-28.htm">Psalm 107:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a> there stand reversed Nuns (&#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1508;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, in the language of the Masora &#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;), as before <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a> and between <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a> (nine in all). Their signification is unknown.)<p>Now follow two more groups without the two beautiful and impressive refrains with which the four preceding groups are interspersed. The structure is less artistic, and the transitions here and there abrupt and awkward. One might say that these two groups are inferior to the rest, much as the speeches of Elihu are inferior to the rest of the Book of Job. That they are, however, nevertheless from the hand of the very same poet is at once seen from the continued dependence upon the Book of Job and Isaiah. Hengstenberg sees in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33-42</a> "the song with which they exalt the Lord in the assembly of the people and upon the seat of the elders." but the materia laudis is altogether different from that which is to be expected according to the preceding calls to praise. Nor is it any the more clear to us that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33</a>. refer to the overthrow of Babylon, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-35.htm">Psalm 107:35</a>. to the happy turn of affairs that took place simultaneously for Israel; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-35.htm">Psalm 107:35</a> does not suit Canaan, and the expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-36.htm">Psalm 107:36</a>. would be understood in too low a sense. No, the poet goes on further to illustrate the helpful government of God the just and gracious One, inasmuch as he has experiences in his mind in connection therewith, of which the dispersion of Israel in all places can sing and speak. </body></html>
