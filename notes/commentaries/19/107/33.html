It is not only that the artistic form is dropped, and the series of vivid pictures, each closed by a refrain, succeeded by changed aspects of thought, but the language becomes harsher, and the poet, if the same, suddenly proclaims that he has exhausted his imagination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/107.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/107-33.htm" title="He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the springs into dry ground;...">Psalm 107:33-38</a>. </span><span class="ital">He turneth rivers — </span>Land watered with rivers; <span class="ital">into a wilderness — </span>Into dry ground, as it follows, like a parched and barren wilderness, that has not moisture enough to produce any thing valuable; <span class="ital">a fruitful land into barrenness — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">למלחה</span>, <span class="ital">limleechah, into saltness, </span>which causes barrenness; <span class="ital">for the wickedness of them that dwell therein — </span>He doth not inflict these judgments without cause, but for the punishment of sin in some, and the prevention of it in others. “Thus the plain of Jordan, which, before the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, was <span class="ital">well watered everywhere, </span>like the garden of Jehovah, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm" title="And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you come to Zoar.">Genesis 13:10</a>,) hath, since that overthrow, been a land of salt, and sulphur, and perpetual sterility. Nay, even the fruitful Palestine itself, that flowed with milk and honey, is at this day a region of utter desolation, so that the very possibility of its ever having sufficed to maintain the people who formerly possessed it is now called in question. And, indeed, while the rain of heaven shall continue to be in the hand of God, how easy is it for him, by withholding it during a few months, to blast all the most promising hopes of man; and, instead of plenty, joy, and health, to visit him with famine, pestilence, and death.” On the other hand, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-35.htm" title="He turns the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into springs.">Psalm 107:35</a>,) <span class="ital">he turneth the wilderness — </span>The barren and desolate wilderness; <span class="ital">into a standing water — </span>Into a well-watered and fruitful land. “When the ways of a people please God, the rain shall descend from above, the springs shall rise from beneath, the earth shall yield her increase, the cattle shall feed in large pastures, the seasons shall be kindly, the earth salutary, and the smiling face of nature shall attest the loving-kindness of the Lord. Thus, in the dispensations of grace, hath he dealt with Jews and Gentiles. The synagogue of the former, once rich in faith, watered with the benedictions of heaven, fruitful in prophets and saints, adorned with the services of religion, and the presence of Jehovah, hath been, since the murder of the Son of God, cursed with infidelity, parched like the withered tops of the mountains of Gilboah, barren and desolate as the land of their ancient residence, whose naked rocks seem to declare to all the world the hard-heartedness and unprofitableness of its old possessors. When <span class="ital">the fruitful field </span>thus became a <span class="ital">forest, </span>the <span class="ital">wilderness, </span>at the same time, became a <span class="ital">fruitful field. </span>A church was planted in the Gentile world, and <span class="ital">the Spirit was poured out upon it from on high. </span>In that <span class="ital">wilderness did waters break out, and streams in that desert. </span>There was faith sown, and holiness was the universal product. <span class="ital">The wilderness and the solitary place was glad, and the desert rejoiced and blossomed as the rose.

Let the present desolate state of Judea, and of other countries, explain this. If we look abroad in the world, we see many greatly increase, whose beginning was small. We see many who have thus suddenly risen, as suddenly brought to nothing. Worldly wealth is uncertain; often those who are filled with it, ere they are aware, lose it again. God has many ways of making men poor. The righteous shall rejoice. It shall fully convince all those who deny the Divine Providence. When sinners see how justly God takes away the gifts they have abused, they will not have a word to say. It is of great use to us to be fully assured of God's goodness, and duly affected with it. It is our wisdom to mind our duty, and to refer our comfort to him. A truly wise person will treasure in his heart this delightful psalm. From it, he will fully understand the weakness and wretchedness of man, and the power and loving-kindness of God, not for our merit, but for his mercy's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He turneth rivers into a wilderness - He makes great changes in the earth; he shows that he has absolute dominion over it.

The point here is, that God had such control over nature that he could make the bed of a river dry and barren as the rocky or sandy desert. He could effectually dry up the stream, and make it so dry and parched that nothing would grow but the most stunted shrubs, such as were found in the waste and sandy desert.<p>And the water-springs into dry ground - The very fountains of the rivers: not only drying up the river itself by leading it off into burning wastes where it would be evaporated by the heat, or lost in the sand - but so directly affecting the "sources" of the streams as to make them dry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33-41. He turneth rivers into a wilderness, &c.&#8212;God's providence is illustriously displayed in His influence on two great elements of human prosperity, the earth's productiveness and the powers of government. He punishes the wicked by destroying the sources of fertility, or, in mercy, gives fruitfulness to deserts, which become the homes of a busy and successful agricultural population. By a permitted misrule and tyranny, this scene of prosperity is changed to one of adversity. He rules rulers, setting up one and putting down another.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/107.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;<p>34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.<p>35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.<p>36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;<p>37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.<p>38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<p>39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.<p>40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.<p>41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.<p>42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice; and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33</a><p>"He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground." When the Lord deals with rebellious men he can soon deprive them of those blessings of which they feel most assured, their rivers and perennial springs they look upon as certain never to be taken from them, but the Lord at a word can deprive them even of these. In hot climates after long droughts streams of water utterly fail, and even springs cease to flow, and this also has happened in other parts of the world when great convulsions of the earth's surface have occurred. In providence this physical catastrophe finds its counterpart when business ceases to yield profit and sources of wealth are made to fail; as also when health and strength are taken away, when friendly aids are withdrawn, and comfortable associations are broken up. So, too, in soul matters, the most prosperous ministries may become dry, the most delightful meditations cease to benefit us, and the most fruitful religious exercises grow void of the refreshment of grace which they formerly yielded.

Without any allegory (Hengstenberg) it speaks of those who by reason of their calling traverse (which is expressed by &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; because the surface of the sea lies below the dry land which slopes off towards the coast) the sea in ships (read boo&#774;nijoth without the article), and that not as fishermen, but (as Luther has correctly understood the choice of the word) in commercial enterprises. These have seen the works and wonders of God in the eddying deep, i.e., they have seen with their own eyes what God can do when in His anger He calls up the powers of nature, and on the other hand when He compassionately orders them back into their bounds. God's mandate (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-31.htm">Psalm 105:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>) brought it to pass that a stormy wind arose (cf. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>), and it drove its (the sea's) waves on high, so that the seafarers at one time were tossed up to the sky and then hurled down again into deep abysses, and their soul melted &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, in an evil, anxious mood, i.e., lost all its firmness.

The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1511; in relation to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is the stronger word, like &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; in relation to &#1495;&#1512;&#1501; in the history of the Flood. Those who have been thus marvellously rescued are then called upon thankfully to praise God their Deliverer in the place where the national church assembles, and where the chiefs of the nation sit in council; therefore, as it seems, in the Temple and in the Forum.<p>(Note: In exact editions like Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer's, before <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-24.htm">Psalm 107:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-28.htm">Psalm 107:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a> there stand reversed Nuns (&#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1508;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, in the language of the Masora &#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;), as before <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a> and between <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a> (nine in all).

The structure is less artistic, and the transitions here and there abrupt and awkward. One might say that these two groups are inferior to the rest, much as the speeches of Elihu are inferior to the rest of the Book of Job. That they are, however, nevertheless from the hand of the very same poet is at once seen from the continued dependence upon the Book of Job and Isaiah. Hengstenberg sees in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33-42</a> "the song with which they exalt the Lord in the assembly of the people and upon the seat of the elders." but the materia laudis is altogether different from that which is to be expected according to the preceding calls to praise.

No, the poet goes on further to illustrate the helpful government of God the just and gracious One, inasmuch as he has experiences in his mind in connection therewith, of which the dispersion of Israel in all places can sing and speak. </body></html>
