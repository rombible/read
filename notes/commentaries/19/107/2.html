It is scarcely possible to conceive the horrors suffered by the hapless traveller, when crossing the trackless sands, exposed to the burning rays of the sum. The words describe their case whom the Lord has redeemed from the bondage of Satan; who pass through the world as a dangerous and dreary wilderness, often ready to faint through troubles, fears, and temptations. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, after God, and communion with him, shall be filled with the goodness of his house, both in grace and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the redeemed of the Lord say so - They are especially qualified to say so; they have special occasion to say so; they can and will appreciate this trait in his character. The word rendered "redeemed" here - from &#1490;&#1488;&#1500;  ga&#772;'al - means "delivered, rescued," without reference to any price paid for the deliverance. It refers here not to a ransom from "sin," but to deliverance from "danger." The probable allusion is to the deliverance from the captivity in Babylon. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>.<p>Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy - the power of the enemy. That is, He has saved them from their enemies, and has not suffered them to be destroyed by them. What is here said is true in the most eminent sense of those who are redeemed by the blood of the Son of God, and who are made heirs of salvation. Every consideration makes it proper that they should praise the Lord. Of all on earth, they have most occasion for such praise; of all among people, it may be presumed that they will be best qualified to appreciate the goodness of the Lord. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. redeemed of the Lord&#8212;(compare Isa 35:9, 10).<p>say&#8212;that is, that His mercy, &c.<p>hand of&#8212;or, "power of enemy."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/107.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The redeemed of the Lord; </span> all they whom God hath redeemed, as it is expressed in the next clause, or delivered from all the following calamities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Say so, </span> to wit, that <span class="ital">the Lord is good</span>, &c., as it is <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-1.htm" title="O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 107:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the enemy; </span> of such as had taken them captives, either in battle, or in their travels, to which they were led by their own inclinations, or by their necessary occasions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/107.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,.... That the Lord is good, and his mercy everlasting; since their redemption is a proof of his goodness, and an instance of his mercy; this is not to be understood of the Israelites redeemed from Egyptian bondage, or from the Babylonish captivity, though they had abundant reason to say as above; but rather of all such who are delivered from any sort of slavery, bondage, and confinement; whether from the power of a disease, or from a prison, or from wicked and unreasonable men; and from captivity in an enemy's country, where they have been used very severely; and as the providence of God is concerned in all such deliverances, thanks should be given him: it seems best to understand it of those who are spiritually redeemed by Christ, this phrase being frequently used of such, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>, who may be said to be so, since Christ is the author of their redemption; they are redeemed, not by themselves, nor by any creature, but by the Lord; who being their God, and near kinsman, had a right to redeem them, and, being God, was able to do it, and who has effected it by his precious blood; so that he has a right unto them and a property in them, which this phrase also suggests; and for all which they have great reason to praise the Lord and his goodness, and sing the new song of redeeming love. Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy from all their sins which war against their souls; from Satan their implacable adversary, who is stronger than they; from the law, which curses and threatens them with damnation and death; from death itself, the last enemy, and indeed from the hand of all their enemies, be they who they may. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/107.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> redeemed of the LORD say <i>so</i>, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</span><p>(b) As was true in the Jews, so there is not one of God's elect who does not feel his help in their necessity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/107.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the redeemed of the Lord say so</span>.

That verifies itself even now. That which Solomon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-50.htm">1 Kings 8:50</a> prays for on behalf of his people when they may be betrayed into the hands of the enemy, has been fulfilled in the case of the dispersion of Israel in all countries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-3.htm">Psalm 107:3</a>), Babylonia, Egypt, etc.: God has turned the hearts of their oppressors towards them. On &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;, to regard compassionately, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; belong together, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-6.htm">Psalm 107:6</a>, and frequently. &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is a cry of lamentation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28</a> in Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the Temple. From this source comes <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>, and also from this source <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-46.htm">Psalm 106:46</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-50.htm">1 Kings 8:50</a> together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>. In &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501; the drawing back of the tone does not take place, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-67.htm">Genesis 24:67</a>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; beside &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; is not pointed by the Ker&#1502; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a>, but as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-32.htm">Lamentations 3:32</a>, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>, &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493;: in accordance with the fulness (riches) of His manifold mercy or loving-kindness. The expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-46.htm">Psalm 106:46</a> is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-14.htm">Genesis 43:14</a>. Although the condition of the poet's fellow-countrymen in the dispersion may have been tolerable in itself, yet this involuntary scattering of the members of the nation is always a state of punishment. The poet prays in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a> that God may be pleased to put an end to this. </body></html>
