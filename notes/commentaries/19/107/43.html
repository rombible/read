(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-9.htm" title="Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.">Hosea 14:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/107.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-43.htm" title="Whoever is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the LORD.">Psalm 107:43</a></span>. <span class="ital">Whoso is wise, and will observe these things — </span>All who are truly wise will consider all these events, and will treasure up in their hearts the contents of this most instructive and delightful Psalm. <span class="ital">Even they — </span>Or, <span class="ital">and they, </span>namely, <span class="ital">each of them; </span>all such wise and considerate persons, <span class="ital">shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord — </span>Will see and acknowledge that God is kind and good to all, and that <span class="ital">his tender mercies are over all his works; </span>and that he is singularly kind and gracious to all wise and godly persons.

Let the present desolate state of Judea, and of other countries, explain this. If we look abroad in the world, we see many greatly increase, whose beginning was small. We see many who have thus suddenly risen, as suddenly brought to nothing. Worldly wealth is uncertain; often those who are filled with it, ere they are aware, lose it again. God has many ways of making men poor. The righteous shall rejoice. It shall fully convince all those who deny the Divine Providence. When sinners see how justly God takes away the gifts they have abused, they will not have a word to say. It is of great use to us to be fully assured of God's goodness, and duly affected with it. It is our wisdom to mind our duty, and to refer our comfort to him. A truly wise person will treasure in his heart this delightful psalm. From it, he will fully understand the weakness and wretchedness of man, and the power and loving-kindness of God, not for our merit, but for his mercy's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whoso is wise - All who are truly wise. That is, all who have a proper understanding of things, or who are disposed to look at them aright.<p>And will observe these things - Will attentively consider them; will reason upon them correctly; will draw just conclusions from them; will allow them to produce their "proper" impression on the mind. The meaning is, that these things would not be understood at a glance, or by a hasty and cursory observation, but that all who would take time to study them would see in them such proofs of wisdom and goodness that they could not fail to come to the conclusion that God is worthy of confidence and love.<p>Even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord - They will perceive that God is a merciful Being; that he seeks the welfare of the universe; that he desires the good of all; that the whole system is so arranged as to be adapted to secure the greatest good in the universe. No one can study the works of God, or mark the events of his providence, without perceiving that there are "innumerable" arrangements which have no other end than to produce happiness; which can be explained only on the supposition that God is a benevolent Being; which would not exist under the government of a malevolent being. And, although there are things which seem to be arrangements to cause suffering, and although sin and misery have been allowed to come into the world, yet we are not in circumstances to enable us to show that, in some way, these may not be consistent with a desire to promote the happiness of the universe, or that there may not be some explanation, at prosent too high for us, which will show that the principle of benevolence is applicable to all the works of God. Meantime, where we can - as we can in numberless cases - see the proofs of benevolence, let us praise God; where we cannot, let us silently trust him, and believe that there will yet be some way in which we may see this as the angels now see it, and, like them, praise him for what now seems to us to be dark and incomprehensible. There is an "eternity" before us in which to study the works of God, and it would not be strange if in that eternity we may learn things about God which we cannot understand now, or if in that eternity things now to us as dark as midnight may be made clear as noonday. How many things incomprehensible to us in childhood, become clear in riper years! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42, 43. In this providential government, good men will rejoice, and the cavils of the wicked will be stopped (Job 5:16; Isa 52:15), and all who take right views will appreciate God's unfailing mercy and unbounded love.   <a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/107.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.<p>Those who notice providences shall never be long without a providence to notice. It is wise to observe what the Lord doth, for he is wonderful in counsel; has given us eyes to see with, and it is foolish to close them when there is most to observe; but we must observe wisely, otherwise we may soon confuse ourselves and others with hasty reflections upon the dealings of the Lord. In a thousand ways the lovingkindness of the Lord is shown, and if we will but prudently watch, we shall come to a better understanding of it. To understand the delightful attribute of lovingkindness is an attainment as pleasant as it is profitable; those who are proficient scholars in this art will be among the sweetest singers to the glory of Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/107.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whoso is wise, and will observe these things; </span> or, <span class="ital">who</span> (for the Hebrew particle <span class="ital">mi</span> is interrogative) <span class="ital">is wise</span>? <span class="ital">for</span> (as the conjunctive particle is frequently used) <span class="ital">he will observe these things</span>.

Or as it may be read interrogatively, "who is wise?" as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>, that is, spiritually wise, wise unto salvation; who is made to know wisdom in the hidden part; for not such as are possessed of natural wisdom, or worldly wise men, much less who are wise to do evil, are here meant. <p>And will observe these things; the remarkable appearances of divine Providence to persons in distress; the various changes and vicissitudes in the world; the several afflictions of God's people, and their deliverances out of them; the wonderful works of God in nature, providence, and grace; these will be observed, taken notice of, laid up in the mind, and kept by such who are truly wise, who know how to make a right use and proper improvement of them. <p>Even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord; everyone of the wise men; they will perceive the kindness of God unto all men, in the several dispensations of his providence towards them, and his special love and kindness towards his own people, even in all their afflictions; they will perceive this to be at the bottom of every mercy and blessing; they will understand more of the nature and excellency of it, and know more of the love of God and Christ, which passeth knowledge.

It now goes on to tell what those who have now returned have observed and experienced in their own case. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33</a> sounds like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33</a> like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-35.htm">Psalm 107:35</a> takes its rise from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>.

A land that has been laid waste for the punishment of its inhabitants has very often been changed into flourishing fruitful fields under the hands of a poor and grateful generation; and very often a land that has hitherto lain uncultivated and to all appearance absolutely unprofitable has developed an unexpected fertility. The exiles to whom Jeremiah writes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-5.htm">Psalm 29:5</a> : Build ye houses and settle down, and plant gardens and eat their fruit, may frequently have experienced this divine blessing. Their industry and their knowledge also did their part, but looked at in a right light, it was not their own work but God's work that their settlement prospered, and that they continually spread themselves wider and possessed a not small, i.e., (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-3.htm">2 Kings 4:3</a>) a very large, stock of cattle. </body></html>
