Sinners are fools. They hurt their bodily health by intemperance, and endanger their lives by indulging their appetites. This their way is their folly. The weakness of the body is the effect of sickness. It is by the power and mercy of God that we are recovered from sickness, and it is our duty to be thankful. All Christ's miraculous cures were emblems of his healing diseases of the soul. It is also to be applied to the spiritual cures which the Spirit of grace works. He sends his word, and heals souls; convinces, converts them, makes them holy, and all by the word. Even in common cases of recovery from sickness, God in his providence speaks, and it is done; by his word and Spirit the soul is restored to health and holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat - All food; all that is to be eaten. The word rendered "abhorreth" is a word which is used with reference to anything that is abominable or loathsome; that from which we turn away with disgust. The language is expressive of sickness, when we loathe all food.<p>And they draw near unto the gates of death - They are sick, and are ready to die. The reference is to the under world - the world where the dead are supposed to dwell. This is represented here as a city which is entered through gates.

Thus to those who are distempered with sin, whose taste is not changed, nor can it discern perverse things, the word of God, the Gospel of Christ, which is delicious food, is not relished by them; the doctrines of it are insipid things, they loath them as light bread, as the Israelites did the manna. <p>And they draw near unto the gates of death; that is, the grave; the house appointed for all living; the dwelling place of men till the resurrection; and so is said to have gates and doors; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-22.htm">Job 33:22</a> and men sometimes are brought so low by affliction as that they seem to be near to death, just upon the brink of eternity, ready to enter into the grave, and lie down among the dead. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/107.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/107.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>.

Just as in the first strophe, here, too, as far as &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-15.htm">Psalm 107:15</a>, is all a compound subject; and in view of this the poet begins with participles. "Darkness and the shadow of death" (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>) is an Isaianic expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> (where &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; is construed with &#1489;), <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a> (where &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; is construed as here, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-20.htm">Genesis 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>), just as "bound in torture and iron" takes its rise from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>. The old expositors call it a hendiadys for "torturing iron" (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-18.htm">Psalm 105:18</a>); but it is more correct to take the one as the general term and the other as the particular: bound in all sorts of affliction from which they could not break away, and more particularly in iron bonds (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, like the Arabic firzil, an iron fetter, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-18.htm">Psalm 105:18</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-11.htm">Psalm 107:11</a>, which calls to mind <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>, and with respect to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-12.htm">Psalm 107:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>, the double play upon the sound of the words is unmistakeable. By &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; is meant the plan in accordance with which God governs, more particularly His final purpose, which lies at the basis of His leadings of Israel. Not only had they nullified this purpose of mercy by defiant resistance (&#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;) against God's commandments (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;, Arabic awa&#770;mir, a&#770;mireh) on their part, but they had even blasphemed it; &#1504;&#1488;&#1509;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-19.htm">Deuteronomy 32:19</a>, and frequently, or &#1504;&#1488;&#1509; (prop. to pierce, then to treat roughly), is an old Mosaic designation of blasphemy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-20.htm">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-23.htm">Numbers 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a>. Therefore God thoroughly humbled them by afflictive labour, and caused them to stumble (&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;). But when they were driven to it, and prayed importunately to Him, He helped them out of their straits. The refrain varies according to recognised custom. Twice the expression is &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1493;, twice &#1493;&#1497;&#1494;&#1506;&#1511;&#1493;; once &#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, then twice &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1501;, and last of all &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1501;, which follows here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-14.htm">Psalm 107:14</a> as an alliteration. The summary condensation of the deliverance experienced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-16.htm">Psalm 107:16</a>) is moulded after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a>. The Exile, too, may be regarded as such like a large jail (vid., e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-22.htm">Isaiah 42:22</a>); but the descriptions of the poet are not pictures, but examples. </body></html>
