In the eastern prisons the captives were and are treated with much severity. Afflicting providences must be improved as humbling providences; and we lose the benefit, if our hearts are unhumbled and unbroken under them. This is a shadow of the sinner's deliverance from a far worse confinement. The awakened sinner discovers his guilt and misery. Having struggled in vain for deliverance, he finds there is no help for him but in the mercy and grace of God. His sin is forgiven by a merciful God, and his pardon is accompanied by deliverance from the power of sin and Satan, and by the sanctifying and comforting influences of God the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because they rebelled against the words of God - The commands of God.

The law of God, at the same time that it "is" law, is of the nature of "counsel," since it is indicative of what God regards as wise and good, and since it is the best "advice" that God can give to people. A just and righteous law, while it involves "obligation" to obey it, is also the best counsel that can be given, and implies that the highest "wisdom" would be shown in being obedient to it. God will "command" nothing which he would not "advise," and which it would not be "wisdom" to obey.<p>Of the Most High - Of God, who, being supreme, has a right to rule over all, and to require that his laws shall be obeyed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-16.

All afflictions, as captivity and imprisonment, are generally for sin; which is a rebellion against God, and a transgression of his laws. Adam rebelled against the words of God, not giving credit to them, but believing the words of the devil; and so brought himself and all his posterity into that state of darkness, captivity, and death, before described. Some understand this only of the light of nature, and the dictates of it, against which men rebel; but rather it designs any and every revelation of the will of God, either in the law or in the Gospel; disobedience to which is rebellion against the words of God, and is highly resented by him. <p>And contemned the counsel of the most High; the advice he gives in his law, and by his prophets, what to do, and what to avoid: and which he gives by the ministers of the word, in his Gospel and in his ordinances; which are both called his counsel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>, the contempt of which is very displeasing to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-25.htm">Proverbs 1:25</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/107.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because they <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</span><p>(d) Then the true way to obey God is to follow his express commandment: also by this all are exhorted to descend into themselves as none are punished but for their sins.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/107.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.

According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>, it appears that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4</a> ought to be read &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; (Olshausen, Baur, and Thenius); but the line is thereby lengthened inelegantly. The two words, joined by Munach, stand in the construct state, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a> : a waste of a way  equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a> (Ewald, Hitzig), which is better suited to the poetical style than that &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, as in &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;p, and the like, should be an accusative of nearer definition (Hengstenberg). In connection with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; the poet, who is fond of this combination (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-7.htm">Psalm 107:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-36.htm">Psalm 107:36</a>, cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29</a>), means any city whatever which might afford the homeless ones a habitable, hospitable reception. With the perfects, which describe what has been experienced, alternates in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-5.htm">Psalm 107:5</a> the imperfect, which shifts to the way in which anything comes about: their soul in them enveloped itself (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-3.htm">Psalm 61:3</a>), i.e., was nigh upon extinction. With the fut. consec. then follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-6.htm">Psalm 107:6</a> the fact which gave the turn to the change in their misfortune. Their cry for help, as the imperfect &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; implies, was accompanied by their deliverance, the fact of which is expressed by the following fut. consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;. Those who have experienced such things are to confess to the Lord, with thanksgiving, His loving-kindness and His wonderful works to the children of men. It is not to be rendered: His wonders (supply &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;) towards the children of men (Luther, Olshausen, and others). The two &#1500; coincide: their thankful confession of the divine loving-kindness and wondrous acts is not to be addressed alone to Jahve Himself, but also to men, in order that out of what they have experienced a wholesome fruit may spring forth for the multitude. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1511;&#1511;&#1492; (part. Polel, the e&#772; of which is retained as a pre-tonic vowel in pause, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a> and on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-27.htm">Job 20:27</a>, Ew. 188, b) is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>, the thirsting soul (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, Arab. sa&#770;q, to urge forward, of the impulse and drawing of the emotions, in Hebrew to desire ardently). The preterites are here an expression of that which has been experienced, and therefore of that which has become a fact of experience. In superabundant measure does God uphold the languishing soul that is in imminent danger of languishing away. </body></html>
