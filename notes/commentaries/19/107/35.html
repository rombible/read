But the images are employed in a different manner. The prophet only thinks of the joy of returning Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/107-39.htm" title="Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.">Psalm 107:39-41</a>). But here the thought is that in the reverses of fortune, which even the chosen nation must be prepared for, God will intervene to protect and save. But the construction is very awkward, owing to the mode in which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-40.htm" title="He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.">Psalm 107:40</a>, two clauses from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-21.htm" title="He pours contempt on princes, and weakens the strength of the mighty.">Job 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-24.htm" title="He takes away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.">Job 12:24</a> are introduced.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/107.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>107:33-43 What surprising changes are often made in the affairs of men! Let the present desolate state of Judea, and of other countries, explain this. If we look abroad in the world, we see many greatly increase, whose beginning was small. We see many who have thus suddenly risen, as suddenly brought to nothing. Worldly wealth is uncertain; often those who are filled with it, ere they are aware, lose it again. God has many ways of making men poor. The righteous shall rejoice. It shall fully convince all those who deny the Divine Providence. When sinners see how justly God takes away the gifts they have abused, they will not have a word to say. It is of great use to us to be fully assured of God's goodness, and duly affected with it. It is our wisdom to mind our duty, and to refer our comfort to him. A truly wise person will treasure in his heart this delightful psalm. From it, he will fully understand the weakness and wretchedness of man, and the power and loving-kindness of God, not for our merit, but for his mercy's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He turneth the wilderness into a standing water - A pool; a lake.

He turneth rivers into a wilderness, &c.&#8212;God's providence is illustriously displayed in His influence on two great elements of human prosperity, the earth's productiveness and the powers of government. He punishes the wicked by destroying the sources of fertility, or, in mercy, gives fruitfulness to deserts, which become the homes of a busy and successful agricultural population. By a permitted misrule and tyranny, this scene of prosperity is changed to one of adversity.

Without any allegory (Hengstenberg) it speaks of those who by reason of their calling traverse (which is expressed by &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; because the surface of the sea lies below the dry land which slopes off towards the coast) the sea in ships (read boo&#774;nijoth without the article), and that not as fishermen, but (as Luther has correctly understood the choice of the word) in commercial enterprises. These have seen the works and wonders of God in the eddying deep, i.e., they have seen with their own eyes what God can do when in His anger He calls up the powers of nature, and on the other hand when He compassionately orders them back into their bounds. God's mandate (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-31.htm">Psalm 105:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>) brought it to pass that a stormy wind arose (cf. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>), and it drove its (the sea's) waves on high, so that the seafarers at one time were tossed up to the sky and then hurled down again into deep abysses, and their soul melted &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, in an evil, anxious mood, i.e., lost all its firmness. They turned about in a circle (&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;( elc from &#1495;&#1490;&#1490;  equals  &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;) and reeled after the manner of a drunken man; all their wisdom swallowed itself up, i.e., consumed itself within itself, came of itself to nought, just as Ovid, Trist. i. 1, says in connection with a similar description of a storm at sea: ambiguis ars stupet ipsa malis. The poet here writes under the influence of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>. But at their importunate supplication God led them forth out of their distresses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-17.htm">Psalm 25:17</a>). He turned the raging storm into a gentle blowing ( equals  &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; &#1491;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>). &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; construed with &#1500; here has the sense of transporting (carrying over) into another condition or state, as Apollinaris renders: &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. The suffix of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; cannot refer to the &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, which is so far removed; "their waves" are those with which they had to battle. These to their joy became calm (&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;) and were still (&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1511; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-11.htm">Jonah 1:11</a>), and God guided them &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (lxx). &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1494;, a hapax-legomenon, from Arab. h&#803;a&#770;z (h&#803;wz), to shut in on all sides and to draw to one's self (root Arab. h&#803;w, gyravit, in gyrum egit), signifies a place enclosed round, therefore a haven, and first of all perhaps a creek, to use a northern word, a fiord. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1511; in relation to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is the stronger word, like &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; in relation to &#1495;&#1512;&#1501; in the history of the Flood. Those who have been thus marvellously rescued are then called upon thankfully to praise God their Deliverer in the place where the national church assembles, and where the chiefs of the nation sit in council; therefore, as it seems, in the Temple and in the Forum.<p>(Note: In exact editions like Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer's, before <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-24.htm">Psalm 107:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-28.htm">Psalm 107:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a> there stand reversed Nuns (&#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1508;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, in the language of the Masora &#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;), as before <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a> and between <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a> (nine in all). Their signification is unknown.)<p>Now follow two more groups without the two beautiful and impressive refrains with which the four preceding groups are interspersed. The structure is less artistic, and the transitions here and there abrupt and awkward. One might say that these two groups are inferior to the rest, much as the speeches of Elihu are inferior to the rest of the Book of Job. That they are, however, nevertheless from the hand of the very same poet is at once seen from the continued dependence upon the Book of Job and Isaiah. Hengstenberg sees in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33-42</a> "the song with which they exalt the Lord in the assembly of the people and upon the seat of the elders." but the materia laudis is altogether different from that which is to be expected according to the preceding calls to praise. Nor is it any the more clear to us that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33</a>. refer to the overthrow of Babylon, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-35.htm">Psalm 107:35</a>. to the happy turn of affairs that took place simultaneously for Israel; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-35.htm">Psalm 107:35</a> does not suit Canaan, and the expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-36.htm">Psalm 107:36</a>. would be understood in too low a sense. No, the poet goes on further to illustrate the helpful government of God the just and gracious One, inasmuch as he has experiences in his mind in connection therewith, of which the dispersion of Israel in all places can sing and speak. </body></html>
