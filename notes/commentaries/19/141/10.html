It shall not break my head, if it may but help to break my heart: we must show that we take it kindly. Those who slighted the word of God before, will be glad of it when in affliction, for that opens the ear to instruction. When the world is bitter, the word is sweet. Let us lift our prayer unto God. Let us entreat him to rescue us from the snares of Satan, and of all the workers of iniquity. In language like this psalm, O Lord, would we entreat that our poor prayers should set forth our only hope, our only dependence on thee. Grant us thy grace, that we may be prepared for this employment, being clothed with thy righteousness, and having all the gifts of thy Spirit planted in our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/141.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the wicked fall into their own nets - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>.

Münster’s version in revising his translation of 1535 for the ‘Great Bible’ of 1539 (see <span class="ital">Introd</span>. p. lxxiii), and also of the variations between the editions of the Great Bible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Coverdale’s version of 1535 is: “Let the rightuous (rather) smite me frendly, and reprove me: so wil I take it, as though he had poured oyle upô my heade: it shal not hurte my heade, yee I wil praye yet for their wickednesse. Their iudges stôble at the stone, yet heare they my wordes, ye they be ioyfull. Oure bones lye scatered before ye pytt, like as when one graueth and dyggeth vp the grounde.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the Great Bible of 1539, reprinted in April 1540, the only change (with the exception of variations of spelling) is in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-6.htm" title="When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.">Psalm 141:6</a></span>, which runs: “Let theyr judges stomble in stony places: that they may heare my wordes, for they are swete.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But in the second Great Bible, also published in 1540, all the changes with which we are familiar in the P.B.V. have been introduced. The passage runs thus: “Let the ryghteous rather smyte me frendly and reproue me. But let not ther preciouse balmes: breake myne heed, yee, I wyll praye yet agaynste theyr wyckednesse. Lett theyr judges be overthrowen in stony places: that they may heare my wordes: for they are swete. Our bones lye scatered before the pit, lyke as whç one breaketh and heweth wood upô ye erth.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The substantial changes are all taken from Münster’s version: “Percutiat me justus in pietate atque redarguat me, oleum autem praecipuum non frangat caput meum: quia adhuc oratio mea contra mala eorum. Praecipitentur in locis petrosis judices illorum, ut audiant sermones meos, quoniam suaves sunt.

Arab. ta&#8219;allala b-'l-s&#780;', to meddle with any matter, to amuse, entertain one's self with a thing). The expression is made to express disgust as strongly as possible; this poet is fond of glaring colouring in his language.

It is a well-known thing that usurpers revel in the cuisine and cellars of those whom they have driven away. </body></html>
