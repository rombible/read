Evidently the danger to be guarded against was not so much a sinful act as a sinful utterance, and the expression “to make pretexts or excuses” may possibly refer to the casuistries by which some of the laxer Jews excused their participation in heathen rites or licentious banquets. Symmachus has, “to devise wicked devices.”<p><span class= "bld">Dainties.—</span>The word is peculiar to this passage, but derived from a root meaning “pleasant.” The LXX. and <span class= "ital">Vulg. </span>refer it to persons instead of things. But the use of the same root in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-6.htm" title="When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.">Psalm 141:6</a>, “for they are <span class= "ital">sweet,” </span>where the reference is to “words,” suggests a meaning here different both from the English and the ancient versions. “I will not taste of their sweets” may mean “I will not listen to their allurements: what finds favour with them shall not tempt me.” On the other hand, if we retain the English allusion to the dainties of a feast (so Symmachus), the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-6.htm" title="When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.">Psalm 141:6</a> will be used metaphorically in contrast. The words of condemnation he utters, though bitter to these feasters, are in reality sweet with the sweetness of truth.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/141.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>141:1-4 Make haste unto me. Those that know how to value God's gracious presence, will be the more fervent in their prayers. When presented through the sacrifice and intercession of the Saviour, they will be as acceptable to God as the daily sacrifices and burnings of incense were of old. Prayer is a spiritual sacrifice, it is the offering up the soul and its best affections. Good men know the evil of tongue sins. When enemies are provoking, we are in danger of speaking unadvisedly. While we live in an evil world, and have such evil hearts, we have need to pray that we may neither be drawn nor driven to do any thing sinful. Sinners pretend to find dainties in sin; but those that consider how soon sin will turn into bitterness, will dread such dainties, and pray to God to take them out of their sight, and by his grace to turn their hearts against them. Good men pray against the sweets of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/141.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Incline not my heart to any evil thing - Hebrew, to a word that is evil; that is, wrong. The connection seems to demand that the term should be thus explained. The expression "Incline not" is not designed to mean that God exerts any "positive" influence in leading the heart to that which is wrong; but it may mean "Do not place me in circumstances where I may be tempted; do not leave me to myself; do not allow any improper influence to come over me by which I shall be led astray." The expression is similar to that in the Lord's Prayer: "Lead us not into temptation." The psalmist's allusion here has been explained in the introduction to the psalm.<p>To practice wicked works with people that work iniquity - To be united or associated with people who do wrong; to do the things which wicked and unprincipled people do. Let me not be permitted to do anything that will be regarded as identifying me with them. Let me not, in the circumstances in which I am placed, be left to act so that the fair interpretation of my conduct shall be that I am one of their number, or act on the same principles on which they act. Literally, "To practice practices in wickedness with people."<p>And let me not eat of their dainties - Let me not be tempted by any prospect of participating in their mode of living - in the luxuries and comforts which they enjoy - to do a wicked or wrong thing. Let not a prospect or desire of this overcome my better judgment, or the dictates of my conscience, or my settled principles of what is right. People often do this. Good people are often tempted to do it. The prospect or the hope of being enabled to enjoy what the rich enjoy, to live in luxury and ease, to be "clothed in short linen and fare sumptuously every day," to move in circles of splendor and fashion, often leads them to a course of action which their consciences condemn; to practices inconsistent with a life of godliness; to sinful indulgences which utterly ruin their character. Satan has few temptations for man more attractive and powerful than the "dainties" which wealth can give; and there are few of his devices more effectual in ruining people than those which are derived from these allurements. The word here rendered dainties properly refers to things which are pleasant, lovely, attractive; which give delight or pleasure. It may embrace "all" that the world has to offer as suited to give pleasure or enjoyment. It refers here to what those in more elevated life have to offer; what they themselves live for. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/141.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 141<p>Ps 141:1-10.

Or "evil word" (z), as the Targum; since out of the abundance of that the mouth speaketh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>; or to any sinful thing, to the commission of any evil action: not that God ever inclines men's hearts to sin by any physical influence, it being what is repugnant to his nature and will, and what he hates and abhors; for though he hardens the hearts of wicked men, and gives them up to the lusts of them; yet he does not move, incline, or tempt any man to sin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>; but he may be said to do this when he suffers them to follow their own sinful inclinations, and leaves them to be inclined by the power and prevalency of their own corruptions, and by the temptations of Satan, which is here deprecated; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-36.htm">Psalm 119:36</a>. So as <p>to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity; to join with those that make a trade of sinning; the course of whose life is evil, in their unfruitful works of darkness; and do as they do, even commit crimes the most flagitious and enormous: he seems to have respect to great persons, whose examples are very forcible and ensnaring; and therefore it requires an exertion of the powerful and efficacious grace of God, to preserve such from the influence of them, whose business is much with them; <p>and let me not eat of their dainties; since their table was a snare to themselves, it might be so to him; and be a means of betraying him unawares into the commission of some sins, which would be dishonourable and grieving to him: the psalmist desires not to partake with them at their table; but chose rather a meatier table and coarser fare, where he might be more free from temptation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-1.htm">Proverbs 23:1</a>. Or this may be understood of the dainties and sweet morsels of sin; which are like stolen waters, and bread eaten in secret, to a carnal heart: though the pleasures of it are but imaginary, and last but for a season, and therefore are avoided by a gracious man; by whom even afflictions with the people of God are preferred unto them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-25.htm">Hebrews 11:25</a>.

The longer the poet lingers over the contemplation of the rebels the more lofty and dignified does his language become, the more particular the choice of the expressions, and the more difficult and unmanageable the construction. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1505;&#1489; signifies, causatively, to cause to go round about (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>), and to raise round about (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-6.htm">2 Chronicles 14:6</a>); here, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-11.htm">Joshua 6:11</a>, where with an accusative following it signifies to go round about: to make the circuit of anything, as enemies who surround a city on all sides and seek the most favourable point for assault; &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; from the participle &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;. Even when derived from the substantive &#1502;&#1505;&#1489; (Hupfeld), "my surroundings" is equivalent to &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-6.htm">Psalm 27:6</a>. Hitzig, on the other hand, renders it: the head of my slanderers, from &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, to go round about, Arabic to tell tales of any one, defame; but the Arabic sbb, fut. u, to abuse, the IV form (Hiphil) of which moreover is not used either in the ancient or in the modern language, has nothing to do with the Hebrew &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, but signifies originally to cut off round about, then to clip (injure) any one's honour and good name.<p>(Note: The lexicographer Neshwn says, i.:279b: Arab. 'l-sbb 'l  - s&#780;atm w-q&#305;&#770;l an as&#803;l 'l-sbb 'l - qat&#803;&#8219; t&#817;m s&#803;a&#770;r 'l  - s&#780;tm, "sebb is to abuse; still, the more original signification of cutting off is said to lie at the foundation of this signification." That Arab. qt&#803;&#8219; is synonymous with it, e.g., Arab. l&#305;&#770;s&#780;tqt&#8219;f&#305;&#770;na&#770;, why dost thou cut into us? i.e., why dost thou insult our honour? - Wetzstein.)<p>The fact that the enemies who surround the psalmist on every side are just such calumniators, is intimated here in the word &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a> &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468; (with an indefinite subject of the higher punitive powers, Ges. 137, note), in the signification to cause to descend, has a support in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-4.htm">Psalm 55:4</a>, whereas the Niph. &#1504;&#1502;&#1493;&#1496;, fut. &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;, which is preferred by the Ker, in the signification to be made to descend, is contrary to the usage of the language. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; has been combined by Parchon and others with the Arabic hmr, which, together with other significations (to strike, stamp, cast down, and the like), also has the signification to flow (whence e.g., in the Koran, ma&#770;' munhamir, flowing water). "Fire" and "water" are emblems of perils that cannot be escaped, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-12.htm">Psalm 66:12</a>, and the mention of fire is therefore appropriately succeeded by places of flowing water, pits of water. The signification "pits" is attested by the Targum, Symmachus, Jerome, and the quotation in Kimchi: "first of all they buried them in &#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;; when the flesh was consumed they collected the bones and buried them in coffins."

Like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10-11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-12.htm">Psalm 140:12</a> is also not to be taken as a general maxim, but as expressing a wish in accordance with the excited tone of this strophe. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; is not a great talker, i.e., boaster, but an idle talker, i.e., slanderer (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, cf. Sir. 8:4). According to the accents, &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; &#1512;&#1506; is the parallel; but what would be the object of this designation of violence as worse or more malignant? With Sommer, Olshausen, and others, we take &#1512;&#1506; as the subject to &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;: let evil, i.e., the punishment which arises out of evil, hunt him; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-21.htm">Proverbs 13:21</a>, &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, and the opposite in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>.
