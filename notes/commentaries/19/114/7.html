Well may we stand in awe of this God of almighty power, and well may we put our trust in this Being of boundless goodness, who, rather than his people should want what is necessary for their sustenance, will bring substantial bread out of the airy clouds, and refreshing waters out of the dry and flinty rocks! <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/114.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>114:1-8 An exhortation to fear God. - Let us acknowledge God's power and goodness in what he did for Israel, applying it to that much greater work of wonder, our redemption by Christ; and encourage ourselves and others to trust in God in the greatest straits. When Christ comes for the salvation of his people , he redeems them from the power of sin and Satan, separates them from an ungodly world, forms them to be his people, and becomes their King. There is no sea, no Jordan, so deep, so broad, but, when God's time is come, it shall be divided and driven back. Apply this to the planting the Christian church in the world. What ailed Satan and his idolatries, that they trembled as they did? But especially apply it to the work of grace in the heart. What turns the stream in a regenerate soul? What affects the lusts and corruptions, that they fly back; that prejudices are removed, and the whole man becomes new? It is at the presence of God's Spirit. At the presence of the Lord, not only mountains, but the earth itself may well tremble, since it has lain under a curse for man's sin. As the Israelites were protected, so they were provided for by miracles; such was that fountain of waters into which the flinty rock was turned, and that rock was Christ. The Son of God, the Rock of ages, gave himself to death, to open a fountain to wash away sins, and to supply believers with waters of life and consolation; and they need not fear that any blessing is too great to expect from his love. But let sinners fear before their just and holy Judge. Let us now prepare to meet our God, that we may have boldness before him at his coming.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/114.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord ... - This is at the same time an explanation of the facts referred to in the previous verses, and the statement of an important truth in regard to the power of God. The true explanation - as here implied - of what occurred to the sea, to the Jordan, to the mountains, and to the hills, was the fact that God was there; the inference from that, or the truth which followed from that, was, that before that God in whose presence the very mountains shook, and from whom the waters of the sea fled in alarm the whole earth should tremble. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/114.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. at the presence of&#8212;literally, "from before," as if affrighted by the wonderful display of God's power.

Or, "the earth has trembled at the presence of the Lord"; so the Syriac and Arabic versions render it; the imperative is sometimes put for the preterite or past tense, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-9.htm">Psalm 22:9</a>, likewise the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions thus render it, "the earth is moved at the presence of the Lord"; and then the sense is by a prosopopoeia. Is it to be wondered at, that we, the sea, the river of Jordan, the mountains and hills, have fled, or have been driven back, or have skipped like rams and lambs, when the whole earth, of which we are a part, has trembled at the presence of God? who, when he does but look, the earth trembles; and when he touches the hills, they smoke, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>. It is at the same presence of God we have been thus moved, the power of which we have felt, even <p>at the presence of the God of Jacob; who brought Jacob out of Egypt, led him through the sea, and gave him the law on Sinai. This is not to be understood of the general and common presence of God, which is everywhere, and with all his creatures for this is not attended with such wonderful phenomena as here mentioned, either in the literal or mystic sense; but of the majestic, powerful, and gracious presence of God; such as he sometimes causes to attend his ministers, his word, his churches, his martyrs and confessors; and so as to strike an awe upon, and terror into, their greatest enemies, as well as to convert his own people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/114.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Tremble, thou <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;</span><p>(d) Ought then his people to be insensible when they see his power and majesty?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/114.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

It was at Jehovah’s presence that earth trembled then; but instead of a formal answer the poet’s words take a wider range, and he bids earth tremble still at the presence of its Lord, Who proves His sovereignty by transforming its most stubborn elements for the benefit of His people.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/114.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord</span>. The answer is given, but only indirectly given, in these words. Nothing less than "the presence of the Lord" - a miraculous and abnormal presence  - can have produced the strange phenomena. The earth has felt the presence of God, and has trembled, and has done right to tremble; but Israel may take comfort from the theophany, for it is a manifestation on her behalf. The presence that has made itself felt is <span class="cmt_word">the presence of the God of Jacob</span> - the God who watches over Jacob, and will succor and protect him constantly. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/114.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Egypt is called &#1506;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1494; (from &#1500;&#1506;&#1494;, cogn. &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;, &#1500;&#1506;&#1492;), because the people spoke a language unintelligible to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-6.htm">Psalm 81:6</a>), and as it were a stammering language. The lxx, and just so the Targum, renders &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (from the Sanscrit barbaras, just as onomatopoetic as balbus, cf. Fleischer in Levy's Chaldisches Wrterbuch, i. 420). The redeemed nation is called Judah, inasmuch as God made it His sanctuary (&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;) by setting up His sanctuary (&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>) in the midst of it, for Jerusalem (el k&#803;uds) as Benjamitish Judaean, and from the time of David was accounted directly as Judaean. In so far, however, as He made this people His kingdom (&#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, an amplificative plural with Mem pathachatum), by placing Himself in the relation of King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>) to the people of possession which by a revealed law He established characteristically as His own, it is called Israel. 1 The predicate takes the form &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;, for peoples together with country and city are represented as feminine (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>). The foundation of that new beginning in connection with the history of redemption was laid amidst majestic wonders, inasmuch as nature was brought into service, co-operating and sympathizing in the work (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>.). The dividing of the sea opens, and the dividing of the Jordan closes, the journey through the desert to Canaan. The sea stood aside, Jordan halted and was dammed up on the north in order that the redeemed people might pass through. And in the middle, between these great wonders of the exodus from Egypt and the entrance into Canaan, arises the not less mighty wonder of the giving of the Law: the skipping of the mountains like rams, of the ills like &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, i.e., lambs (Wisd. 19:9), depicts the quaking of Sinai and its environs (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, cf. supra <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>, and on the figure <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-6.htm">Psalm 29:6</a>). </body></html>
