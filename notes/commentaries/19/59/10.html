It is very comfortable to us, in prayer, to look to God as the God of our mercy, the Author of all good in us, and the Giver of all good to us. The wicked can never be satisfied, which is the greatest misery in a poor condition. A contented man, if he has not what he would have, yet he does not quarrel with Providence, nor fret within himself. It is not poverty, but discontent that makes a man unhappy. David would praise God because he had many times, and all along, found Him his refuge in the day of trouble. He that is all this to us, is certainly worthy of our best affections, praises, and services. The trials of his people will end in joy and praise. When the night of affliction is over, they will sing of the Lord's power and mercy in the morning. Let believers now, in assured faith and hope, praise Him for those mercies, for which they will rejoice and praise him for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/59.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The God of my mercy shall prevent me - Or rather, "My God - his mercy shall prevent me." This is in accordance with the present reading of the Hebrew text, and is probably correct. The psalmist looks to God as his God, and then the feeling at once springs up that his mercy - favor - his loving-kindness - "would" "prevent" him. On the word "prevent" see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm">Psalm 21:3</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>. The meaning here is, that God would "go before him," or would "anticipate" his necessities.<p>God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies - That is, He will let me see them discomfited, and disappointed in their plans. This is equivalent to saying that God would give him the victory, or would not suffer them to triumph over him.

Or "of my grace", or "goodness", as the Targum; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>. God is gracious in himself, and he has treasured up a fulness of grace in Christ: he is the donor of all the blessings of grace in the covenant; and the author of all internal grace in the hearts of his people; and who supplies them with more grace as they want it; and he is the Father of all temporal and spiritual mercies. The "Cetib", or writing, is  "his mercy"; the "Keri", or reading, is  "my mercy"; grace or mercy is the Lord's; it is his own, which he disposes of as he pleases; being given and applied, it is the believer's; all the grace and mercy in the heart of God, in his Son, and in his covenant, is the saints', which he keeps for them with Christ for evermore; "the God of my mercy", or "grace", is the same with "my merciful", or "my gracious God"; who goes before his people, as he does the Messiah, with the blessings of his goodness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm">Psalm 21:3</a>. It may be rendered, "hath came before me"; and denote the antiquity of his love, being before his people's to him, and the early provisions of his grace and mercy for them: or "doth prevent me": expressing the freeness of it; he not waiting for any duties, services, or conditions to be performed, but bestows his grace and mercy, notwithstanding much unworthiness: or "shall come before me"; designing the seasonable and timely application of mercy come before his fears, as it sometimes does the prayers of his people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>; <p>God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies; expressed in the following verses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a>; or "vengeance upon them"; as the Targum paraphrases it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/59.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The God of my mercy shall <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> prevent me: God shall let me see <i>my desire</i> upon mine enemies.</span><p>(h) He will not fail to help me when need requires.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/59.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

The enemies are called &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-7.htm">Job 27:7</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; as shameless, &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>, on account of their bold shameless greediness, dogs. On &#1500;&#1488; in a subordinate clause, vid., Ewald, &#1431;286, g: without there being transgression or sin on my side, which might have caused it. The suffix (transgression on my part) is similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-24.htm">Psalm 18:24</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-6.htm">Job 34:6</a>) is a similar adverbial collateral definition: without there existing any sin, which ought to be punished. The energetic future jeruzu&#770;n depicts those who servilely give effect to the king's evil caprice; they run hither and thither as if attacking and put themselves in position. &#1492;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;  equals  &#1492;&#1514;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, like the Hithpa. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-26.htm">Proverbs 26:26</a>, the Hothpa. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1505;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-55.htm">Leviticus 13:55</a>., and the Hithpa. &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-8.htm">Deuteronomy 21:8</a>. Surrounded by such a band of assassins, David is like one besieged, who sighs for succour; and he calls upon Jahve, who seems to be sleeping and inclined to abandon him, with that bold &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, to awake to meet him, i.e., to join him with His help like a relieving army, and to convince Himself from personal observation of the extreme danger in which His charge finds himself. The continuation was obliged to be expressed by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, because a special appeal to God interposes between &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; and &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;. In the emphatic "Thou," however, after it has been once expressed, is implied the conditional character of the deliverance by the absolute One. And each of the divine names made use of in this lengthy invocation, which corresponds to the deep anxiety of the poet, is a challenge, so to speak, to the ability and willingness, the power and promise of God. The juxtaposition Jahve Elohim Tsebaoth (occurring, besides this instance, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-5.htm">Psalm 80:5</a>, 20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-9.htm">Psalm 84:9</a>), which is peculiar to the Elohimic Psalms, is to be explained by the consideration that Elohim had become a proper name like Jahve, and that the designation Jahve Tsebaoth, by the insertion of Elohim in accordance with the style of the Elohimic Psalms, is made still more imposing and solemn; and now &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is a genitive dependent not merely upon &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; but upon &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (similar to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>; Symbolae, p. 15). &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is in apposition to this threefold name of God. The poet evidently reckons himself as belonging to an Israel from which he excludes his enemies, viz., the true Israel which is in reality the people of God. Among the heathen, against whom the poet invokes God's interposition, are included the heathen-minded in Israel; this at least is the view which brings about this extension of the prayer. Also in connection with the words &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497; the poet, in fact, has chiefly before his mind those who are immediately round about him and thus disposed. It is those who act treacherously from extreme moral nothingness and worthlessness (&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; genit. epexeg.). The music, as Sela directs, here becomes more boisterous; it gives intensity to the strong cry for the judgment of God; and the first unfolding of thought of this Michtam is here brought to a close.<p>The second begins by again taking up the description of the movements of the enemy which was begun in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>. We see at a glance how here <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a> coincides with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-8.htm">Psalm 59:8</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-9.htm">Psalm 59:9</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6</a>. Hence the imprecatory rendering of the futures of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a> is not for a moment to be entertained. By day the emissaries of Saul do not venture to carry out their plot, and David naturally does not run into their hands. They therefore come back in the evening, and that evening after evening (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>); they snarl or howl like dogs (&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, used elsewhere of the growling of the bear and the cooing of the dove; it is distinct from &#1504;&#1489;&#1495;, Arab. nbb, nbh&#803;, to bark, and &#1499;&#1500;&#1489;, to yelp), because they do not want to betray themselves by loud barking, and still cannot altogether conceal their vexation and rage; and they go their rounds in the city (like &#1505;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, Sol 3:2, cf. supra <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-11.htm">Psalm 55:11</a>), in order to cut off their victim from flight, and perhaps, what would be very welcome to them, to run against him in the darkness. The further description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-8.htm">Psalm 59:8</a> follows them on this patrol. What they belch out or foam out is to be inferred from the fact that swords are in their lips, which they, as it were, draw so soon as they merely move their lips. Their mouth overflows with murderous thoughts and with slanders concerning David, by which they justify their murderous greed to themselves as if there were no one, viz., no God, who heard it. But Jahve, from whom nothing, as with men, can be kept secret, laughs at them, just as He makes a mockery of all heathen, to whom this murderous band, which fears the light and in unworthy of the Israelitish name, is compared. This is the primary passage to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-13.htm">Psalm 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>; for <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a> is perhaps the oldest of the Davidic Psalms that have come down to us, and therefore also the earliest monument of Israelitish poetry in which the divine name Jahve Tsebaoth occurs; and the chronicler, knowing that it was the time of Samuel and David that brought it into use, uses this name only in the life of David. Just as this strophe opened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a> with a distich that recurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-15.htm">Psalm 59:15</a>, so it also closes now in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> with a distich that recurs below in v. 18, and that is to be amended according to the text of that passage. For all attempts to understand &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; as being genuine prove its inaccuracy. With the old versions it has to be read &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;; but as for the rest, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; must be retained in accordance with the usual variation found in such refrains: my strength, Thee will I regard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-15.htm">1 Samuel 26:15</a>; observe, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-16.htm">2 Samuel 11:16</a>), or upon Thee will I wait (cf. &#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-6.htm">Psalm 130:6</a>); i.e., in the consciousness of my own feebleness, tranquil and resigned, I will look for Thine interposition on my behalf. </body></html>
