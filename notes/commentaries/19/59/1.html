And thus earnestly should we pray daily, to be defended and delivered from our spiritual enemies, the temptations of Satan, and the corruptions of our own hearts. We should fear suffering as evil-doers, but not be ashamed of the hatred of workers of iniquity. It is not strange, if those regard not what they themselves say, who have made themselves believe that God regards not what they say.

This prayer was offered when the spies sent by Saul surrounded the house of David. They had come to apprehend him, and it is to be presumed that they had come in sufficient numbers, and with sufficient power, to effect their object. Their purpose was not to break in upon him in the night, but to watch their opportunity, when he went forth in the morning, to slay him <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11</a>, and there seemed no way for him to escape. Of their coming, and of their design, Michal, the daughter of Saul, and the wife of David, seems to have been apprised - perhaps by someone of her father's family. She informed David of the arrangement, and assured him that unless he should escape in the night, he would be put to death in the morning. She, therefore, let him down through a window, and he escaped, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-12.htm">1 Samuel 19:12</a>. It was in this way that he was in fact delivered; in this way that his prayer was answered. A faithful wife saved him.<p>Defend me from them that rise up against me - Margin, as in Hebrew, "Set me on high." The idea is that of placing him, as it were, on a tower, or on an eminence which would be inaccessible. These were common places of refuge or defense.

They were all round the house with the warrant of authority, and a force equal to the carrying of it out. He was to be taken dead or alive, well or ill, and carried to the slaughter. No prowess could avail him to break the cordon of armed men, neither could any eloquence stay the hand of his bloody persecutor. He was taken like a bird in a net, and no friend was near to set him free. Unlike the famous starling, he did not cry, "I can't get out," but his faith uttered quite another note. Unbelief would have suggested that prayer was a waste of breath, but not so thought the good man, for he makes it his sole resort. He cries for deliverance and leaves ways and means with his God. "Defend me from them that rise up against me." Saul was a king, and therefore sat in high places, and used all his authority to crush David; the persecuted one therefore beseeches the Lord to set him on high also, only in another sense. He asks to be lifted up, as into a lofty tower, beyond the reach of his adversary. Note how he sets the title "My God," over against the word "mine enemies." This is the right method of effectually catching and quenching the fiery darts of the enemy upon the shield of faith. God is our God, and therefore deliverance and defence are ours.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-2.htm">Psalm 59:2</a><p>"Deliver me from the workers of iniquity." Saul was treating him very unjustly, and besides that was pursuing a tyrannical and unrighteous course towards others, therefore David the more vehemently appeals against him. Evil men were in the ascendant at court, and were the ready tools of the tyrant, against these also he prays. Bad men in a bad cause may be pleaded against without question. When a habitation is beset by thieves, the good man of the house rings the alarm-bell; and in these verses we may hear it ring out loudly, "deliver me," "defend me," "deliver me,... save me." Saul had more cause to fear than David had, for the invincible weapon of prayer was being used against him, and heaven was being aroused to give him battle. "And save me from bloody men." As David remembers how often Saul had sought to assassinate him, he knows what he has to expect from that quarter and from the king's creatures and minions who were watching for him. David represents his enemy in his true colours before God; the bloodthirstiness of the foe is a fit reason for the interposition of the righteous God, for the Lord abhors all those who delight in blood. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The matter and design of this Psalm is the same in general and for substance with the former, to wit, a declaration of the cruelty and treachery of his enemies; and a prayer to God to deliver him out of their hands. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>David, in danger, prayeth unto God for deliverance from his enemies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-1.htm" title="Deliver me from my enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.">Psalm 59:1</a>,2</span>, relating his own innocency and their cruelty, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-3.htm" title="For, see, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.">Psalm 59:3</a></span>.

Genesis Rabba, ch. 51 init., where &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500; is explained by &#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, &#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1497;, &#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1497;, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;, &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, limax. Abraham b. David of Fez, the contemporary of Saadia, has explained it in his Arabico-Hebrew Lexicon by &#1488;&#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, the slug. Nevertheless this is properly the name of the snail with a house (&#1504;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1511;), Talmudic &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, and even at the present day in Syria and Palestine Arab. h&#803;lzu&#770;n (which is pronounced h&#803;alezo&#770;n); whereas &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500;, in conformity with the etymon and with the figure, is the naked snail or slug. The ancient versions perhaps failed to recognise this, because the slug is not very often to be seen in hot eastern countries; but &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500; in this signification can be looked upon as traditional. The rendering "a rain-brook or mountain-torrent (Arabic seil sa&#770;bil) which running runs away," would, to say nothing more, give us, as Rosenmller has already observed, a figure that has been made use of already in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>.)<p>In the second figure, the only sense in which &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; belong together is "the untimely birth of a woman;" and rather than explain with the Talmud (B. Med katan 6b) and Targum (contrary to the accents): as an abortion, a mole, <p>(Note: The mole, which was thought to have no eyes, is actually called in post-biblical Hebrew &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, plur. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; (vid., Keelim xxi. 3).)<p>one would alter &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; into &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;. But this is not necessary, since the construct form &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; is found also in other instances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-11.htm">Deuteronomy 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>) out of the genitival relation, in connection with a close coordinate construction. So here, where &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3-5</a>, is an attributive clause to &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; (the falling away of a woman  equals  abortions), which is used collectively (Ew. 176, b). The accentuation also harmonizes here with the syntactic relation of the words. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>, &#1488;&#1496;&#1491; (plural in African, i.e., Punic, in Dioscorides atadi'n) is the rhamnus or buckthorn, which, like &#1512;&#1514;&#1501;, the broom, not only makes a cheerful crackling fire, but also produces an ash that retains the heat a long time, and is therefore very useful in cooking. The alternative &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; - &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; signifies sive, sive, whether the one or the other. &#1495;&#1497; is that which is living, fresh, viz., the fresh, raw meat still having the blood in it, the opposite of &#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-15.htm">1 Samuel 2:15</a>); &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, a fierce heat or fire, here a boiling heat. There is no need to understand &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; metonymically, or perhaps as an adjective  equals  charro&#770;n, of boiled meat: it is a statement of the condition. The suffix of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, however, refers, as being neuter, to the whole cooking apparatus, and more especially to the contents of the pots. The rendering therefore is: whether raw or in a state of heat, i.e., of being cooked through, He (Jahve) carries it away as with a whirlwind. Hengstenberg rightly remarks, "To the raw meat correspond the immature plots, and to the cooked the mature ones." To us, who regard the Psalm as belonging to the time of Absalom, and not, like Hengstenberg, to the time of Saul, the meat in the pots is the new kingship of Absalom. The greater the self-renunciation with which David at that time looked on at the ripening revolt, disclaiming all action of his own, the stronger the confidence with which he expected the righteous interposition of God that did actually follow, but (as he here supposes possible) not until the meat in the pot was almost done through; yet, on the other side, so quickly, that the pots had scarcely felt the crackling heat which should fully cook the meat. </body></html>
