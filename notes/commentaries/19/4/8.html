Any good will serve the turn of most men, but a gracious soul will not be put off so. Lord, let us have thy favour, and let us know that we have it, we desire no more; let us be satisfied of thy loving-kindness, and will be satisfied with it. Many inquire after happiness, but David had found it. When God puts grace in the heart, he puts gladness in the heart. Thus comforted, he pitied, but neither envied nor feared the most prosperous sinner. He commits all his affairs to God, and is prepared to welcome his holy will. But salvation is in Christ alone; where will those appear who despise him as their Mediator, and revile him in his disciples? May they stand in awe, and no longer sin against the only remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep - The word "both" here means "at the same time;" that is, I will alike be in peace, and I will lie down and will sleep; I will have a mind at peace (or, in tranquility) when I lie down, and will sleep calmly. This is said in view of his confidence in God, and of his belief that God would preserve him. He had put his trust in him; he had sought his happiness in him, and now he felt assured that he had nothing to fear, and, at peace with God, he would lie down and compose himself to rest. This is the counterpart of what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>. There he says in the morning, that, though surrounded by fear, he "had" been permitted to lie calmly down and sleep; here he says, that, though he is surrounded by fear, he has such confidence in God, that he "will" give himself to quiet slumber. His mind was free from anxiety as to the result of the present troubles; he had calm confidence in God; he committed all to him; and thus gave himself to rest. No one can fail to admire the beauty of this; and no one can fail to perceive that entire confidence in God, and an assurance that all things are under his control, are best adapted of all things to give peaceful days and nights.<p>For thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety - There are two ideas here:<p>(a) One a confidence that he would abide in safety;<p>(b) the other, that he owed this entirely to the Lord.<p>He had no power to defend himself, and yet he felt assured that he would be safe - for he put his trust entirely in the Lord. The whole language implies unwavering trust or confidence in God, and is thus instructive and useful for all. It teaches us:<p>(1) that in the midst of troubles we may put our trust in God; and<p>(2) that religion is adapted to make the mind calm in such circumstances, and to enable its possessor to lie down without anxiety in the slumbers of the night, and to pursue without anxiety the duties of the day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. both lay me down, &c.&#8212;or, will lie down at once, and sleep in sure confidence and quiet repose (Ps 3:5).   <a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/4.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.<p>Sweet Evening Hymn!

Armed men kept the bed of Solomon, but we do not believe that he slept more soundly than his father, whose bed was the hard ground, and who was haunted by blood-thirsty foes. Note the word "only," which means that God alone was his keeper, and that though alone, without man's help, he was even then in good keeping, for he was "alone with God." A quiet conscience is a good bedfellow. How many of our sleepless hours might be traced to our untrusting and disordered minds. They slumber sweetly whom faith rocks to sleep. No pillow so soft as a promise; no coverlet so warm as an assured interest in Christ.<p>O Lord, give us this calm repose on thee, that like David we may lie down in peace, and sleep each night while we live; and joyfully may we lie down in the appointed season, to sleep in death, to rest in God<p>Dr. Hawker's reflection upon this Psalm is worthy to be prayed over and fed upon with sacred delight. We cannot help transcribing it.<p>"Reader! let us never lose sight of the Lord Jesus while reading this psalm. He is the Lord our righteousness; and therefore, in all our approaches to the mercy seat, let us go there in a language corresponding to this which calls Jesus the Lord our righteousness. While men of the world, from the world are seeking their chief good, let us desire his favour which infinitely transcends corn and wine, and all the good things which perish in the using. Yes, Lord, thy favour is better than life itself. Thou causest them that love thee to inherit substance, and fillest all their treasure.<p>Oh! thou gracious God and Father, hast thou in such a wonderful manner set apart one in our nature for thyself? Hast thou indeed chosen ode out of the people? Hast thou beheld him in the purity of his nature, - as one in every point godly? Hast thou given him as the covenant of the people? And hast thou declared thyself well pleased in him? Oh I then, well may my soul be well pleased in him also. Now do I know that my God and Father will hear me when I call upon him in Jesus' name, and when I look up to him for acceptance for Jesus' sake.<p>Yes, my heart is fixed, O Lord, my heart is fixed; Jesus is my hope and righteousness, the Lord will hear me when I call. And henceforth will I both lay me down in peace and sleep securely in Jesus, accepted in the Beloved; for this is the rest wherewith the Lord causeth the weary to rest, and this is the refreshing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Both:</span> this word relates to the two following verbs; as soon as I am laid down, I will quietly compose myself to sleep; whereas many lie down upon their beds, and cannot sleep through distracting cares or troubles.

In this and the preceding Psalm David makes as little mention of his degenerate son as he does of the deluded king in the Psalms belonging to the period of his persecution by Saul. The address is directed to the aristocratic party, whose tool Absolom has become. To these he days: till when (&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492; beside the non-guttural which follows with Segol, without any manifest reason, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-13.htm">Psalm 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-10.htm">Jeremiah 16:10</a>), i.e., how long shall my honour become a mockery, namely to you and by you, just as we can also say in Latin quousque tandem dignitas mea ludibrio? The two following members are circumstantial clauses subordinate to the principal clause with &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492; (similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>; Ew. 341, b). The energetic fut. with Nun parag. does not usually stand at the head of independent clauses; it is therefore to be rendered: since ye love &#1512;&#1497;&#1511;, that which is empty - the proper name for their high rank is hollow appearance - how long will ye pursue after &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;, falsehood?-they seek to find out every possible lying pretext, in order to trail the honour of the legitimate king in the dust. The assertion that the personal honour of David, not his kingly dignity, is meant by &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;, separates what is inseparable. They are eager to injure his official at the same time as his personal reputation. Therefore David appeals in opposition to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-4.htm">Psalm 4:4</a>) not only to the divine choice, but also to his personal relationship to God, on which that choice is based. The &#1493; of &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-41.htm">2 Kings 4:41</a>, the &#1493; of sequence: so know then. The Hiph. &#1495;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, cogn. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, prop. to divide) to make a separation, make a distinction <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-4.htm">Exodus 9:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-7.htm">Exodus 11:7</a>, then to distinguish in an extraordinary and remarkable way <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18</a>, and to show <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-22.htm">Psalm 31:22</a>, so that consequently what is meant is not the mere selection (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;), but the remarkable selection to a remarkable position of honour (lxx, Vulg. mirificavit, Windberg translation of the Psalms gewunderlichet). &#1500;&#1493; belongs to the verb, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-4.htm">Psalm 135:4</a>, and the principal accent lies on &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;: he whom Jahve Himself, not men, has thus remarkably distinguished is a &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;, a pious man, i.e., either, like the Syriac &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1488;  equals  &#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1488;: God's favourite, or, according to the biblical usage of the language (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>), in an active signification like &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;, and the like: a lover of God, from &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (root &#1495;&#1505; Arab. h&#803;s, stringere, whence h&#803;assa to curry, mah&#803;assa a curry-comb) prop. to feel one's self drawn, i.e., strongly affected (comp. h&#803;iss is mental impression), in Hebrew, of a strong ardent affection. As a &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491; he does not call upon God in vain, but finds a ready hearing. Their undertaking consequently runs counter to the miraculously evidenced will of God and must fail by reason of the loving relationship in which the dethroned and debased one stands to God. </body></html>
