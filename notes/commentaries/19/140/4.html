The poet now turns towards these enemies of God in profound vexation of spirit. The &#1488;&#1501;, which is conditional in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>, here is an optative o si, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>. The expression &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468; reminds one of the Book of Job, for, with the exception of our Psalm, this is the only book that uses the verb &#1511;&#1496;&#1500;, which is more Aramaic than Hebrew, and the divine name Eloah occurs more frequently in it than anywhere else. The transition from the optative to the imperative &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is difficult; it would have been less so if the Waw copul. had been left out: cf. the easier expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-115.htm">Psalm 119:115</a>. But we may not on this account seek to read &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, as Olshausen does. Everything here is remarkable; the whole Psalm has a characteristic form in respect to the language. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; is the ground-form of the overloaded &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, and is also like the Book of Job, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-16.htm">Job 21:16</a>, cf. &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a>. The mode of writing &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; (instead of which, however, the Babylonian texts had &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;) is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-15.htm">2 Samuel 19:15</a>, cf. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a> the same melting away of the Aleph into the preceding vowel in connection with &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-40.htm">2 Samuel 22:40</a> in connection with &#1488;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a> with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;. Construed with the accusative of the person, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; here signifies to declare any one, profiteri, a meaning which, we confess, does not occur elsewhere. But &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. &#1500;&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>; the Targum: who swear by Thy name for wantonness) and the parallel member of the verse, which as it runs is moulded after <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, show that it has not to be read &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; (Quinta: &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;). The form &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, with Aleph otians, is also remarkable; it ought at least to have been written &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. &#1504;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8</a>) instead of the customary &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;; yet the same mode of writing is found in the Niphal in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>, &#1497;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, it assumes a ground-form &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>)  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, and is to be judged of according to &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a> [Ges. 23, 3, rem. 3]. Also one feels the absence of the object to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;. It is meant to be supplied according to the decalogue, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, which certainly makes the alteration &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; (Bttcher, Olsh.) or &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1498; (Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>), instead of &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, natural. But the text as we now have it is also intelligible: the object to &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488; is derived from &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1498;, and the following &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is an explanation of the subject intended in &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488; that is introduced subsequently. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a> proves the possibility of this structure of a clause. It is correctly rendered by Aquila &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, and Symmachus &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. &#1506;&#1512;, an enemy, prop. one who is zealous, a zealot (from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, or rather &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;,  equals  Arab. ga&#770;r, med. Je, &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, whence &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, Arab. gayrat  equals  &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;), is a word that is guaranteed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-16.htm">1 Samuel 28:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a>, and as being an Aramaism is appropriate to this Psalm. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; for &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; has cast away the preformative Mem (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-11.htm">Deuteronomy 23:11</a> for &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;); the suffix is to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>. Pasek stands between &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492; in order that the two words may not be read together (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-13.htm">Job 27:13</a>, and above <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3</a>). &#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1496;&#1496; as in the recent <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-158.htm">Psalm 119:158</a>. The emphasis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-22.htm">Psalm 139:22</a> lies on &#1500;&#1497;; the poet regards the adversaries of God as enemies of his own. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514; takes the place of the adjective: extremo (odio) odi eos. Such is the relation of the poet to the enemies of God, but without indulging any self-glorying. </body></html>
