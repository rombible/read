The idea here is, that since the tongue of the serpent "seems" to be sharp, pointed, adapted to penetrate (and probably the original reference in the image was derived from that idea), the wound inflicted is by the serpent's tongue - "as if" with a hard, penetrating point. It is now known, however, that it is by a tooth - a single tooth, made flexible for the purpose - at the root of which a small bag containing the poison is located, which is injected through an orifice in the tooth into the wound. The meaning here is, that the words spoken by such persons - by their tongues - were like the poison produced by the bite of a serpent.<p>Adders' poison is under their lips - The asp or adder is among the most poisonous of serpents. Thus, Cleopatra of Egypt is said to have destroyed her own life by an asp, which she had concealed for that purpose. This passage is quoted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-13.htm">Romans 3:13</a>, as a proof of human depravity.

The poet now turns towards these enemies of God in profound vexation of spirit. The &#1488;&#1501;, which is conditional in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>, here is an optative o si, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>. The expression &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468; reminds one of the Book of Job, for, with the exception of our Psalm, this is the only book that uses the verb &#1511;&#1496;&#1500;, which is more Aramaic than Hebrew, and the divine name Eloah occurs more frequently in it than anywhere else. The transition from the optative to the imperative &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is difficult; it would have been less so if the Waw copul. had been left out: cf. the easier expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-115.htm">Psalm 119:115</a>. But we may not on this account seek to read &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, as Olshausen does. Everything here is remarkable; the whole Psalm has a characteristic form in respect to the language. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; is the ground-form of the overloaded &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, and is also like the Book of Job, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-16.htm">Job 21:16</a>, cf. &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a>. The mode of writing &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; (instead of which, however, the Babylonian texts had &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;) is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-15.htm">2 Samuel 19:15</a>, cf. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a> the same melting away of the Aleph into the preceding vowel in connection with &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-40.htm">2 Samuel 22:40</a> in connection with &#1488;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a> with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;. Construed with the accusative of the person, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; here signifies to declare any one, profiteri, a meaning which, we confess, does not occur elsewhere. But &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. &#1500;&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>; the Targum: who swear by Thy name for wantonness) and the parallel member of the verse, which as it runs is moulded after <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, show that it has not to be read &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; (Quinta: &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;). The form &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, with Aleph otians, is also remarkable; it ought at least to have been written &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. &#1504;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8</a>) instead of the customary &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;; yet the same mode of writing is found in the Niphal in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>, &#1497;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, it assumes a ground-form &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>)  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, and is to be judged of according to &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a> [Ges. 23, 3, rem. 3]. Also one feels the absence of the object to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;. It is meant to be supplied according to the decalogue, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, which certainly makes the alteration &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; (Bttcher, Olsh.) or &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1498; (Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>), instead of &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, natural. But the text as we now have it is also intelligible: the object to &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488; is derived from &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1498;, and the following &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is an explanation of the subject intended in &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488; that is introduced subsequently. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a> proves the possibility of this structure of a clause. It is correctly rendered by Aquila &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, and Symmachus &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. &#1506;&#1512;, an enemy, prop. one who is zealous, a zealot (from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, or rather &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;,  equals  Arab. ga&#770;r, med. Je, &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, whence &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, Arab. gayrat  equals  &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;), is a word that is guaranteed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-16.htm">1 Samuel 28:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a>, and as being an Aramaism is appropriate to this Psalm. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; for &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; has cast away the preformative Mem (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-11.htm">Deuteronomy 23:11</a> for &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;); the suffix is to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>. Pasek stands between &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492; in order that the two words may not be read together (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-13.htm">Job 27:13</a>, and above <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3</a>). &#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1496;&#1496; as in the recent <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-158.htm">Psalm 119:158</a>. The emphasis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-22.htm">Psalm 139:22</a> lies on &#1500;&#1497;; the poet regards the adversaries of God as enemies of his own. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514; takes the place of the adjective: extremo (odio) odi eos. Such is the relation of the poet to the enemies of God, but without indulging any self-glorying. </body></html>
