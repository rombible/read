The LXX. and Vulg. give the first clause thus: “Give me not over to the enemy, by reason of their own desire;” which may possibly have been in St. Paul’s mind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Further not.—</span>The text of this clause has undoubtedly suffered. The Authorised Version follows the LXX. and Vulg. in inserting a negative before the last word. These versions also take the word rendered “wicked devices” as a verb, not finding a noun of the form anywhere else: “They have plotted against me: desert me not, lest they exalt themselves.” So also Symmachus, and another Greek version quoted by Origen.<p>As the text at present stands, we must render: <span class= "ital">his plot do not further</span>—<span class= "ital">they lift up. </span>Looking on to the next verse, “the head of those surrounding me,” the suggestion at once arises that the verb <span class= "ital">lift up </span>properly belongs to this clause:<p>“His plot do not further.<p>They lift the head, these surrounding me.”<p>This arrangement disregards the “selah.” and also obliges us to suspect that a clause has dropped cut after the first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-9.htm" title="As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.">Psalm 140:9</a>—a suspicion confirmed by the rhythm.<span class= "note">[20]<p>[20] Mr. Burgess amends to “Further not his plot to his exaltation.”</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/140.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>140:8-13 Believers may pray that God would not grant the desires of the wicked, nor further their evil devices. False accusers will bring mischief upon themselves, even the burning coals of Divine vengeance. And surely the righteous shall dwell in God's presence, and give him thanks for evermore. This is true thanksgiving, even thanks-living: this use we should make of all our deliverances, we should serve God the more closely and cheerfully. Those who, though evil spoken of and ill-used by men, are righteous in the sight of God, being justified by the righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to them, and received by faith, as the effect of which, they live soberly and righteously; these give thanks to the Lord, for the righteousness whereby they are made righteous, and for every blessing of grace, and mercy of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/140.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked - That is, in the matter under consideration. Let them not accomplish their desire in my destruction. Let them not succeed in their designs against me. The prayer, however, "may" be used more generally. It is proper to pray that the desires of the wicked, as wicked people, may not be granted to them; that they may "not" be successful in their purposes. Success in such desires would be only an injury to themselves and to the world. It is proper to pray that the purposes of the wicked may be defeated, and that they may be led to abandon their designs and to seek better ends. For this, in fact, we always pray when we pray for their conversion.<p>Further not his wicked device - His purpose against me.<p>Lest they exalt themselves - Lest they attribute it to their own skill, wisdom, or valor, and lest they pride themselves on their success. To succeed in a righteous cause makes a man humble and grateful; in a bad cause, proud, and forgetful of God. The margin here is, "Let them not be exalted." The meaning is, that success would at the same time elate them in their own estimation, and increase their bad influence in the world. It is, on every account, a benevolent prayer that wicked people may "not" be successful in their plans of iniquity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/140.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Of Doeg, as the Targum, and of other wicked men, who were desirous both of taking him, and of taking away his life: but the desires of such men are under the restraints of the Lord; nor can they fulfil them unless they have leave from him, which is here deprecated. The psalmist entreats he might not be delivered up to their will, or they have their will of him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>. Jarchi interprets it of Esau, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-1.htm">Psalm 140:1</a>; and it is applicable enough to antichrist and his wicked followers; who, could they have their desires, would root the Gospel, and the interest of Christ and his people, out of the world; <p>further not his wicked device: or, "let not his wicked device come forth" (l), or proceed to execution, or be brought to perfection; let him be disappointed in it, that he may not be able to perform his enterprise, or execute his designs; which cannot be done without the divine permission. The Rabbins, as Jarchi and others, render it, "let not his bridle come out" (m); the bridle out of his jaws, with which he was held by the Lord, and restrained from doing his will; let him not be left to his liberty, and freed from the restraints of divine Providence; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a>; <p>lest they exalt themselves. Grow proud, haughty, and insolent to God and man; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>. Or, "let them not be exalted" (n); upon the ruin of me and my friends. <p>Selah; on this word; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <p>(l)  "ne facias prodire", Vatablus; "ne sinas exire", Cocceius, Michaelis.

The relative clause shows that &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; is not intended to be understood exclusively of one person. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; strengthens the notion of that which is deeply concealed and premeditated. It is doubtful whether &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; signifies to form into troops or to stir up. But from the fact that &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-15.htm">Isaiah 54:15</a>, signifies not congregare but se congregare, it is to be inferred that &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in the passage before us, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (or &#1492;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>), in Syriac and Targumic &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;, signifies concitare, to excite (cf. &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; together with &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a>.).

They sharpen their tongue, so that it inflicts a fatal sting like the tongue of a serpent, and under their lips, shooting out from thence, is the poison of the adder (cf.

The root is apparently expanded into &#1506;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489; by an added Beth which serves as a notional speciality, as in Arab. &#8219;rqu&#770;b the convex bend of the steep side of a rock, or in the case of the knee of the hind-legs of animals, and in Arab. charnu&#770;b (in the dialect of the country along the coast of Palestine, where the tree is plentiful, in Neshwn churnu&#770;b), the horn-like curved pod of the carob-tree (Ceratonia Siliqua), syncopated Arab. charru&#770;b, charru&#770;b (not charu&#770;b), from Arab. charn, cogn. qarn, a horn, cf.
