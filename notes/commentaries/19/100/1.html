Great encouragement is given us, in worshipping God, to do it cheerfully. If, when we strayed like wandering sheep, he has brought us again to his fold, we have indeed abundant cause to bless his name. The matter of praise, and the motives to it, are very important. Know ye what God is in himself, and what he is to you. Know it; consider and apply it, then you will be more close and constant, more inward and serious, in his worship. The covenant of grace set down in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, with so many rich promises, to strengthen the faith of every weak believer, makes the matter of God's praise and of his people's joys so sure, that how sad soever our spirits may be when we look to ourselves, yet we shall have reason to praise the Lord when we look to his goodness and mercy, and to what he has said in his word for our comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/100.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make a joyful noise unto the Lord - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-1.htm">Psalm 95:1</a>.<p>All ye lands - Margin, as in Hebrew, "all the earth." The margin expresses the sense. The idea in the psalm is, that praise did not pertain to one nation only; that it was not appropriate for one people merely; that it should not be confined to the Hebrew people, but that there was a proper ground of praise for "all;" there was that in which all nations, of all languages and conditions, could unite. The ground of that was the fact that they had one Creator, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>. The psalm is based on the unity of the human race; on the fact that there is one God and Father of all, and one great family on earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/100.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 100<p>Ps 100:1-5.

This is a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-4.htm">Psalm 98:4</a>. The original word signifies a glad shout, such as loyal subjects give when their king appears among them. Our happy God should be worshipped by a happy people; a cheerful spirit is in keeping with his nature, his acts, and the gratitude which we should cherish for his mercies in every land Jehovah's goodness is seen, therefore in every land should he be praised. Never will the world be in its proper condition till with one unanimous shout it adores the only God. O ye nations, how long will ye blindly reject him? Your golden age will never arrive till ye with all your hearts revere him.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-2.htm">Psalm 100:2</a><p>"Serve the Lord with gladness." "Glad homage pay with awful mirth." He is our Lord, and therefore he is to be served; he is our gracious Lord, and therefore to be served with joy. The invitation to worship here given is not a melancholy one, as though adoration were a funeral solemnity, but a cheery, gladsome exhortation, as though we were bidden to a marriage feast. "Come before his presence with singing." We ought in worship to realise the presence of God, and by an effort of the mind to approach him. This is an act which must to every rightly instructed heart be one of great solemnity, but at the same time it must not be performed in the servility of fear, and therefore we come before him, not with weepings and wailings, but with Psalms and hymns. Singing, as it is a joyful, and at the same time a devout, exercise, should be a constant form of approach to God. The measured, harmonious, hearty utterance of praise by a congregation of really devout persons is not merely decorous but delightful, and is a fit anticipation of the worship of heaven, where praise has absorbed prayer, and become the sole mode of adoration. How a certain society of brethren can find it in their hearts to forbid singing in public worship is a riddle which we cannot solve. We feel inclined to say with Dr. Watts - <p>"Let those refuse to sing<p>Who never knew our God;<p>But favourites of the heavenly king<p>Must speak his praise abroad"<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a><p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm seems to have been composed for the use of the Israelites in their thank-offerings, or upon other solemn occasions of praising God, as the title speaks; but withal it hath a further prospect, even to the days of the Messiah, as some of the Hebrew doctors acknowledge, and to the calling of the Gentiles, whom he invites to join with them in the praises of God their Lord and Maker. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An exhortation to praise God joyfully, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-1.htm" title="Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all you lands.">Psalm 100:1</a>,2</span>, for his greatness, power, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-3.htm" title="Know you that the LORD he is God: it is he that has made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.">Psalm 100:3</a>,4</span>, goodness, and faithfulness to his church, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-5.htm" title="For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endures to all generations.">Psalm 100:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">Make a joyful noise; </span> partly with voices and songs of rejoicing and thanksgiving; and partly with musical instruments, as the manner then was. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All ye lands; </span> all the inhabitants of the earth.

The majority of expositors construe it: "And (they shall praise) the might of the king, who loves right;" but this joining of the clause on to &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; over the refrain that stands in the way is hazardous. Neither can &#1493;&#1506;&#1494; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;, however, be an independent clause, since &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; cannot be said of &#1506;&#1494;, but only of its possessor. And the dividing of the verse at &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;, adopted by the lxx, will therefore not hold good. &#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; is an attributive clause to &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; in the same position as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>; and &#1506;&#1494;, with what appertains to it, is the object to &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468; placed first, which has the king's throne as its object elsewhere (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-12.htm">1 Chronicles 17:12</a>), just as it here has the might of the king, which, however, here at the same time in &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; takes another and permutative object (cf. the permutative subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>), as Hitzig observes; or rather, since &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is most generally used as an adverbial notion, this &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>, and frequently), usually as a definition of the mode of the judging and reigning, is subordinated: and the might of a king who loves the right, i.e., of one who governs not according to dynastic caprice but moral precepts, hast Thou established in spirit and aim (directed to righteousness and equity). What is meant is the theocratic kingship, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a> says what Jahve has constantly accomplished by means of this kingship: He has thus maintained right and righteousness (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-14.htm">1 Chronicles 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>) among His people. Out of this manifestation of God's righteousness, which is more conspicuous, and can be better estimated, within the nation of the history of redemption than elsewhere, grows the call to highly exalt Jahve the God of Israel, and to bow one's self very low at His footstool. &#1500;&#1492;&#1491;&#1501; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>, is not a statement of the object (for <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a> is of another kind), but (like &#1488;&#1500; in other instances) of the place in which, or of the direction (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-14.htm">Psalm 7:14</a>) in which the &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is to take place.
