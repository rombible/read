Great encouragement is given us, in worshipping God, to do it cheerfully. If, when we strayed like wandering sheep, he has brought us again to his fold, we have indeed abundant cause to bless his name. The matter of praise, and the motives to it, are very important. Know ye what God is in himself, and what he is to you. Know it; consider and apply it, then you will be more close and constant, more inward and serious, in his worship. The covenant of grace set down in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, with so many rich promises, to strengthen the faith of every weak believer, makes the matter of God's praise and of his people's joys so sure, that how sad soever our spirits may be when we look to ourselves, yet we shall have reason to praise the Lord when we look to his goodness and mercy, and to what he has said in his word for our comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/100.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Serve the Lord with gladness - That is, In your worship, and in all your acts of obedience. Let there be joy in this service. Let it not be with the fear of slaves; not as a matter of compulsion and force; not with reluctance, moroseness, or gloom. Let it be a cheerful, happy service; let it be freely rendered, let it be an occasion of joy to the soul. The service of God is a source of the highest joy that man knows.<p>Come before his presence with singing - As expressive of joy. So the birds sing; so nature rejoices; so should man - intelligent, redeemed, immortal man, be joyful. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/100.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 100<p>Ps 100:1-5.

The majority of expositors construe it: "And (they shall praise) the might of the king, who loves right;" but this joining of the clause on to &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; over the refrain that stands in the way is hazardous. Neither can &#1493;&#1506;&#1494; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;, however, be an independent clause, since &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; cannot be said of &#1506;&#1494;, but only of its possessor. And the dividing of the verse at &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;, adopted by the lxx, will therefore not hold good. &#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; is an attributive clause to &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; in the same position as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>; and &#1506;&#1494;, with what appertains to it, is the object to &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468; placed first, which has the king's throne as its object elsewhere (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-12.htm">1 Chronicles 17:12</a>), just as it here has the might of the king, which, however, here at the same time in &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; takes another and permutative object (cf. the permutative subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>), as Hitzig observes; or rather, since &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is most generally used as an adverbial notion, this &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>, and frequently), usually as a definition of the mode of the judging and reigning, is subordinated: and the might of a king who loves the right, i.e., of one who governs not according to dynastic caprice but moral precepts, hast Thou established in spirit and aim (directed to righteousness and equity). What is meant is the theocratic kingship, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a> says what Jahve has constantly accomplished by means of this kingship: He has thus maintained right and righteousness (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-14.htm">1 Chronicles 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>) among His people. Out of this manifestation of God's righteousness, which is more conspicuous, and can be better estimated, within the nation of the history of redemption than elsewhere, grows the call to highly exalt Jahve the God of Israel, and to bow one's self very low at His footstool. &#1500;&#1492;&#1491;&#1501; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>, is not a statement of the object (for <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a> is of another kind), but (like &#1488;&#1500; in other instances) of the place in which, or of the direction (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-14.htm">Psalm 7:14</a>) in which the &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is to take place. The temple is called Jahve's footstool (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>) with reference to the ark, the capporeth of which corresponds to the transparent sapphire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>) and to the crystal-like firmament of the mercaba (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-18.htm">1 Chronicles 28:18</a>). </body></html>
