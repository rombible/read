The folly of such as revile his gospel and his servants will be plain to all. Let us call upon our God to enlighten the dark nations of the earth; and to rescue his people, that the poor and needy may praise his name. Blessed Saviour, thou art the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Make thy people more than conquerors. Be thou, Lord, all in all to them in every situation and circumstances; for then thy poor and needy people will praise thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/74.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forget not the voice of thine enemies - The voice of thine enemies clamoring for the destruction of thy people. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>. The prayer is, that God would bring deserved chastisement upon them for their purposes and their aims against his people. It is not necessarily a prayer for vengeance; it is a prayer for just retribution.<p>The tumult of those that rise up against thee - Of those that make war on thee, and on thy people. The word ""tumult" here means clamor or shout - as the shout of battle. The reference is to the movement of a host pressing on to conquest, encouraging and exciting each other, and endeavoring to intimidate their enemies by the loud clamor of the war-cry. It is a description of what had occurred among the main events referred to in the psalm, when the enemy came in to lay waste the capital, and to spread desolation throughout the land.<p>Increaseth continually - Margin, as in Hebrew, "Ascendeth." That is, it seems to go up; it is the swelling clamor of a great multitude of warriors intent on conquest. A cry or clamor thus seems to swell or rise on the air, and (as it were) to ascend to God. The prayer here is, that God would regard that cry, not in the sense that he would grant them the fulfillment of their wishes, but in the sense that he would recompense them as they deserved. It is in this sense that the clamors of the wicked ascend to heaven - in this sense that God will regard them, as if they were a prayer for just retribution. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/74.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22, 23.

The poet now draws comfort by looking back into the time when God as Israel's King unfolded the rich fulness of His salvation everywhere upon the earth, where Israel's existence was imperilled. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, not only within the circumference of the Holy Land, but, e.g., also within that of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18-22</a>). The poet has Egypt directly in his mind, for there now follows first of all a glance at the historical (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-15</a>), and then at the natural displays of God's power (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-16.htm">Psalm 74:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-17.htm">Psalm 74:17</a>). Hengstenberg is of opinion that <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-15</a> also are to be understood in the latter sense, and appeals to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11-13</a>. But just as Isaiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>) transfers these emblems of the omnipotence of God in the natural world to His proofs of power in connection with the history of redemption which were exhibited in the case of a worldly power, so does the poet here also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-15</a>. The &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1503; (the extended saurian) is in Isaiah, as in Ezekiel (&#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>), an emblem of Pharaoh and of his kingdom; in like manner here the leviathan is the proper natural wonder of Egypt. As a water-snake or a crocodile, when it comes up with its head above the water, is killed by a powerful stroke, did God break the heads of the Egyptians, so that the sea cast up their dead bodies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). The &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the dwellers in the steppe, to whom these became food, are not the Aethiopians (lxx, Jerome), or rather the Ichthyophagi (Bocahrt, Hengstenberg), who according to Agatharcides fed &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, but were no cannibals, but the wild beasts of the desert, which are called &#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25</a>. the ants and the rock-badgers. &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; is a permutative of the notion &#1500;&#1506;&#1501;, which was not completed: to a (singular) people, viz., to the wild animals of the steppe. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a> also still refers not to miracles of creation, but to miracles wrought in the course of the history of redemption; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a> refers to the giving of water out of the rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a>), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a> to the passage through the Jordan, which was miraculously dried up (&#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-23.htm">Joshua 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>). The object &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is intended as referring to the result: so that the water flowed out of the cleft after the manner of a fountain and a brook. &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; are the several streams of the one Jordan; the attributive genitive &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; describe them as streams having an abundance that does not dry up, streams of perennial fulness. The God of Israel who has thus marvellously made Himself known in history is, however, the Creator and Lord of all created things. Day and night and the stars alike are His creatures. In close connection with the night, which is mentioned second, the moon, the &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; of the night, precedes the sun; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is the same as &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; in this passage. It is an error to render thus: bodies of light, and more particularly the sun; which would have made one expect &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; before the specializing Waw. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; are not merely the bounds of the land towards the sea, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>, but, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>, even the boundaries of the land in themselves, that is to say, the natural boundaries of the inland country. &#1511;&#1497;&#1509; &#1493;&#1495;&#1512;&#1507; are the two halves of the year: summer including spring (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;), which begins in Nisan, the spring-month, about the time of the vernal equinox, and autumn including winter (&#1510;&#1514;&#1493;), after the termination of which the strictly spring vegetation begins (Sol 2:11). The seasons are personified, and are called God's formations or works, as it were the angels of summer and of winter. </body></html>
