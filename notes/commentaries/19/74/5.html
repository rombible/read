Literally the words run, <span class= "ital">he </span>(or <span class= "ital">it</span>)<span class= "ital"> is known like one causing to come in on high against the thicket of trees axes, </span>which is generally understood, <span class= "ital">it seems as if men were lifting up axes against a thicket of trees. </span>The ruthless destroyers go to work like woodcutters in a forest—the carved pillars are no more than so many trees to fell. But though this is intelligible, it does not read like Hebrew, and the contrast apparently intended between the <span class= "ital">signs </span>of the heathen and the <span class= "ital">signs </span>of Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-9.htm" title="We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knows how long.">Psalm 74:9</a> is not preserved. If, with the LXX., we read the verb in the plural, <span class= "ital">are known </span>instead of <span class= "ital">is known, </span>and supply the subject from the last clause, we get this contrast clearly brought out:<p>“They have set up their idols as signs,<p>They (these signs) are known in the lifting up on high.”<p>“These visible idols are easily seen and recognised as soon as set up, but (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-9.htm" title="We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knows how long.">Psalm 74:9</a>) we see not our signs.”<p><span class= "bld">According as . . .</span>—We have now, as so frequently, to supply the sign of comparison, and this clause with the next verse runs plainly enough—<p>“As in a thicket of trees with axes,<p>So now they break down all the carved work thereof with<p>axes and hammers.”<p>The “carved work” of Solomon’s Temple represented <span class= "ital">palm-trees </span>and flowers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm" title="And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.">1Kings 6:29</a>), and possibly these were imitated in the second Temple; if so, the image is very appropriate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/74.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/74-5.htm" title="A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes on the thick trees....">Psalm 74:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">A man was famous, </span>&c. — The meaning, according to this translation, is this: The temple was so noble a structure, that it was a great honour to any man to be employed in the meanest part of the work, though it were but in cutting down the trees of Lebanon. And this interpretation is favoured by the opposition in the next verse. <span class="ital">But now, </span>&c. — Some learned expositors, however, translate the first words of this verse, <span class="greekheb">יודע</span>, not, <span class="ital">He was famous, </span>but, as is more literal, <span class="ital">It is, </span>or <span class="ital">will be, well known; </span>and they interpret the two verses thus: “It is, or rather, will be, known or manifest; it will be published to all posterity, as matter of astonishment and admiration, that, as one lifteth up axes in the thick wood, or upon thick trees, to cut them down; so now they, the enemies above mentioned, break down the carved wood thereof, namely, of the sanctuary, with axes and hammers.” It has been ingeniously observed by some, that the two words thus rendered are not Hebrew, but <span class="ital">Chaldee </span>or <span class="ital">Syriac </span>words, to point out the time when this was done, even when the Chaldeans brought in their language, together with their arms, among the Israelites. Dr. Horne thinks that the Hebrew word above mentioned may be translated <span class="ital">a knowing, </span>or skilful person; and then the sense is, “As a skilful person, who understands his business, lifteth up the axe in the thick wood, so now men set themselves to work to demolish the ornaments and timbers of the sanctuary.” They neither regard the sacredness of the place, nor the exquisite curiosity and art of the work, (here signified by the term <span class="ital">carved work,</span>) but cut it down as indifferently and rashly as men cut down the thick and entangled boughs of the trees of the forest. “The words,” adds Dr. H., “suggest another reason why God should arise and have mercy upon Zion, lest his name should be blasphemed among the nations, when they saw and heard of the sacrilegious and horrible destruction wrought by the enemy; whom neither the majesty of the temple, nor the reverence of its divine inhabitant, could restrain from defacing the beauty of holiness. The ornaments of the internal and spiritual temple sometimes suffer as much from the fury of inordinate affections, as the carved work of the sanctuary ever did from the armies of Nebuchadnezzar or Antiochus.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>74:1-11 This psalm appears to describe the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by the Chaldeans. The deplorable case of the people of God, at the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/74.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man was famous - literally, "He is known;" or, shall be known. That is, he was or shall be celebrated.<p>According as he had lifted up axes - literally, "As one raising on high axes;" that is, as one lifts up his axe high in the air in order to strike an effectual stroke.<p>Upon the thick trees - The clumps of trees; the trees standing thick together. That is, As he showed skill and ability in cutting these down, and laying them low. His celebrity was founded on the rapidity with which the strokes of the axe fell on the trees, and his success in laying low the pride of the forest. According to our common translation the meaning is, that "formerly" a man derived his fame from his skill and success in wielding his axe so as to lay the forest low, but that "now" his fame was to be derived from another source, namely, the skill and power with which he cut down the elaborately-carved work of the sanctuary, despoiled the columns of their ornaments, and demolished the columns themselves. But another interpretation may be given to this, as has been suggested by Prof. Alexander. It is, that "the ruthless enemy is known or recognized as dealing with the sanctuary no more tenderly than a woodman with the forest which he fells." The former, however, is the more natural, as well as the more common interpretation. Luther renders it, "One sees the axe glitter on high, as one cuts wood in the forest." The Vulgate, and the Septuagint, "The signs pointing to the entrance above that they did not know." What idea was attached to this rendering, it is impossible to determine. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/74.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6. Though some terms and clauses here are very obscure, the general sense is that the spoilers destroyed the beauties of the temple with the violence of woodmen.<p>was famous&#8212;literally, "was known."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So the meaning is this, The temple was so noble a structure, that it was a great honour to any man to be employed in the meanest part of the work, though it were but in cutting down the trees of Lebanon. And this translation may seem to be favoured by the opposition in the next verse, <span class="ital">But now</span>, &c. But others understand the words thus translated in another sense, that every one of the enemies got renown accordingly as they showed most barbarous rage in destroying <span class="ital">the thick wood work</span> (which in the next verse is called <span class="ital">the carved work</span>) of the temple. But this seems not to suit well with the opposition between this work and that of the next verse, which is ushered in by <span class="ital">but now</span>. The words therefore may be (and in part are by some) rendered thus, <span class="ital">It is known</span>, (or <span class="ital">manifest</span>, Heb. <span class="ital">It will be known</span>; it will be published to all posterity, as matter of astonishment and admiration,) that, <span class="ital">as one lifteth up his axe</span> (Heb. <span class="ital">axes</span>, the plural number for the singular, as it is elsewhere) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">upon thick trees, </span> to cut them down.

(Heb. <span class="ital">and</span>; which is sometimes put for a note of similitude, as in that passage of the Lord’s prayer, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-10.htm" title="Your kingdom come, Your will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.">Matthew 6:10</a></span>, <span class="ital">as it is in heaven</span>; and oft in the book of the Proverbs) now (for though this Psalm was composed after the thing was done, yet he speaks of it as if it were now in doing, as the manner of the sacred writers frequently is, that it may be more livelily represented to men’s minds) <span class="ital">they break down the carved works</span>, &c. The meaning is, they neither regard the sacredness of the place, nor the exquisite curiosity and art of the work, but cut it down as indifferently and rashly as men cut down the thick and entangled boughs of the trees of the forest. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/74.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>A man was famous,....

The central point of the confirmation that is introduced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; lies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-28.htm">Psalm 73:28</a>. "Thy far removing ones" was to be expressed with &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;, which is distinct from &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511;. &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; has &#1502;&#1503; instead of &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; or &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; after it. Those who remove themselves far from the primary fountain of life fall a prey to ruin; those who faithlessly abandon God, and choose the world with its idols rather than His love, fall a prey to destruction. Not so the poet; the nearness of God, i.e., a state of union with God, is good to him, i.e., (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-71.htm">Psalm 119:71</a>.) he regards as his good fortune. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; is nom. act. after the form &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1492;, Arab. waqhat, obedience, and &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, a watch, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>, and of essentially the same signification with k&#803;urba (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;), the Arabic designation of the unio mystica; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;. Just as &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; stands in antithesis to &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1498;, so &#1500;&#1497; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; stands in antithesis to &#1497;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493; and &#1492;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514;&#1492;. To the former their alienation from God brings destruction; he finds in fellowship with God that which is good to him for the present time and for the future. Putting his confidence (&#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;, not &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;) in Him, he will declare, and will one day be able to declare, all His &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., the manifestations or achievements of His righteous, gracious, and wise government. The language of assertion is quickly changed into that of address. The Psalm closes with an upward look of grateful adoration to God beforehand, who leads His own people, ofttimes wondrously indeed, but always happily, viz., through suffering to glory. </body></html>
