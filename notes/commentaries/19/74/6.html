The deplorable case of the people of God, at the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/74.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But now they break down the carved work thereof ... - literally, "But now the carvings of it together, at once, with sledge and hammers they beat down." The carved work refers evidently to the ornaments of the temple. The word used here - &#1508;&#1514;&#1493;&#1495;  pittu&#770;ach - is rendered engraving, carved work, or carving; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-11.htm">Exodus 28:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-21.htm">Exodus 28:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-6.htm">Exodus 39:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-14.htm">Exodus 39:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>. It is the very word which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a> is applied to the ornaments around the walls of the temple - the "carved figures of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers," and there can be no doubt that the allusion here is to those ornaments. These were rudely cut down, or knocked off, with axes and hammers, as a man lays low the trees of the wood. The phrase "at once" means that they drove forward the work with all despatch. They spared none of them. They treated them all alike as an axeman does the trees of a forest when his object is to clear the land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/74.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. carved work&#8212;(1Ki 6:29).<p>thereof&#8212;that is, of the temple, in the writer's mind, though not expressed till Ps 74:7, in which its utter destruction by fire is mentioned (2Ki 25:9; Isa 64:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-5.htm" title="A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes on the thick trees.">Psalm 74:5</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Axes and hammers:</span> it hath been ingeniously observed that these two words are not Hebrew, but Chaldee or Syriac words, to point out the time when this was done, even when the Chaldeans brought in their language together with their arms among the Israelites. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/74.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.

This superficial carved work may have been broken down for the sake of the gold with which it was overlaid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22, 32, 35</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/73.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet here once more gives expression to the great opposites into which good fortune and misfortune are seemingly, but only seemingly, divided in a manner so contradictory to the divine justice. The central point of the confirmation that is introduced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; lies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-28.htm">Psalm 73:28</a>. "Thy far removing ones" was to be expressed with &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;, which is distinct from &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511;. &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; has &#1502;&#1503; instead of &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; or &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; after it. Those who remove themselves far from the primary fountain of life fall a prey to ruin; those who faithlessly abandon God, and choose the world with its idols rather than His love, fall a prey to destruction. Not so the poet; the nearness of God, i.e., a state of union with God, is good to him, i.e., (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-71.htm">Psalm 119:71</a>.) he regards as his good fortune. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; is nom. act. after the form &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1492;, Arab. waqhat, obedience, and &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, a watch, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>, and of essentially the same signification with k&#803;urba (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;), the Arabic designation of the unio mystica; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;. Just as &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; stands in antithesis to &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1498;, so &#1500;&#1497; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; stands in antithesis to &#1497;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493; and &#1492;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514;&#1492;. To the former their alienation from God brings destruction; he finds in fellowship with God that which is good to him for the present time and for the future. Putting his confidence (&#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;, not &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;) in Him, he will declare, and will one day be able to declare, all His &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., the manifestations or achievements of His righteous, gracious, and wise government. The language of assertion is quickly changed into that of address. The Psalm closes with an upward look of grateful adoration to God beforehand, who leads His own people, ofttimes wondrously indeed, but always happily, viz., through suffering to glory. </body></html>
