The deplorable case of the people of God, at the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/74.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lift up thy feet - That is, Advance, or draw near.

That is, arise, hasten, move swiftly, and in the greatness of strength, and come and see the desolations made by the enemy, which look as if they would remain for ever; meaning either the desolations made in the city and temple of Jerusalem, either by Nebuchadnezzar, or by Titus; or the havocs and devastations made in the church of God by the tyranny and persecutions of antichrist; which have continued so long, that an end of them has been almost despaired of. So Jacob is said to "lift up his feet"; which we render went on his way, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>. Some take these words in a different sense, as a prayer for the destruction of the church's enemies; so the Targum, <p>"lift up thy feet or goings, to make desolate the nations for ever;'' <p>and Kimchi makes but one sentence of this and the following clause, and reads it thus, <p>"lift up thy feet, to make desolate for ever every enemy that does wickedly in the sanctuary:'' <p>but the accent "athnach", which divides propositions, and is upon the word  forbids such a reading. The former sense is best, and most agreeable to the context; <p>even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary; by profaning and destroying the temple, as did Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus, and Titus; or by antichrist sitting in the temple and church of God, setting up idolatrous worship in it, and blaspheming the tabernacle of God, and those that dwell therein, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/74.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/74.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">Lift up thy feet</span>] Bestir Thyself: come in might and majesty to visit and deliver. <span class="ital">the perpetual desolations</span>] R.V. the perpetual ruins: a word found elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-18.htm" title="Surely you did set them in slippery places: you cast them down into destruction.">Psalm 73:18</a>.

Even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. The Babylonians had plundered the temple of all its treasures, breaking the precious Phoenician bronze work into pieces, and carrying off everything of value that was portable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>). They had also "burnt the house of the Lord "(ver. 9), and "broken down the walls of Jerusalem" (ver. 10) and the walls of the temple to a large extent (see below, ver. 7). It is quite certain that neither Shishak nor the Syrians under Antiochus Epiphanes created any such devastation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/73.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But he does not thus deeply degrade himself: after God has once taken him by the right hand and rescued him from the danger of falling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>), he clings all the more firmly to Him, and will not suffer his perpetual fellowship with Him to be again broken through by such seizures which estrange him from God. confidently does he yield up himself to the divine guidance, though he may not see through the mystery of the plan (&#1506;&#1510;&#1492;) of this guidance. He knows that afterwards (&#1488;&#1495;&#1512; with Mugrash: adverb as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>), i.e., after this dark way of faith, God will &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; receive him, i.e., take him to Himself, and take him from all suffering (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/49-16.htm">Psalm 49:16</a>, and of Enoch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>). The comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a> [8] is misleading; there &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; is rightly accented as a preposition: after glory hath He sent me forth (vid., K&#1510;hler), and here as an adverb; for although the adverbial sense of &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; would more readily lead one to look for the arrangement of the words &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512; &#1514;&#1511;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, still "to receive after glory" (cf. the reverse <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>) is an awkward thought. &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, which as an adjective "glorious" (Hofmann) is alien to the language, is either accusative of the goal (Hupfeld), or, which yields a form of expression that is more like the style of the Old Testament, accusative of the manner (Luther, "with honour"). In &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; the poet comprehends in one summary view what he looks for at the goal of the present divine guidance. The future is dark to him, but lighted up by the one hope that the end of his earthly existence will be a glorious solution of the riddle. Here, as elsewhere, it is faith which breaks through not only the darkness of this present life, but also the night of Hades. At that time there was as yet no divine utterance concerning any heavenly triumph of the church, militant in the present world, but to faith the Jahve-Name had already a transparent depth which penetrated beyond Hades into an eternal life. The heaven of blessedness and glory also is nothing without God; but he who can in love call God his, possesses heaven upon earth, and he who cannot in love call God his, would possess not heaven, but hell, in the midst of heaven. In this sense the poet says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-25.htm">Psalm 73:25</a> : whom have I in heaven? i.e., who there without Thee would be the object of my desire, the stilling of my longing? without Thee heaven with all its glory is a vast waste and void, which makes me indifferent to everything, and with Thee, i.e., possessing Thee, I have no delight in the earth, because to call Thee mine infinitely surpasses every possession and every desire of earth. If we take &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; still more exactly as parallel to &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, without making it dependent upon &#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;: and possessing Thee I have no desire upon the earth, then the sense remains essentially the same; but if we allow &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; to be governed by &#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497; in accordance with the general usage of the language, we arrive at this meaning by the most natural way. Heaven and earth, together with angels and men, afford him no satisfaction - his only friend, his sole desire and love, is God. The love for God which David expresses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a> in the brief utterance, "Thou art my Lord, Thou art my highest good," is here expanded with incomparable mystical profoundness and beauty. Luther's version shows his master-hand. The church follows it in its "Herzlich lieb hab' ich dich" when it sings - <p>"The whole wide world delights me not,<p>For heaven and earth, Lord, care Inot,<p>If I may but have Thee;"<p>and following it, goes on in perfect harmony with the text of our Psalm - <p>"Yea, though my heart be like to break,<p>Thou art my trust that nought can shake;" <p>(Note: Miss Winkworth's translation.)<p>or with Paul Gerhard, [in his Passion-hymn "Ein Lmmlein geht und trgt die Schuld der Welt und ihrer Kinder,"<p>"Light of my heart, that shalt Thou be;<p>And when my heart in pieces breaks,<p>Thou shalt my heart remain."<p>For the hypothetical perfect &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; expresses something in spite of which he upon whom it may come calls God his God: licet defecerit. Though his outward and inward man perish, nevertheless God remains ever the rock of his heart as the firm ground upon which he, with his ego, remains standing when everything else totters; He remains his portion, i.e., the possession that cannot be taken from him, if he loses all, even his spirit-life pertaining to the body, - and God remains to him this portion &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, he survives with the life which he has in God the death of the old life. The poet supposes an extreme case, - one, that is, it is true, impossible, but yet conceivable, - that his outward and inward being should sink away; even then with the merus actus of his ego he will continue to cling to God. In the midst of the natural life of perishableness and of sin, a new, individual life which is resigned to God has begun within him, and in this he has the pledge that he cannot perish, so truly as God, with whom it is closely united, cannot perish. It is just this that is also the nerve of the proof of the resurrection of the dead which Jesus advances in opposition to the Sadducees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>). </body></html>
