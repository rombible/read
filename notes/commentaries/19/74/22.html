It ends in expostulatory prayer, with as yet no brighter gleam of hope than prayer itself implies—and that when seemingly directed to deaf ears.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>74:18-23 The psalmist begs that God would appear for the church against their enemies. The folly of such as revile his gospel and his servants will be plain to all. Let us call upon our God to enlighten the dark nations of the earth; and to rescue his people, that the poor and needy may praise his name. Blessed Saviour, thou art the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Make thy people more than conquerors. Be thou, Lord, all in all to them in every situation and circumstances; for then thy poor and needy people will praise thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/74.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arise, O God - As if God were now insensible to the wrongs and sufferings of his people; as if he were inattentive and indisposed to come to their help. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>.<p>Plead thine own cause - literally, "Contend thine own contention." That is, Maintain a cause which is really thine own. Thine own honor is concerned; thine own law and authority are assailed; the war is really made on "thee." This is always the true idea in the prayers which are offered for the conversion of sinners, for the establishment of truth, and for the spread of the Gospel in the world. It is not originally the cause of the church; it is the cause of God. Everything in regard to truth, to justice, to humanity, to temperance, to liberty, to religion, is the cause of God. All the assaults made on these, are assaults made on God.<p>Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily - Constantly. He does not cease. The word "foolish" refers to the wicked. The idea is, that the wicked constantly reproach God - either by their language or their conduct; and this is a reason for calling on him to interpose. No better reason for asking his interposition can be given, than that such conduct is a real reproach to God, and reflects on his honor in the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/74.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22, 23.

In the ancient world the conquest of a people was always regarded as a triumph over the people's god or gods. Naturally, insults to the god found a place in the victor's songs of triumph (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-10.htm">2 Kings 19:10-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8-11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/74.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With this prayer for the destruction of the enemies by God's interposition closes the first half of the Psalm, which has for its subject-matter the crying contradiction between the present state of things and God's relationship to Israel. The poet now draws comfort by looking back into the time when God as Israel's King unfolded the rich fulness of His salvation everywhere upon the earth, where Israel's existence was imperilled. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, not only within the circumference of the Holy Land, but, e.g., also within that of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18-22</a>). The poet has Egypt directly in his mind, for there now follows first of all a glance at the historical (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-15</a>), and then at the natural displays of God's power (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-16.htm">Psalm 74:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-17.htm">Psalm 74:17</a>). Hengstenberg is of opinion that <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-15</a> also are to be understood in the latter sense, and appeals to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11-13</a>. But just as Isaiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>) transfers these emblems of the omnipotence of God in the natural world to His proofs of power in connection with the history of redemption which were exhibited in the case of a worldly power, so does the poet here also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-15</a>. The &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1503; (the extended saurian) is in Isaiah, as in Ezekiel (&#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>), an emblem of Pharaoh and of his kingdom; in like manner here the leviathan is the proper natural wonder of Egypt. As a water-snake or a crocodile, when it comes up with its head above the water, is killed by a powerful stroke, did God break the heads of the Egyptians, so that the sea cast up their dead bodies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). The &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the dwellers in the steppe, to whom these became food, are not the Aethiopians (lxx, Jerome), or rather the Ichthyophagi (Bocahrt, Hengstenberg), who according to Agatharcides fed &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, but were no cannibals, but the wild beasts of the desert, which are called &#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25</a>. the ants and the rock-badgers. &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; is a permutative of the notion &#1500;&#1506;&#1501;, which was not completed: to a (singular) people, viz., to the wild animals of the steppe. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a> also still refers not to miracles of creation, but to miracles wrought in the course of the history of redemption; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a> refers to the giving of water out of the rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a>), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a> to the passage through the Jordan, which was miraculously dried up (&#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-23.htm">Joshua 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>). The object &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is intended as referring to the result: so that the water flowed out of the cleft after the manner of a fountain and a brook. &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; are the several streams of the one Jordan; the attributive genitive &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; describe them as streams having an abundance that does not dry up, streams of perennial fulness. The God of Israel who has thus marvellously made Himself known in history is, however, the Creator and Lord of all created things. Day and night and the stars alike are His creatures. In close connection with the night, which is mentioned second, the moon, the &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; of the night, precedes the sun; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is the same as &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; in this passage. It is an error to render thus: bodies of light, and more particularly the sun; which would have made one expect &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; before the specializing Waw. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; are not merely the bounds of the land towards the sea, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>, but, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>, even the boundaries of the land in themselves, that is to say, the natural boundaries of the inland country. &#1511;&#1497;&#1509; &#1493;&#1495;&#1512;&#1507; are the two halves of the year: summer including spring (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;), which begins in Nisan, the spring-month, about the time of the vernal equinox, and autumn including winter (&#1510;&#1514;&#1493;), after the termination of which the strictly spring vegetation begins (Sol 2:11). The seasons are personified, and are called God's formations or works, as it were the angels of summer and of winter. </body></html>
