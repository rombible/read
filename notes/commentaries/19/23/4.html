Indeed, the probability is that instead of <span class= "ital">tsal-mâveth </span>(shadow of death), should be read, <span class= "ital">tsalmûth </span>(shadow, darkness), the general signification being all that is required in any one of the fifteen places where it occurs. It is true it is used of the “grave” or “underworld” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/10-21.htm" title="Before I go from where I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;">Job 10:21-22</a>). But it is also used of the “darkness of a dungeon” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-10.htm" title="Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;">Psalm 107:10</a>), of “the pathless desert” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm" title="Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelled?">Jeremiah 2:6</a>); or, possibly, since it is there parallel with <span class= "ital">drought, </span>of “the blinding darkness of a sandstorm,” and metaphorically of “affliction” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm" title="The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, on them has the light shined.">Isaiah 9:2</a>), and of the “dull heavy look” that grief wears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm" title="My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;">Job 16:16</a>).<p>By <span class= "ital">valley </span>we must understand a deep ravine. Palestine abounds in wild and gloomy valleys, and shepherd life experiences the actual peril of them. Addison’s paraphrase catches the true feeling of the original—<p>“Though in the path of death I tread,<p>With gloomy horrors overhead.”<p><span class= "bld">Thy rod and thy staff.</span>—Used both for <span class= "ital">guiding </span>and <span class= "ital">defending </span>the flock.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm" title="Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me.">Psalm 23:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death — </span>Through a dark and dismal valley, full of terrors and dangers, as this phrase signifies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-17.htm" title="For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.">Job 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-19.htm" title="Though you have sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.">Psalm 44:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm" title="Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelled?">Jeremiah 2:6</a>; that is, though I am in peril of death, though in the midst of dangers, deep as a valley, dark as a shadow, and dreadful as death itself: or rather, though I am under the arrests of death, and have received the sentence of death within myself, and have every reason to look upon myself as a dying man: <span class="ital">I will fear no evil</span> — I will not give way to my fears, but will confidently rely upon the word and promise of God, persuaded that his grace shall be sufficient for me, and that he will make even death itself work for my good. Observe, reader, a child of God may meet the messengers of death, and receive its summons, with a holy security and serenity of mind. He may bid it defiance, and say with Paul, <span class="ital">O death where is thy sting? For thou art with me </span>— Here is the ground of a true Christian’s confidence when <span class="ital">in the valley of the shadow of death, God is with him, </span>and his presence inspires him with confidence and comfort, hope and joy. It affords him light amidst the <span class="ital">darkness </span>of the valley, and life in the <span class="ital">death </span>of it. <span class="ital">Thy rod and thy staff — </span>Thy word and thy Spirit; <span class="ital">comfort me — </span>His gospel is <span class="ital">the rod of his strength, </span>and there is enough in that to comfort the saints, both while they live, even in their greatest troubles, and also when they are dying. And his Spirit is the Comforter himself, and where he is, support and comfort cannot be wanting. His rod of chastisement and correction also ministers to the comfort of his people, and much more his staff of support, his upholding grace, which, under all their trials, and even in their last and greatest trial, is sufficient for them. Or the rod may signify his pastoral care, and inspection of the flock, (alluding to the shepherd’s crook, or rod, under which the sheep passed when they were counted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-32.htm" title="And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:32</a>,) and the staff, the defence, and protection afforded them, the shepherd with his staff being wont to defend his sheep from the dogs and wolves that would worry them. Or, as others interpret the words, <span class="ital">the rod </span>here, in allusion to the rod of Moses, may be considered as an emblem of power, especially as the word <span class="greekheb">שׁבשׂ</span>, <span class="ital">shebet, </span>here translated <span class="ital">rod, </span>often signifies a <span class="ital">sceptre, </span>or some other ensign of authority. And the word translated <span class="ital">staff, </span><span class="greekheb">משׁענה</span>, <span class="ital">mishgneneh, </span>properly signifies what a person leans upon for support. Thus interpreted, the clause means, The sceptre of thy kingdom, or thy power protects me, and thy support upholds me, and so both minister to my comfort.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-6 Confidence in God's grace and care. - "The Lord is my shepherd." In these words, the believer is taught to express his satisfaction in the care of the great Pastor of the universe, the Redeemer and Preserver of men. With joy he reflects that he has a shepherd, and that shepherd is Jehovah. A flock of sheep, gentle and harmless, feeding in verdant pastures, under the care of a skilful, watchful, and tender shepherd, forms an emblem of believers brought back to the Shepherd of their souls. The greatest abundance is but a dry pasture to a wicked man, who relishes in it only what pleases the senses; but to a godly man, who by faith tastes the goodness of God in all his enjoyments, though he has but little of the world, it is a green pasture. The Lord gives quiet and contentment in the mind, whatever the lot is. Are we blessed with the green pastures of the ordinances, let us not think it enough to pass through them, but let us abide in them. The consolations of the Holy Spirit are the still waters by which the saints are led; the streams which flow from the Fountain of living waters. Those only are led by the still waters of comfort, who walk in the paths of righteousness. The way of duty is the truly pleasant way. The work of righteousness in peace. In these paths we cannot walk, unless. God lead us into them, and lead us on in them. Discontent and distrust proceed from unbelief; an unsteady walk is the consequence: let us then simply trust our Shepherd's care, and hearken to his voice. The valley of the shadow of death may denote the most severe and terrible affliction, or dark dispensation of providence, that the psalmist ever could come under. Between the part of the flock on earth and that which is gone to heaven, death lies like a dark valley that must be passed in going from one to the other. But even in this there are words which lessen the terror. It is but the shadow of death: the shadow of a serpent will not sting, nor the shadow of a sword kill. It is a valley, deep indeed, and dark, and miry; but valleys are often fruitful, and so is death itself fruitful of comforts to God's people. It is a walk through it: they shall not be lost in this valley, but get safe to the mountain on the other side. Death is a king of terrors, but not to the sheep of Christ. When they come to die, God will rebuke the enemy; he will guide them with his rod, and sustain them with his staff. There is enough in the gospel to comfort the saints when dying, and underneath them are the everlasting arms. The Lord's people feast at his table, upon the provisions of his love. Satan and wicked men are not able to destroy their comforts, while they are anointed with the Holy Spirit, and drink of the cup of salvation which is ever full. Past experience teaches believers to trust that the goodness and mercy of God will follow them all the days of their lives, and it is their desire and determination, to seek their happiness in the service of God here, and they hope to enjoy his love for ever in heaven. While here, the Lord can make any situation pleasant, by the anointing of his Spirit and the joys of his salvation. But those that would be satisfied with the blessings of his house, must keep close to the duties of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death - The meaning of this in the connection in which it occurs is this: "God will lead and guide me in the path of righteousness, even though that path lies through the darkest and most gloomy vale - through deep and dismal shades - in regions where there is no light, as if death had cast his dark and baleful shadow there. It is still a right path; it is a path of safety; and it will conduct me to bright regions beyond. In that dark and gloomy valley, though I could not guide myself, I will not be alarmed; I will not be afraid of wandering or of being lost; I will not fear any enemies there - for my Shepherd is there to guide me still." On the word here rendered "shadow of death" - &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;  tsalma&#770;veth - see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-5.htm">Job 3:5</a>, note; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, note. The word occurs besides only in the following places, in all of which it is rendered "shadow of death:" <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-22.htm">Job 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm">Job 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-17.htm">Job 24:17</a> (twice); <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-3.htm">Job 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-22.htm">Job 34:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-19.htm">Psalm 44:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-14.htm">Psalm 107:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>. The idea is that of death casting his gloomy shadow over that valley - the valley of the dead. Hence, the word is applicable to any path of gloom or sadness; any scene of trouble or sorrow; any dark and dangerous way. Thus understood, it is applicable not merely to death itself - though it embraces that - but to any or all the dark, the dangerous, and the gloomy paths which we tread in life: to ways of sadness, solitude, and sorrow. All along those paths God will be a safe and certain guide.<p>I will fear no evil - Dark, cheerless, dismal as it seems, I will dread nothing. The true friend of God has nothing to fear in that dark valley. His great Shepherd will accompany him there, and can lead him safely through, however dark it may appear. The true believer has nothing to fear in the most gloomy scenes of life; he has nothing to fear in the valley of death; he has nothing to fear in the grave; he has nothing to fear in the world beyond.<p>For thou art with me - Thou wilt be with me. Though invisible, thou wilt attend me. I shall not go alone; I shall not be alone. The psalmist felt assured that if God was with him he had nothing to dread there. God would be his companion, his comforter, his protector, his guide. How applicable is this to death! The dying man seems to go into the dark valley alone. His friends accompany him as far as they can, and then they must give him the parting hand. They cheer him with their voice until he becomes deaf to all sounds; they cheer him with their looks until his eye becomes dim, and he can see no more; they cheer him with the fond embrace until he becomes insensible to every expression of earthly affection, and then he seems to be alone. But the dying believer is not alone. His Saviour God is with him in that valley, and will never leave him. Upon His arm he can lean, and by His presence he will be comforted, until he emerges from the gloom into the bright world beyond. All that is needful to dissipate the terrors of the valley of death is to be able to say, "Thou art with me."<p>Thy rod and thy staff - It may not be easy to mark the difference between these two words; but they would seem probably to refer, the latter to the "staff" which the shepherd used in walking, and the former to the "crook" which a shepherd used for guiding his flock. The image is that of a shepherd in attendance on his flock, with a staff on which he leans with one hand; in the other hand the "crook" or rod which was the symbol of his office. Either of these also might be used to guard the flock, or to drive off the enemies of the flock. The "crook" is said (see Rosenmuller, in loc.) to have been used to seize the legs of the sheep or goats when they were disposed to run away, and thus to keep them with the flock. "The shepherd invariably carries a rod or staff with him when he goes forth to feed his flock. It is often bent or hooked at one end, which gave rise to the shepherd's crook in the hand of the Christian bishop. With this staff he rules and guides the flock to their green pastures, and defends them from their enemies. With it also he corrects them when disobedient, and brings them back when wandering." (The land and the book, vol. i., p. 305.)<p>They comfort me - The sight of them consoles me. They show that the Shepherd is there. As significant of his presence and his office, they impart confidence, showing that he will not leave me alone, and that he will defend me. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

Which designs not a state of spiritual darkness and ignorance, as sitting in the shadow of death sometimes does, since the psalmist cannot be supposed to be at this time or after in such a condition; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; nor desertion or the hidings of God's face, which is sometimes the case of the people of God, and was the case of the psalmist at times; but now he expressly says the Lord was with him; but rather, since the grave is called the land of the shadow of death, and the distresses persons are usually in, under apprehensions of immediate death, are called the terrors of the shadow of death; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>; the case supposed is, that should his soul draw nigh to the grave, and the sorrows of death compass him about, and he should be upon the brink and borders of eternity, he should be fearless of evil, and sing, "O death! where is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory?" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>, though it seems best of all to interpret it of the most severe and terrible affliction or dark dispensation of Providence it could be thought he should ever come under, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-19.htm">Psalm 44:19</a>. The Targum interprets it of captivity, and Jarchi and Kimchi of the wilderness of Ziph, in which David was when pursued by Saul; and the latter also, together with Ben Melech, of the grave, and of a place of danger and of distress, which is like unto the grave, that is, a place of darkness; and Aben Ezra of some grievous calamity, which God had decreed to bring into the world. Suidas (w) interprets this phrase of danger leading to death; afflictions attend the people of God in this life; there is a continued series of them, so that they may be said to walk in them; these are the way in which they walk heaven, and through which they enter the kingdom; for though they continue long, and one affliction comes after another, yet there will be an end at last; they will walk and wade through them, and come out of great tribulations; and in the midst of such dark dispensations, comparable to a dark and gloomy valley, covered with the shadow of death, the psalmist intimates what would be the inward disposition of his mind, and what his conduct and behaviour: <p>I will fear no evil; neither the evil one Satan, who is the wolf that comes to the flock to kill and to destroy, and the roaring lion that seeks whom he may devour, since the Lord was his shepherd, and on his side: nor evil men, who kill the body and can do no more, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; nor any evil thing, the worst calamity that could befall him, since everything of this kind is determined by God, and comes not without his knowledge and will, and works for good, and cannot separate from the love of Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>; <p>for thou art with me; sheep are timorous creatures, and so are Christ's people; but when he the shepherd is them, to sympathize with them under all their afflictions, to revive and comfort them with the cordials of his love and promises of his grace, to bear them up and support them with his mighty arm of power, to teach and instruct them by every providence, and sanctify all unto them; their fears are driven away, and they pass through the dark valley, the deep waters, and fiery trials, with courage and cheerfulness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>; <p>thy rod and thy staff they comfort me; not the rod of afflictions and chastisements, which is the sense of some Jewish (x) as well as Christian interpreters; though these are in love, and the saints have often much consolation under them; but these are designed by the valley of the shadow of death, and cannot have a place here, but rather the rod of the word, called the rod of Christ's strength, and the staff of the promises and the provisions of God's house, the whole staff and stay of bread and water, which are sure unto the saints, and refresh and comfort them. The Targum interprets the rod and staff of the word and law of God; and those interpreters who explain the rod of afflictions, yet by the staff understand the law; and Jarchi expounds it, of the mercy of God in the remission of sin, in which the psalmist trusted: the allusion is to the shepherd's crook or staff, as in other places; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; which was made use of for the telling and numbering of the sheep, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-32.htm">Leviticus 27:32</a>; and it is no small comfort to the sheep of Christ that they have passed under his rod, who has told them, and that they are all numbered by him; not only their persons, but the very hairs of their head; and that they are under his care and protection: the shepherd with his rod, staff, or crook, directs the sheep where to go, pushes forward those that are behind, and fetches back those that go astray; as well as drives away dogs, wolves, bears, &amp;c. that would make a prey of the flock; and of such use is the word of God, attended with the power of Christ and his Spirit; it points out the path of faith, truth, and holiness, the saints should walk in; it urges and stirs up those that are negligent to the discharge of their duty, and is the means of reclaiming backsliders, and of preserving the flock from the ravenous wolves of false teachers: in a word, the presence, power, and protection of Christ, in and by is Gospel and ordinances, are what are here intended, and which are the comfort and safety of his people, in the worst of times and cases. <p>(w) In voce  (x) Shirhashirim Rabba, fol. 9. 2.

The figure of the shepherd is still continued. “The sheep districts [in Palestine] consist of wide open wolds or downs, reft here and there by deep ravines, in whose sides lurks many a wild beast, the enemy of the flocks” (Tristram, <span class="ital">Nat. Hist</span>. p. 138). Even in such a dismal glen, where unknown perils are thickest, where deathly gloom and horror are on every side, he knows no fear. Cp. Jeremiah’s description of Jehovah’s care for Israel in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>).

It is not improbable that the pronunciation of the word was altered at an early date in accordance with a popular etymology (like our <span class="ital">causeway</span>, originally <span class="ital">causey</span>, from Fr. <span class="ital">chaussée</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for thou</span> art <span class="ital">with me</span>] God’s presence is His people’s strength and comfort.

At the close of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, where the form of the ritual thank-offering is straightway ignored, &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>) takes the place of the &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;. There it is the view of one who is rescued and who thankfully glorifies God, which leads to others sharing with him in the enjoyment of the salvation he has experienced; here it is an actual enjoyment of it, the joy, springing from thankfulness, manifesting itself not merely in words but in a thank-offering feast, at which, in Israel, those who long for salvation are the invited guests, for with them it is an acknowledgment of the mighty act of a God whom they already know; but among the heathen, men of the most diversified conditions, the richest and the poorest, for to them it is a favour unexpectedly brought to them, and which is all the more gratefully embraced by them on that account. So magnificent shall be the feast, that all &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, i.e., those who stand out prominently before the world and before their own countrymen by reason of the abundance of their temporal possessions (compare on the ascensive use of &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-9.htm">Isaiah 23:9</a>), choose it before this abundance, in which they might revel, and, on account of the grace and glory which the celebration includes within itself, they bow down and worship. In antithesis to the "fat ones of the earth" stand those who go down to the dust (&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, always used in this formula of the dust of the grave, like the Arabic tura&#770;b) by reason of poverty and care. In the place of the participle &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; we now have with &#1493;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; ( equals  &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;) a clause with &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, which has the value of a relative clause (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-21.htm">Psalm 49:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-39.htm">Psalm 78:39</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-13.htm">Proverbs 9:13</a>, and frequently): and they who have not heretofore prolonged and could not prolong their life (Ges. 123, 3, c). By comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a> Hupfeld understands it to be those who are actually dead; so that it would mean, His kingdom extends to the living and the dead, to this world and the nether world. But any idea of a thankful adoration of God on the part of the dwellers in Hades is alien to the Old Testament; and there is nothing to force us to it here, since &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491; &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, can just as well mean descensuri as qui descenderunt, and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; dna ,tnuredne &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>) means to preserve his own life, - a phrase which can be used in the sense of vitam sustentare and of conservare with equal propriety. It is, therefore, those who are almost dead already with care and want, these also (and how thankfully do these very ones) go down upon their knees, because they are accounted worthy to be guests at this table. It is the same great feast, of which Isaiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, prophesies, and which he there accompanies with the music of his words. And the result of this evangel of the mighty act of rescue is not only of boundless universality, but also of unlimited duration: it propagates itself from one generation to another.<p>Formerly we interpreted <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-31.htm">Psalm 22:31</a> "a seed, which shall serve Him, shall be reckoned to the Lord for a generation;" taking &#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; as a metaphor applying to the census, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a>, and &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a> and other passages, as used of a totality of one kind, as &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; of the whole body of those of the same race. But the connection makes it more natural to take &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; in a genealogical sense; and, moreover, with the former interpretation it ought to have been &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; instead of &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;. We must therefore retain the customary interpretation: "a seed (posterity) shall serve Him, it shall be told concerning the Lord to the generation (to come)." Decisive in favour of this interpretation is &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; with the following &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, by which &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; acquires the meaning of the future generation, exactly as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-18.htm">Psalm 71:18</a>, inasmuch as it at once becomes clear, that three generations are distinctly mentioned, viz., that of the fathers who turn unto Jahve, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>, that of the coming &#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-31.htm">Psalm 22:31</a>, and &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;, to whom the news of the salvation is propagated by this &#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-31.htm">Psalm 22:31</a> : "They shall come (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-18.htm">Psalm 71:18</a> : to come into being), and shall declare His righteousness to the people that shall be born, that He hath finished." Accordingly &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; is the principal notion, which divides itself into (&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;) &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; and &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;; from which it is at once clear, why the expression could be thus general, "a posterity," inasmuch as it is defined by what follows. &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; is the people which shall be born, or whose birth is near at hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-6.htm">Psalm 78:6</a>); the lxx well renders it: &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-19.htm">Psalm 102:19</a> &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488; populus creandus). &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1514;&#1493; is the dikaiosu'nee of God, which has become manifest in the rescue of the great sufferer. That He did not suffer him to come down to the very border of death without snatching him out of the way of his murderous foes and raising him to a still greater glory, this was divine &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;. That He did not snatch him out of the way of his murderous foes without suffering him to be on the point of death - even this wrathful phase of the divine &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, is indicated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, but then only very remotely. For the fact, that the Servant of God, before spreading the feast accompanying the shelamim (thank-offering) in which He makes the whole world participants in the fruit of His suffering, offered Himself as an asham (sin-offering), does not become a subject of prophetic revelation until later on, and then under other typical relationships. The nature of the &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, which is in accordance with the determinate counsel of God, is only gradually disclosed in the Old Testament. This one word, so full of meaning (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-11.htm">Psalm 52:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>), implying the carrying through of the work of redemption, which is prefigured in David, comprehends everything within itself. It may be compared to the &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>, at the close of the history of the creation. It is the last word of the Psalm, just as &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is the last word of the Crucified One. The substance of the gospel in its preparatory history and its fulfilment, of the declaration concerning God which passes from generation to generation, is this, that God has accomplished what He planned when He anointed the son of Jesse and the Son of David as mediator in His work of redemption; that He accomplished it by leading the former through affliction to the throne, and making the cross to the latter a ladder leading up to heaven. </body></html>
