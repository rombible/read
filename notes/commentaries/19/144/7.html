Happy those to whom the Lord gives that noblest victory, conquest and dominion over their own spirits. A prayer for further mercy is fitly begun with a thanksgiving for former mercy. There was a special power of God, inclining the people of Israel to be subject to David; it was typical of the bringing souls into subjection to the Lord Jesus. Man's days have little substance, considering how many thoughts and cares of a never-dying soul are employed about a poor dying body. Man's life is as a shadow that passes away. In their highest earthly exaltation, believers will recollect how mean, sinful, and vile they are in themselves; thus they will be preserved from self-importance and presumption. God's time to help his people is, when they are sinking, and all other helps fail.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/144.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Send thine hand from above - Margin, as in Hebrew, "hands."

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-3.htm">Psalm 54:3</a> : "For strangers are risen up against me."

David's praise of God as his all-sufficient help is enhanced by a recognition of the intrinsic worthlessness of man.

It may be applied to the sorrows and sufferings of Christ, the antitype of David, with which he was overwhelmed; to the billows of divine wrath which went over him; to the floods of ungodly men that encompassed him; and to the whole posse of devils, Satan, and his principalities and powers, that attacked him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>; <p>from the hand of strange children; which explains what is meant by "great waters": wicked men chiefly; either Gentiles, the children of a people of a strange nation, and of a strange language, and of strange sentiments of religion, and that worship a strange god: such as the Edomites, Moabites, Philistines, &amp;c. who were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise: or else the Israelites, who were degenerated from their ancestors, such of David's subjects that rebelled against him; so the Ziphims are called strangers that rose up against him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-3.htm">Psalm 54:3</a>; and such were the enemies of Christ, both the Romans, who were Heathens and aliens; and the people of the Jews, his own countrymen, who were a generation of vipers; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>; such as Juvenal calls (l) "filii morum", who inherited the vices of their fathers. <p>(l) Satyr. 14. v. 52. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/144.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> waters, from the hand of strange children;</span><p>(f) That is, deliver me from the tumults of they who should be my people but are corrupt in their judgment and enterprises, as though they were strangers.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/144.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

Hence the calling of Jahve "my rock," <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-47.htm">Psalm 18:47</a>; hence the heaping up of other appellations in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>, in which <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a> is echoed; but &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1497; (with Lamed deprived of the Dagesh) follows the model of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2</a>. The naming of Jahve with &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; is a bold abbreviation of &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a>, 18, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a> the God whom the idolatrous ones forsake is called &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;. Instead of &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; the Davidic Psalms also poetically say &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-9.htm">Psalm 78:9</a>. The expression "who traineth my hands for the fight" we have already read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>. The last words of the strophe, too, are after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a>; but instead of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; this poet says &#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;, from &#1512;&#1491;&#1491;  equals  &#1512;&#1491;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>), perhaps under the influence of uwmoriyd in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-48.htm">2 Samuel 22:48</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a> we however read &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, and the Masora has enumerated <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>, together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, as the three passages in which it is written &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;, whilst one expects &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1490; &#1491;&#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), as the Targum, Syriac, and Jerome (yet not the lxx) in fact render it. But neither from the language of the books nor from the popular dialect can it be reasonably expected that they would say &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; for &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in such an ambiguous connection. Either, therefore, we have to read &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;,<p>(Note: Rashi is acquainted with an otherwise unknown note of the Masora: &#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;; but this Ker is imaginary.)<p>or we must fall in with the strong expression, and this is possible: there is, indeed, no necessity for the subduing to be intended of the use of despotic power, it can also be intended to God-given power, and of subjugating authority. David, the anointed one, but not having as yet ascended the throne, here gives expression to the hope that Jahve will grant him deeds of victory which will compel Israel to submit to him, whether willingly or reluctantly. </body></html>
