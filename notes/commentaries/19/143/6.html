David, before he prays for the removal of his trouble, prays for the pardon of his sin, and depends upon mercy alone for it. He bemoans the weight upon his mind from outward troubles. But he looks back, and remembers God's former appearance for his afflicted people, and for him in particular. He looks round, and notices the works of God. The more we consider the power of God, the less we shall fear the face or force of man. He looks up with earnest desires towards God and his favour. This is the best course we can take, when our spirits are overwhelmed. The believer will not forget, that in his best actions he is a sinner. Meditation and prayer will recover us from distresses; and then the mourning soul strives to return to the Lord as the infant stretches out its hands to the indulgent mother, and thirsts for his consolations as the parched ground for refreshing rain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/143.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I stretch forth my hands unto thee - In prayer.

The word rendered "thirsty" here means properly "weary." The idea is that of a land which seems to be weary; which has no vigor of growth; and where everything seems to be exhausted.

As a dry land, which wants water, gapes, and as it were thirsts for rain, which is very refreshing to it; so his soul thirsted after God, after his word and ordinances, after communion with him in them, after his grace and fresh supplies of it; particularly after pardoning grace and mercy, after the coming of Christ, and the blessings of grace by him; as reconciliation, atonement, righteousness, and salvation; after more knowledge of God and Christ, and divine truths; and after the enjoyment of them in heaven to all eternity.

The "pause-mark," "selah," at the end of the verse, at once gives time for secret prayer, and makes a division of the psalm into two parts. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/142.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>His request now ascends all the more confident of being answered, and becomes calm, being well-grounded in his feebleness and the superiority of his enemies, and aiming at the glorifying of the divine Name. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-7.htm">Psalm 142:7</a> &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; calls to mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1</a>; the first confirmation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>, and the second, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-18.htm">Psalm 18:18</a>. But this is the only passage in the whole Psalter where the poet designates the "distress" in which he finds himself as a prison (&#1502;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;). V. 8b brings the whole congregation of the righteous in in the praising of the divine Name. The poet therefore does not after all find himself so absolutely alone, as it might seem according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>. He is far from regarding himself as the only righteous person. He is only a member of a community or church whose destiny is interwoven with his own, and which will glory in his deliverance as its own; for "if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>). We understand the differently interpreted &#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; after this "rejoicing with" (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;). The lxx, Syriac, and Aquilaz render: the righteous wait for me; but to wait is &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; and not &#1492;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;. The modern versions, on the other hand, almost universally, like Luther after Felix Pratensis, render: the righteous shall surround me (flock about me), in connection with which, as Hengstenberg observes, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; denotes the tender sympathy they fell with him: crowding closely upon me. But there is no instance of a verb of surrounding (&#1488;&#1508;&#1507;, &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;, &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507;) taking &#1489;&#1468;; the accusative stands with &#1492;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-4.htm">Habakkuk 1:4</a>, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>, in the signification cingere. Symmachus (although erroneously rendering: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), Jerome (in me coronabuntur justi), Parchon, Aben-Ezra, Coccejus, and others, rightly take &#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; as a denominative from &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, to put on a crown or to crown (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-18.htm">Proverbs 14:18</a>): on account of me the righteous shall adorn themselves as with crowns, i.e., shall triumph, that Thou dealest bountifully with me (an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-6.htm">Psalm 13:6</a>). According to passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-11.htm">Psalm 64:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-17.htm">Psalm 40:17</a>, one might have expected &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;. But the close of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>.), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-12.htm">Psalm 140:12</a>., shows that &#1489;&#1497; is also admissible. The very fact that David contemplates his own destiny and the destiny of his foes in a not merely ideal but foreordainedly causal connection with the general end of the two powers that stand opposed to one another in the world, belongs to the characteristic impress of the Psalms of David that come from the time of Saul's persecution. </body></html>
