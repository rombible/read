The success with which God blessed David, was a type of the total overthrow of all Christ's enemies. Those who might have had Christ to rule and save them, but rejected him and fought against him, shall find the remembrance of it a worm that dies not. God makes sinners willing by his grace, receives them to his favour, and delivers them from the wrath to come. May he exalt himself, by his all-powerful grace, in our hearts, destroying all the strong-holds of sin and Satan. How great should be our joy and praise to behold our Brother and Friend upon the throne, and for all the blessings we may expect from him! yet he delights in his exalted state, as enabling him to confer happiness and glory on poor sinners, who are taught to love and trust in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their fruit - Their offspring; their children; their posterity, for so the parallelism demands. The "fruit" is that which the tree produces; and hence, the word comes to be applied to children as the production of the parent. See this use of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-2.htm">Genesis 30:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-22.htm">Exodus 21:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-18.htm">Deuteronomy 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>.<p>Shalt thou destroy from the earth - Thou shalt utterly destroy them. This is in accordance with the statement so often made in the Scriptures, and with what so often occurs in fact, that the consequences of the sins of parents pass over to their posterity, and that they suffer in consequence of those sins. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-5.htm">Leviticus 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>; compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-21</a>.<p>And their seed - Their posterity.<p>From among the children of men - From among men, or the human family. That is, they would be entirely cut off from the earth. The truth taught here is, that the wicked will ultimately be destroyed, and that God will obtain a complete triumph over them, or that the kingdom of righteousness shall be at length completely established. A time will come when truth and justice shall be triumphant, when all the wicked shall be removed out of the way; when all that oppose God and his cause shall be destroyed, and when God shall show, by thus removing and punishing the wicked, that he is the Friend of all that is true, and good, and right. The "idea" of the psalmist probably was that this would yet occur on the earth; the "language" is such, also, as may be applied to that ultimate state, in the future world, when all the wicked shall be destroyed, and the righteous shall be no more troubled with them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. fruit&#8212;children (Ps 37:25; Ho 9:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their fruit; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The verb &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, because used of the favour which meets and presents one with some blessing, is construed with a double accusative, after the manner of verbs of putting on and bestowing (Ges. &#1431;139). Since <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a> cannot be intended to refer to David's first coronation, but to the preservation and increase of the honour of his kingship, this particularisation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a> sounds like a prediction of what is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-30.htm">2 Samuel 22:30</a> : after the conquest of the Ammonitish royal city Rabbah David set the Ammonitish crown (&#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514;), which is renowned for the weight of its gold and its ornamentation with precious stones, upon his head. David was then advanced in years, and in consequence of heavy guilt, which, however, he had overcome by penitence and laying hold on the mercy of God, was come to the brink of the grave. He, worthy of death, still lived; and the victory over the Syro-Ammonitish power was a pledge to him of God's faithfulness in fulfilling his promises. It is contrary to the tenour of the words to say that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-5.htm">Psalm 21:5</a> does not refer to length of life, but to hereditary succession to the throne. To wish any one that he may live &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, and especially a king, is a usual thing, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-31.htm">1 Kings 1:31</a>, and frequently. The meaning is, may the life of the king be prolonged to an indefinitely distant day. What the people have desired elsewhere, they here acknowledge as bestowed upon the king. </body></html>
