The word “prevent” is familiar in this sense in the English collect: “Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm" title="O remember not against us former iniquities: let your tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.">Psalm 79:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>.) The “crown “is by some identified with that won by David at Rabbah Moab. Others make it refer to a coronation. Ewald thinks of a birthday celebration. Probably no more is intended than a symbol of victory and rejoicing. Maidens were accustomed to meet a monarch returning in victory, and to offer a <span class= "ital">crown, </span>or <span class= "ital">garland, </span>which was a symbol of extraordinary rejoicing. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-11.htm" title="The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.">Psalm 68:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-11.htm" title="Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.">Song of Solomon 3:11</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-8.htm" title="Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:">Wisdom Of Solomon 2:8</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/15-13.htm" title="And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid that was with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armour with garlands, and with songs in their mouths.">Judith 15:13</a>; 3Ma 7:16.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm" title="For you prevent him with the blessings of goodness: you set a crown of pure gold on his head.">Psalm 21:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou preventest him — </span>Or, <span class="ital">didst prevent him, </span>namely, David; crowning him with manifold blessings, both more and sooner than he desired or expected, surprising him with the gift of the kingdom, and with many happy successes. <span class="ital">With the blessings of goodness — </span>That is, with excellent <span class="ital">blessings, </span>or <span class="ital">with abundance of good. </span>Applying this to Christ, we must say, The Son of God could not be more ready to ask for the blessings of the divine goodness than the Father was to give them, and his disposition is the same toward all his adopted sons. By the <span class="ital">crown of pure gold, </span>may be meant, in general, an illustrious crown, which is here represented as being set upon our Lord’s head at his exaltation into heaven, in token of his being then advanced to this chief exercise of his regal authority. Thus he is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-5.htm" title="For you have made him a little lower than the angels, and have crowned him with glory and honor.">Psalm 8:5</a>, to be <span class="ital">crowned with glory and honour; </span>and St. John says, with respect to his deified humanity, in which he was made King of kings, and Lord of lords, that <span class="ital">on his head were many crowns, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm" title="And he has on his clothing and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.">Revelation 19:16</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-6 Happy the people whose king makes God's strength his confidence, and God's salvation his joy; who is pleased with all the advancements of God kingdom, and trusts God to support him in all he does for the service of it. All our blessings are blessings of goodness, and are owing, not to any merit of ours, but only to God's goodness. But when God's blessings come sooner, and prove richer than we imagine; when they are given before we prayed for them, before we were ready for them, nay, when we feared the contrary; then it may be truly said that he prevented, or went before us, with them. Nothing indeed prevented, or went before Christ, but to mankind never was any favour more preventing than our redemption by Christ. Thou hast made him to be a universal, everlasting blessing to the world, in whom the families of the earth are, and shall be blessed; and so thou hast made him exceeding glad with the countenance thou hast given to his undertaking, and to him in the prosecution of it. The Spirit of prophecy rises from what related to the king, to that which is peculiar to Christ; none other is blessed for ever, much less a blessing for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou preventest him - Thou goest before him; thou dost anticipate him. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>, margin. Our word "prevent" is now most commonly used in the sense of "hinder, stop, or intercept." This is not the original meaning of the English word; and the word is never used in this sense in the Bible. The English word, when our translation was made, meant to "go before," to "anticipate," and this is the uniform meaning of it in our English version, as it is the meaning of the original. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-12.htm">Job 3:12</a>.

The meaning here is, that God had "anticipated" him, or his desires. He had gone before him. He had designed the blessing even before it was asked.<p>With the blessings of goodness - Blessings "indicating" goodness on his part; blessings adapted to promote the "good" or the welfare of him on whom they were bestowed. Perhaps the meaning here is, not only that they were "good," but they "seemed" to be good; they were not "blessings in disguise," or blessings as the result of previous calamity and trial, but blessings where there was no trial - no shadow - no appearance of disappointment.<p>Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head - This does not refer to the time of his coronation, or the period when he was crowned a king, but it refers to the victory which he had achieved, and by which he had been made truly a king. He was crowned with triumph; he was shown to be a king; the victory was like making him a king, or setting a crown of pure gold upon his head. He was now a conqueror, and was indeed a king. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. preventest&#8212;literally, "to meet here in good sense," or "friendship" (Ps 59:10; compare opposite, Ps 17:13).<p>blessings of goodness&#8212;which confer happiness.<p>crown of pure gold&#8212;a figure for the highest royal prosperity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Preventest him; </span> or, <span class="ital">didst prevent him</span>; crowning him with manifold blessings, both more and sooner than he either desired or expected; surprising him with the gift of the kingdom, and with many happy successes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With the blessing of goodness, </span> i. e. with excellent blessings.

Not temporal, but spiritual blessings, which spring from the grace and goodness of God, and consist of it; and relate to the spiritual and eternal welfare of those for whose sake he receives them, and who are blessed with them in him: his being "prevented" with them denotes the freeness of the donation of them; that before he could well ask for them, or before he had done requesting them, they were given him; and also the earliness of the gift of them, they were put into his hands before his incarnation, before he was manifest in the flesh, even from the foundation of the world, and before the world began, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>, and likewise the order in which they were given; first to Christ, and then to his people in him, as the passages referred to show; <p>thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head; which is expressive of his victory over all enemies, sin, Satan, and the world, death and hell; and of his being possessed of his throne and kingdom; and has respect to his exaltation at the right hand of God, where he is crowned with glory and honour: and this crown being of "pure gold" denotes the purity, glory, solidity, and perpetuity of his kingdom; this is a crown, not which believers put upon him by believing in him, and ascribing the glory of their salvation to him, or what the church, called his mother, has crowned him with, Sol 3:11, but which his father put upon him, who has set him King over his holy hill of Zion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>; compare with this <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>. The Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions read "a crown of a precious stone"; and so Apollinarius; and seem to refer to the crown set on David's head, which had precious stones in it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>; Josephus (x) says it had a sardonyx.

As Hengstenberg observes, "The setting on of the crown marks the bestowment of dominion," not in one petty ease only, but generally, and is scarcely to be altogether separated from the promises recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 20:7-9) While <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-2.htm">Psalm 20:2</a> were being sung the offering of the sacrifice was probably going on. Now, after a lengthened pause, there ascends a voice, probably the voice of one of the Levites, expressing the cheering assurance of the gracious acceptance of the offering that has been presented by the priest. With &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; or &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, the usual word to indicate the turning-point, the instantaneous entrance of the result of some previous process of prolonged duration, whether hidden or manifest (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-24.htm">1 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>), is introduced. howshiya` is the perfect of faith, which, in the certainty of being answered, realises the fulfilment in anticipation. The exuberance of the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> corresponds to the exuberance of feeling which thus finds expression.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> the answer is expected out of Zion, in the present instance it is looked for from God's holy heavens; for the God who sits enthroned in Zion is enthroned for ever in the heavens. His throne on earth is as it were the vestibule of His heavenly throne; His presence in the sanctuary of Israel is no limitation of His omnipresence; His help out of Zion is the help of the Celestial One and Him who is exalted above the heaven of heavens. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; does not here mean the fulness of might (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>), but the displays of power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-2.htm">Psalm 106:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-2.htm">Psalm 150:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1-11</a> :15), by which His right hand procures salvation, i.e., victory, for the combatant. The glory of Israel is totally different from that of the heathen, which manifests itself in boastful talk. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a> &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1497;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; must be supplied from the &#1504;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a> (lxx &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;  equals  &#1504;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>); &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;, to make laudatory mention of any matter, to extol, and indirectly therefore to take credit to one's self for it, to boast of it (cf. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a>). According to the Law Israel was forbidden to have any standing army; and the law touching the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>) speaks strongly against his keeping many horses. It was also the same under the judges, and at this time under David; but under Solomon, who acquired for himself horses and chariots in great number (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>), it was very different. It is therefore a confession that must belong to the time of David which is here made in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a>, viz., that Israel's glory in opposition to their enemies, especially the Syrians, is the sure defence and protection of the Name of their God alone. The language of David to Goliath is very similar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>. The preterites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-9.htm">Psalm 20:9</a> are praet. confidentiae. It is, as Luther says, "a song of triumph before the victory, a shout of joy before succour." Since &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; does not mean to stand, but to rise, &#1511;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; assumes the present superiority of the enemy. But the position of affairs changes: those who stand fall, and those who are lying down rise up; the former remain lying, the latter keep the field. The Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491; signifies to show one's self firm, strong, courageous; like &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/147-6.htm">Psalm 147:6</a>, to strengthen, confirm, recover, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; to be compact, firm, cogn.
