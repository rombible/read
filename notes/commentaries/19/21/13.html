The success with which God blessed David, was a type of the total overthrow of all Christ's enemies. Those who might have had Christ to rule and save them, but rejected him and fought against him, shall find the remembrance of it a worm that dies not. God makes sinners willing by his grace, receives them to his favour, and delivers them from the wrath to come. May he exalt himself, by his all-powerful grace, in our hearts, destroying all the strong-holds of sin and Satan. How great should be our joy and praise to behold our Brother and Friend upon the throne, and for all the blessings we may expect from him! yet he delights in his exalted state, as enabling him to confer happiness and glory on poor sinners, who are taught to love and trust in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength - This is the concluding part of the psalm (see the introduction), expressing a desire that God "might" be exalted over all his foes; or that his own strength might he so manifestly put forth that he would be exalted as he ought to be. This is the ultimate and chief desire of all holy created beings, that God might be exalted in the estimation of the universe above all other beings - or that he might so triumph over all his enemies as to reign supreme.<p>So will we sing and praise thy power - That is, as the result of thy being thus exalted to proper honor, we will unite in celebrating thy glory and thy power. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/7-10.htm">Revelation 7:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1-3</a>. This will be the result of all the triumphs which God will achieve in the world, that the holy beings of all worlds will gather around his throne and "sing and praise his power." The "thought" in the psalm is that God will ultimately triumph over all his foes, and that this triumph will be followed by universal rejoicing and praise.

The psalm, as already remarked, ends, as it began, with the praise of God. "Be thou exalted" means, "Be thou lifted up, both in thyself, and in the praises of thy people" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-46.htm">Psalm 18:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So will we sing</span> <span class="cmt_word">and praise thy power.</span> We, at any rate, will do our part to exalt thee.

The address to God is now changed into an address to the king; not, however, expressive of the wishes, but of the confident expectation, of the speakers. Hengstenberg rightly regards <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-8.htm">Psalm 21:8</a> as the transition to the second half; for by its objective utterance concerning the king and God, it separates the language hitherto addressed to God, from the address to the king, which follows. We do not render <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-8.htm">Psalm 21:8</a>: and trusting in the favour of the Most High - he shall not be moved; the mercy is the response of the trust, which (trust) does not suffer him to be moved; on the expression, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-30.htm">Proverbs 10:30</a>. This inference is now expanded in respect to the enemies who desire to cause him to totter and fall. So far from any tottering, he, on the contrary, makes a victorious assault upon his foes. If the words had been addressed to Jahve, it ought, in order to keep up the connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-9.htm">Psalm 21:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/21-8.htm">Psalm 21:8</a>, at least to have been &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493; (his, i.e., the king's, enemies). What the people now hope on behalf of their king, they here express beforehand in the form of a prophecy. &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1500; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>) and &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; seq. acc. (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a>) are distinguished as: to reach towards, or up to anything, and to reach anything, attain it. Supposing &#1500; to represent the accusative, as e.g., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-6.htm">Psalm 69:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-9.htm">Psalm 21:9</a> would be a useless repetition. </body></html>
