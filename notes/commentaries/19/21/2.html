All our blessings are blessings of goodness, and are owing, not to any merit of ours, but only to God's goodness. But when God's blessings come sooner, and prove richer than we imagine; when they are given before we prayed for them, before we were ready for them, nay, when we feared the contrary; then it may be truly said that he prevented, or went before us, with them. Nothing indeed prevented, or went before Christ, but to mankind never was any favour more preventing than our redemption by Christ. Thou hast made him to be a universal, everlasting blessing to the world, in whom the families of the earth are, and shall be blessed; and so thou hast made him exceeding glad with the countenance thou hast given to his undertaking, and to him in the prosecution of it. The Spirit of prophecy rises from what related to the king, to that which is peculiar to Christ; none other is blessed for ever, much less a blessing for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast given him his heart's desire - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-4.htm">Psalm 20:4</a>.

The futures in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-2.htm">Psalm 20:2</a>, standing five times at the head of the climactic members of the parallelism, are optatives. &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-6.htm">Psalm 20:6</a>, also continues the chain of wishes, of which even &#1504;&#1512;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-15.htm">Psalm 69:15</a>) forms one of the links. The wishes of the people accompany both the prayer and the sacrifice. "The Name of the God of Jacob" is the self-manifesting power and grace of the God of Israel. &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; is used in poetry interchangeably with &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;, just like &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;. Alsh&#1498;ch refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-3.htm">Genesis 35:3</a>; and it is not improbable that the desire moulds itself after the fashion of the record of the fact there handed down to us. May Jahve, who, as the history of Jacob shows, hears (and answers) in the day of distress, hear the king; may the Name of the God of Jacob bear him away from his foes to a triumphant height. &#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; alternates with &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a>) in this sense. This intercession on the behalf of the praying one is made in the sanctuary on the heights of Zion, where Jahve sits enthroned. May He send him succour from thence, like auxiliary troops that decide the victory. The king offers sacrifice. He offers sacrifice according to custom before the commencement of the battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>., and cf. the phrase &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;), a whole burnt-offering and at the same time a meat or rather meal offering also, &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;;<p>(Note: This, though not occurring in the Old Testament, is the principal form of the plural, which, as even David Kimchi recognises in his Lexicon, points to a verb &#1502;&#1504;&#1495; (just as &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; point to &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1500;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1495;); whereas other old grammarians supposed &#1504;&#1495;&#1492; to be the root, and were puzzled with the traditional pronunciation menacho&#770;th, but without reason.)<p>for every whole offering and every shelamim - or peace-offering had a meat-offering and a drink-offering as its indispensable accompaniment. The word &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; is perfectly familiar in the ritual of the meal-offering. That portion of the meal-offering, only a part of which was placed upon the altar (to which, however, according to traditional practice, does not belong the accompanying meal-offering of the &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; &#1504;&#1505;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, which was entirely devoted to the altar), which ascended with the altar fire is called &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>), that which brings to remembrance with God him for whom it is offered up (not "incense," as Hupfeld renders it); for the designation of the offering of jealousy, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>, as "bringing iniquity to remembrance before God" shows, that in the meal-offering ritual &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; retains the very same meaning that it has in other instances. Every meal-offering is in a certain sense a &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; &#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; a esnes . Hence here the prayer that Jahve would graciously remember them is combined with the meal-offerings.<p>As regards the &#8219;olah, the wish "let fire from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>) turn it to ashes," would not be vain. But the language does not refer to anything extraordinary; and in itself the consumption of the offering to ashes (Bttcher) is no mark of gracious acceptance. Moreover, as a denominative from &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, fat ashes, &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; means "to clean from ashes," and not: to turn into ashes. On the other hand, &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; also signifies "to make fat," <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, and this effective signification is applied declaratively in this instance: may He find thy burnt-offering fat, which is equivalent to: may it be to Him a &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495; [an odour of satisfaction, a sweet-smelling savour]. The voluntative ah only occurs here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a> (which see) and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>, in the 3 pers.; and in this instance, just as with the cohortative in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a>, we have a change of the lengthening into a sharpening of the sound (cf. the exactly similar change of forms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-14.htm">Proverbs 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-13.htm">Ezekiel 25:13</a>) as is very frequently the case in &#1502;&#1492; for &#1502;&#1492;. The alteration to &#1497;&#1491;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; or &#1497;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; (Hitzig) is a felicitous but needless way of getting rid of the rare form. The explanation of the intensifying of the music here is, that the intercessory song of the choir is to be simultaneous with the presentation upon the altar (&#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1512;&#1492;). &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; is the resolution formed in the present wartime. "Because of thy salvation," i.e., thy success in war, is, as all the language is here, addressed to the king, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>, where it is addressed to Jahve, and intended of the victory accorded to him. It is needless to read &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; instead of &#1504;&#1491;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, after the rendering of the lxx megaluntheeso'metha. &#1504;&#1491;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; is a denominative from &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;: to wave a banner. In the closing line, the rejoicing of hope goes back again to the present and again assumes the form of an intercessory desire. </body></html>
