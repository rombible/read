The sacred imagery in St. John’s Revelation sets them before our eyes in such a manner, that no one can read the description whose heart will not burn within him, through impatient desire to behold them.” See Revelation, chapters 4., 7., 19., 21., 22.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-6 Happy the people whose king makes God's strength his confidence, and God's salvation his joy; who is pleased with all the advancements of God kingdom, and trusts God to support him in all he does for the service of it. All our blessings are blessings of goodness, and are owing, not to any merit of ours, but only to God's goodness. But when God's blessings come sooner, and prove richer than we imagine; when they are given before we prayed for them, before we were ready for them, nay, when we feared the contrary; then it may be truly said that he prevented, or went before us, with them. Nothing indeed prevented, or went before Christ, but to mankind never was any favour more preventing than our redemption by Christ. Thou hast made him to be a universal, everlasting blessing to the world, in whom the families of the earth are, and shall be blessed; and so thou hast made him exceeding glad with the countenance thou hast given to his undertaking, and to him in the prosecution of it. The Spirit of prophecy rises from what related to the king, to that which is peculiar to Christ; none other is blessed for ever, much less a blessing for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His glory is great in thy salvation - Not in himself; not in anything that he has done, but in what thou hast done. The fact that thou hast saved him, and the manner in which it has been done, has put upon him great honor. He felt indeed that his condition as king, and as to the prospects before him, was one of great "glory" or honor; but he felt at the same time that it was not in "himself," or for anything that he had done: it was only in the ""salvation"" which "God" had conferred upon him. Every child of God, in like manner, has great "glory" conferred upon him, and his "glory" will be great forever; but it is not in himself, or in virtue of anything that he has done. It is "great" in the "salvation" of God:<p>(a) in the "fact" that God has interposed to save him; and<p>(b) in the "manner" in which it has been done.<p>The highest honor that can be put upon man is in the fact that God will save him.<p>Honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him - <p>(a) In making him a king;<p>(b) in the victories and triumphs which thou hast now given him, placing on his head, as it were, a brighter crown;<p>(c) in the promised perpetuity of his reign.<p>So we may say of the ransomed sinner - the child of God - now. Honour and majesty have been laid on him:<p>(a) in the fact that God has redeemed him;<p>(b) in the manner in which this has been accomplished;<p>(c) in his adoption into the family of God;<p>(d) in the rank and dignity which he occupies as a child of God;<p>(e) in the hope of immortal blessedness beyond the grave. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6.

That is, the glory of the King Messiah is great in the Lord's salvation of him; delivering him from all his troubles and sorrows, and out of the hands of all his enemies, when he was raised from the dead, and was set at the right hand of God, and crowned with glory and honour: or the sense is, that his glory is great in the salvation of his people by him; it was his glory as Mediator to be appointed to be the Lord's salvation to them; and it being effected by him declares the glory and greatness of his person; and the nature of it is such as cannot fast of bringing glory to him; and such is the sense his people have of it, that it obliges them to ascribe the glory of it alone to him; <p>honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him; which is to be understood not of the honour and majesty of his divine nature, which are essential to him, and not laid upon him by any; nor of the glory which the saints attribute to him on account of their salvation by him; but of that which his Father has put upon him, and lies in the introduction of him into his glory after his sufferings and death, and resurrection from the dead; in exalting him at his right hand above all creatures and things; in giving him all power in heaven and in earth; in putting all the gifts of the Spirit into his hands, which he receiving gave to men, and in ordaining him Judge of quick and dead. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

David' s glory exceeds that of all other living men, through the "salvation" which God vouchsafes him. That salvation is partly temporal, consisting in deliverance from his foes; partly of an unearthly and spiritual character, arising out of his relationship to the coming Messiah. It is from the latter point of view, rather than the former, that it is said, <span class="cmt_word">Honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 20:7-9) While <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-2.htm">Psalm 20:2</a> were being sung the offering of the sacrifice was probably going on. Now, after a lengthened pause, there ascends a voice, probably the voice of one of the Levites, expressing the cheering assurance of the gracious acceptance of the offering that has been presented by the priest. With &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; or &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, the usual word to indicate the turning-point, the instantaneous entrance of the result of some previous process of prolonged duration, whether hidden or manifest (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-24.htm">1 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>), is introduced. howshiya` is the perfect of faith, which, in the certainty of being answered, realises the fulfilment in anticipation. The exuberance of the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> corresponds to the exuberance of feeling which thus finds expression.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> the answer is expected out of Zion, in the present instance it is looked for from God's holy heavens; for the God who sits enthroned in Zion is enthroned for ever in the heavens. His throne on earth is as it were the vestibule of His heavenly throne; His presence in the sanctuary of Israel is no limitation of His omnipresence; His help out of Zion is the help of the Celestial One and Him who is exalted above the heaven of heavens. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; does not here mean the fulness of might (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>), but the displays of power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-2.htm">Psalm 106:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-2.htm">Psalm 150:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1-11</a> :15), by which His right hand procures salvation, i.e., victory, for the combatant. The glory of Israel is totally different from that of the heathen, which manifests itself in boastful talk. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a> &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1497;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; must be supplied from the &#1504;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a> (lxx &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;  equals  &#1504;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>); &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;, to make laudatory mention of any matter, to extol, and indirectly therefore to take credit to one's self for it, to boast of it (cf. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a>). According to the Law Israel was forbidden to have any standing army; and the law touching the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>) speaks strongly against his keeping many horses. It was also the same under the judges, and at this time under David; but under Solomon, who acquired for himself horses and chariots in great number (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>), it was very different. It is therefore a confession that must belong to the time of David which is here made in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a>, viz., that Israel's glory in opposition to their enemies, especially the Syrians, is the sure defence and protection of the Name of their God alone. The language of David to Goliath is very similar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>. The preterites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-9.htm">Psalm 20:9</a> are praet. confidentiae. It is, as Luther says, "a song of triumph before the victory, a shout of joy before succour." Since &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; does not mean to stand, but to rise, &#1511;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; assumes the present superiority of the enemy. But the position of affairs changes: those who stand fall, and those who are lying down rise up; the former remain lying, the latter keep the field. The Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491; signifies to show one's self firm, strong, courageous; like &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/147-6.htm">Psalm 147:6</a>, to strengthen, confirm, recover, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; to be compact, firm, cogn. Arab. a&#770;d f. i., inf. aid, strength; as, e.g., the Koran (Sur. xxxviii. 16) calls David dha&#770;-l-aidi, possessor of strength, II ajjada, to strengthen, support, and Arab. 'dd, inf. add, strength superiority, V ta&#772;ddada, to show one's self strong, brave, courageous. </body></html>
