The success with which God blessed David, was a type of the total overthrow of all Christ's enemies. Those who might have had Christ to rule and save them, but rejected him and fought against him, shall find the remembrance of it a worm that dies not. God makes sinners willing by his grace, receives them to his favour, and delivers them from the wrath to come. May he exalt himself, by his all-powerful grace, in our hearts, destroying all the strong-holds of sin and Satan. How great should be our joy and praise to behold our Brother and Friend upon the throne, and for all the blessings we may expect from him! yet he delights in his exalted state, as enabling him to confer happiness and glory on poor sinners, who are taught to love and trust in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger - Thou shalt consume or destroy them, "as if" they "were" burned in a heated oven. Or, they shall burn, as if they were a flaming oven; that is, they would be wholly consumed. The word rendered "oven" - &#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  tannu&#770;r - means either an "oven" or a "furnace." It is rendered "furnace and furnaces" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-11.htm">Nehemiah 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-38.htm">Nehemiah 12:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>; and, as here, "oven" or "ovens," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-3.htm">Exodus 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-9.htm">Leviticus 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-35.htm">Leviticus 11:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-10.htm">Lamentations 5:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-4.htm">Hosea 7:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-6.htm">Hosea 7:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>. It does not occur elsewhere. The oven among the Hebrews was in the form of a large "pot," and was heated from within by placing the wood inside of it. Of course, while being heated, it had the appearance of a furnace. The meaning here is that the wicked would be consumed or destroyed "as if" they were such a burning oven; as if they were set on fire, and burned up.<p>The Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath - The same idea of the utter destruction of the wicked is here presented under another form - that they would be destroyed as if the earth should open and swallow them up. Perhaps the allusion in the language is to the case of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-17.htm">Psalm 106:17</a>.<p>And the fire shall devour them - The same idea under another form. The wrath of God would utterly destroy them. That wrath is often represented under the image of "fire."

This will be <p>in the time of thine anger, or "of thy countenance" (d); not his gracious, but his angry countenance; when he shall put on a fierce look, and appear as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, and stir up all his wrath; <p>the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath; not that they shall be annihilated; their souls remain after death, and their bodies after the resurrection; and will be tormented with the fire of God's wrath for ever and ever; the phrase is expressive of utter ruin, of the destruction of soul and body in hell; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-25.htm">Psalm 35:25</a>; Jarchi takes it to be a prayer, "may the Lord swallow them up", &amp;c. <p>and the fire shall devour them; that is, as the Targum paraphrases it, the fire of hell; or, however, it designs the wrath of God, who is a consuming fire; or that fiery indignation of his, which shall devour the adversaries; which comes down upon them either in temporal judgments here, or in their everlasting destruction hereafter. <p>(c) Vide Aben Ezram in loc.

The phrase is figurative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm" title="For, behold, the day comes, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yes, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes shall burn them up, said the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.">Malachi 4:1</a>): yet there may be an allusion to the terrible vengeance inflicted on the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm" title="And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon.

Severe suffering is continually compared in Scripture to confinement in an oven or furnace (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-51.htm">1 Kings 8:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Ezekiel 22:18, 20, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). And we may best understand the present passage to mean simply that in the time of his anger David would subject such of his enemies as fell into his hands to very terrible sufferings. (See, as showing what extreme severities David did sometimes inflict on captured enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a> which is to the point, as also is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</span> The metaphor is followed up, with the addition that what was previously attributed to David alone is here declared to have the sanction of God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 21:4-5) "Blessings of good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-25.htm">Proverbs 24:25</a>) are those which consist of good, i.e., true good fortune. The verb &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, because used of the favour which meets and presents one with some blessing, is construed with a double accusative, after the manner of verbs of putting on and bestowing (Ges. &#1431;139). Since <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a> cannot be intended to refer to David's first coronation, but to the preservation and increase of the honour of his kingship, this particularisation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a> sounds like a prediction of what is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-30.htm">2 Samuel 22:30</a> : after the conquest of the Ammonitish royal city Rabbah David set the Ammonitish crown (&#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514;), which is renowned for the weight of its gold and its ornamentation with precious stones, upon his head. David was then advanced in years, and in consequence of heavy guilt, which, however, he had overcome by penitence and laying hold on the mercy of God, was come to the brink of the grave. He, worthy of death, still lived; and the victory over the Syro-Ammonitish power was a pledge to him of God's faithfulness in fulfilling his promises. It is contrary to the tenour of the words to say that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-5.htm">Psalm 21:5</a> does not refer to length of life, but to hereditary succession to the throne. To wish any one that he may live &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, and especially a king, is a usual thing, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-31.htm">1 Kings 1:31</a>, and frequently. The meaning is, may the life of the king be prolonged to an indefinitely distant day. What the people have desired elsewhere, they here acknowledge as bestowed upon the king. </body></html>
