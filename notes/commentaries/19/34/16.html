(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-10.htm" title="Their fruit shall you destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.">Psalm 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-17.htm" title="His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.">Job 18:17</a>, &c)<p>This verse, according to the sense, should certainly change places with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm" title="The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry.">Psalm 34:15</a>. This would disarrange the acrostic, bringing <span class= "ital">pe </span>before <span class= "ital">ayin; </span>but, as in Lamentations 2, 3, 4 the same sequence of letters occurs, we are led to the conclusion that the order of the alphabet was not definitely or invariably fixed in respect of these two letters, a license intelligible enough when we remember that <span class= "ital">tsadde, </span>which follows <span class= "ital">pe, </span>was often interchanged with <span class= "ital">ayin, </span>which precedes it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:11-22 Let young persons set out in life with learning the fear of the Lord, if they desire true comfort here, and eternal happiness hereafter. Those will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good a Master. All aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than the present world; for man's life on earth consists but of few days, and those full of trouble. What man is he that would see the good of that where all bliss is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts. That religion promises best which creates watchfulness over the heart and over the tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study to be useful, and to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursue it; be willing to deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It is the constant practice of real believers, when in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their constant comfort that he hears them. The righteous are humbled for sin, and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is more needful to true godliness than a contrite heart, broken off from every self-confidence. In this soil every grace will flourish, and nothing can encourage such a one but the free, rich grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous are taken under the special protection of the Lord, yet they have their share of crosses in this world, and there are those that hate them. Both from the mercy of Heaven, and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the righteous must be many. But whatever troubles befal them, shall not hurt their souls, for God keeps them from sinning in troubles. No man is desolate, but he whom God has forsaken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The face of the Lord - This phrase is synonymous with that in the previous verse: "The eyes of the Lord." The meaning is, that the righteous and the wicked are alike under the eye of God; the one for protection, the other for punishment. Neither of them can escape His notice; but at all times, and in all circumstances, they are equally seen by Him.<p>Is against them that do evil - The wicked; all that do wrong. In the former verse the statement is, that the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, that is, for their protection; in this case, by a change of the preposition in the original, the statement is, that His face is "against" them that do evil, that is, He observes them to bring judgment upon them.<p>To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth - To cut off themselves, - their families - and all memorials of them, so that they shall utterly be forgotten among people. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13-15</a>. So, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>, it is said, "The memory of the just is blessed; but the name of the wicked shall rot." Two things are implied here:<p>(1) That it is "desirable" to be remembered after we are dead. There is in us a deep-rooted principle, of great value to the cause of virtue, which prompts us to "desire" that we may be held in grateful recollection by mankind after we have passed away; that is, which prompts us to do something in our lives, the remembrance of which the world will not "willingly let die." - Milton.<p>(2) The other idea is, that there is a state of things on earth which has a tendency to cause the remembrance of the wicked to die out, or to make people forget them. There is nothing to make men desire to retain their recollection, or to rear monuments to them. People are indeed remembered who are of bad eminence in crime; but the world will forget a wicked man just as soon as it can. This is stated here as a reason particularly addressed to the young <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-11.htm">Psalm 34:11</a> why they should seek God, and pursue the ways of righteousness. The motive is, that men will "gladly" retain the remembrance of those who are good; of those who have done anything worthy to be remembered, but that a life of sin will make men desire to forget as soon as possible all those who practice it. This is not a low and base motive to be addressed to the young. That is a high and honorable principle which makes us wish that our names should be cherished by those who are to live after us, and is one of the original principles by which God keeps up virtue in the world - one of those arrangements, those safeguards of virtue, by which we are prompted to do right, and to abstain from that which is wrong. It is greatly perverted, indeed, to purposes of ambition, but, in itself, the desire not to be forgotten when we are dead contributes much to the industry, the enterprise, and the benevolence of the world, and is one of the most efficacious means for preserving us from sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. face &#8230; against&#8212;opposed to them (Le 17:10; 20:3).<p>cut off the remembrance&#8212;utterly destroy (Ps 109:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The face of the Lord, </span> i.e. his anger, oft called his <span class="ital">face</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10</a> 20:5 <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.">Jeremiah 44:11</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm" title="The anger of the LORD has divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.">Lamentations 4:16</a></span>, because anger discovers itself in the face. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Them that do evil, </span> i.e. whose common course, and study, arid business it is to do evil; for else <span class="ital">there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm" title="For there is not a just man on earth, that does good, and sins not.">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth</span>; utterly to deprive both them and their children of that worldly happiness, which is the only thing that they desire, and seek by their wicked courses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The face of the Lord is against them that do evil,....
