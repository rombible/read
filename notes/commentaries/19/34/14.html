Practical good must be added.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:11-22 Let young persons set out in life with learning the fear of the Lord, if they desire true comfort here, and eternal happiness hereafter. Those will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good a Master. All aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than the present world; for man's life on earth consists but of few days, and those full of trouble. What man is he that would see the good of that where all bliss is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts. That religion promises best which creates watchfulness over the heart and over the tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study to be useful, and to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursue it; be willing to deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It is the constant practice of real believers, when in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their constant comfort that he hears them. The righteous are humbled for sin, and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is more needful to true godliness than a contrite heart, broken off from every self-confidence. In this soil every grace will flourish, and nothing can encourage such a one but the free, rich grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous are taken under the special protection of the Lord, yet they have their share of crosses in this world, and there are those that hate them. Both from the mercy of Heaven, and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the righteous must be many. But whatever troubles befal them, shall not hurt their souls, for God keeps them from sinning in troubles. No man is desolate, but he whom God has forsaken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Depart from evil - From all evil; from vice and crime in every form.<p>And do good - Do good to all people, and in all the relations of life.<p>Seek peace - Strive to live in peace with all the world.

Make it an object of desire, and put forth constant efforts to live in peace with all human beings. There can be no doubt that this is appropriate advice to one who wishes to lengthen out his days. We have only to remember how many are cut down by indulging in a quarrelsome, litigious, and contentious spirit - by seeking revenge - by quarrels, duels, wars, and strife - to see the wisdom of this counsel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13, 14.

First, he enjoins negative goodness - "depart from evil," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do nothing that is wrong; break no laws of God, no command of conscience; have a conscience void of offence, both towards God and towards man. Secondly, he requires positive goodness - "Do good;" i.e. actively perform the will of God from the heart; discharge every duty; practise every virtue; carry out the precepts of the moral law in every particular. <span class="cmt_word">Seek peace, and pursue it.</span> It is not clear why this virtue - one of many - is specially enjoined; but probably some circumstances of the time made the recommendation advisable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 34:8-11) This praise is supported by a setting forth of the gracious protection under which God's saints continually are.

This name is not collective (Calvin, Hupfeld, Kamphausen, and others). He, the One, encampeth round about them, in so far as He is the Captain of the host of Jahve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>), and consequently is accompanied by a host of inferior ministering angels; or insofar as He can, as being a spirit not limited by space, furnish protection that covers them on every side. &#1495;&#1504;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-8.htm">Zechariah 9:8</a>) is perhaps an allusion to &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>., that angel-camp which joined itself to Jacob's camp, and surrounded it like a barricade or carrago.
