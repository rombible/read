Those will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good a Master. All aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than the present world; for man's life on earth consists but of few days, and those full of trouble. What man is he that would see the good of that where all bliss is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts. That religion promises best which creates watchfulness over the heart and over the tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study to be useful, and to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursue it; be willing to deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It is the constant practice of real believers, when in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their constant comfort that he hears them. The righteous are humbled for sin, and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is more needful to true godliness than a contrite heart, broken off from every self-confidence. In this soil every grace will flourish, and nothing can encourage such a one but the free, rich grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous are taken under the special protection of the Lord, yet they have their share of crosses in this world, and there are those that hate them. Both from the mercy of Heaven, and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the righteous must be many. But whatever troubles befal them, shall not hurt their souls, for God keeps them from sinning in troubles. No man is desolate, but he whom God has forsaken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous - This is another of the ways in which the psalmist says that life will be lengthened out, or that those who desire life may find it. The Lord will be the protector of the righteous; he will watch over and defend them. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-7.htm">Job 36:7</a>.<p>And his ears are open unto their cry - That is, when in trouble and in danger. He will hear them, and will deliver them. All this seems to be stated as the result of the experience of the psalmist himself; He had found that the eyes of God had been upon him in his dangers, and that His ears had been open when he called upon Him <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>; and now, from his own experience, he assures others that the way to secure life and to find prosperity is to pursue such a course as will ensure the favor and protection of God. The general thought is, that virtue and religion - the love of truth, and the love of peace - the favor and friendship of God, will tend to lengthen out life, and to make it prosperous and happy. All the statements in the Bible concur in this, and all the experience of man goes to confirm it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. eyes of the Lord are upon&#8212;(Ps 32:8; 33:18).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/34.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>15 The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.<p>16 The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.<p>17 The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles,<p>18 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.<p>19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.<p>20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.<p>21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.<p>22 The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a><p>"The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous." He observes them with approval and tender consideration; they are so dear to him that he cannot take his eyes off them; he watches each one of them as carefully and intently as if there were only that one creature in the universe. "His ears are open unto their cry." His eyes and ears are thus both turned by the Lord towards his saints; his whole mind is occupied about them: if slighted by all others they are not neglected by him. Their cry he hears at once, even as a mother is sure to hear her sick babe; the cry may be broken, plaintive, unhappy, feeble, unbelieving, yet the Father's quick ear catches each note of lament or appeal, and he is not slow to answer his children's voice.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a><p>"The face of the Lord is against them that do evil." God is not indifferent to the deeds of sinners, but he sets his face against them, as we say, being determined that they shall have no countenance and support, but shall be thwarted and defeated. He is determinately resolved that the ungodly shall not prosper; he sets himself with all his might to overthrow them. "To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth." He will stamp out their fires, their honour shall be turned into shame, their names forgotten or accursed. Utter destruction shall be the lot of all the ungodly.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a><p>"The righteous cry." Like Israel in Egypt, they cry out under the heavy yoke of oppression, both of sin, temptation, care and grief. "And the Lord heareth;" he is like the night-watchman, who no sooner hears the alarm-bell than he flies to relieve those who need him. "And delivereth them out of all their troubles." No net of trouble can so hold us that the Lord cannot free us. Our afflictions may be numerous and complicated, but prayer can set us free from them all, for the Lord will show himself strong on our behalf.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is added to prove his last assertion, to wit, that the practice of these duties, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-13.htm" title="Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking guile.">Psalm 34:13</a>,14</span>, is the true and best, and indeed the only, way to see that good proposed and promised <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-12.htm" title="What man is he that desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good?">Psalm 34:12</a></span>; both because such righteous persons, howsoever they may meet with affronts and injuries from men, are under the special care and favour of God, in this verse; and those who do the evils there forbidden shall find to their cost that God is their enemy, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-16.htm" title="The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.">Psalm 34:16</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,.... These are the same with them that fear the Lord, and do good; not that they become righteous in the sight of God, or are justified before him, by their fear of him, and by their good works; but these are the fruits and effects of grace, showing them to be righteous persons; for it is only by the righteousness of Christ that men are righteous before God: and upon these the eyes of the Lord are; not only his eye of Providence, to watch over them, protect them, and supply them with good things, but his eye of love; with complacency and delight he looks upon them, as clothed with the righteousness of his son; and it is with pleasure he looks upon them, that being well pleasing in his sight; seeing by it the law is magnified and made honourable; nor does he ever withdraw his eyes from them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-7.htm">Job 36:7</a>; <p>and his ears are open unto their cry; for though they are righteous, they are sometimes in distress; their afflictions are many; the good days they are to see are hereafter; and at those times they cry unto the Lord; which is to be understood of prayer, and of the vehemency and fervency of it, when they have the ear of God, and he shows himself to be a God hearing and answering prayer. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>.

The specific statement of ver. 6 is now generalized. What God had done in the case of the psalmist, he will do in all other similar cases.

This name is not collective (Calvin, Hupfeld, Kamphausen, and others). He, the One, encampeth round about them, in so far as He is the Captain of the host of Jahve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>), and consequently is accompanied by a host of inferior ministering angels; or insofar as He can, as being a spirit not limited by space, furnish protection that covers them on every side. &#1495;&#1504;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-8.htm">Zechariah 9:8</a>) is perhaps an allusion to &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>., that angel-camp which joined itself to Jacob's camp, and surrounded it like a barricade or carrago.
