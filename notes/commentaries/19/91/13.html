Those who rightly know God, will set their love upon him. They by prayer constantly call upon him. His promise is, that he will in due time deliver the believer out of trouble, and in the mean time be with him in trouble. The Lord will manage all his worldly concerns, and preserve his life on earth, so long as it shall be good for him. For encouragement in this he looks unto Jesus. He shall live long enough; till he has done the work he was sent into this world for, and is ready for heaven. Who would wish to live a day longer than God has some work to do, either by him or upon him? A man may die young, yet be satisfied with living. But a wicked man is not satisfied even with long life. At length the believer's conflict ends; he has done for ever with trouble, sin, and temptation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/91.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder - Thou shalt be safe among dangers, as if the rage of the lion were restrained, and he became like a lamb, and as if the poisonous tooth of the serpent were extracted. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>. The word used here to denote the "lion" is a poetic term, not employed in prose. The word rendered "adder" is, in the margin, asp. The Hebrew word - &#1508;&#1514;&#1503;  pethen - commonly means viper, asp, or adder.

This is an impregnable defence (a) in war-times, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-5.htm">Psalm 91:5</a>, against nightly surprises, and in the battle by day; (b) in times of pestilence, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-6.htm">Psalm 91:6</a>, when the destroying angel, who passes through and destroys the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4</a>), can do no harm to him who has taken refuge in God, either in the midnight or the noontide hours.
