I</span>.—The especial difficulty of this psalm, its abrupt changes of person, meets us at the outset. The text literally rendered, runs: “<span class= "ital">He sitting in the hiding place of the Most High; In the shadow of the Almighty he lodgeth, I say to Jehovah, My refuge and my fortress, My God, I trust in Him. </span>The change in the last clause presents no particular difficulty, as many similar instances occur; but that from the <span class= "ital">third </span>person, in the first verse, to the <span class= "ital">first, </span>in the second, is very awkward, and many shifts have been adopted to get out of it. The best is to supply the word <span class= "ital">blessed: “</span>Blessed is he that,” &c<span class= "note">[16]</span> The different names for God employed here should be noticed. By their accumulation the poet makes the sum of assurance doubly sure.<p><span class= "note">[16] The omission of this word by a copyist would be very natural, from its confusion with the numerical heading of the psalm and the initial letter of the word that now begins it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/91.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm" title="He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.">Psalm 91:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">He that dwelleth in the secret place, </span>&c. — He that makes God his habitation and refuge, as he is called <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-9.htm" title="Because you have made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, your habitation;">Psalm 91:9</a>, that has recourse to him, and relies on him in his dangers and difficulties; that has access to him, intercourse with him, and worships within the veil, living a life of constant communion with him; <span class="ital">shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty — </span>He shall not be disappointed of his hope, but shall find a quiet and safe resting- place under the divine care. A <span class="ital">shadow, </span>in Scripture, often signifies protection. But there evidently seems to be an allusion to the most holy place in the tabernacle and temple, and to the outstretched wings of the cherubim covering the ark and mercy-seat: see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm" title="For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up on a rock.">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm" title="You are my hiding place; you shall preserve me from trouble; you shall compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.">Psalm 32:7</a>. And it is as if the psalmist had said, He shall dwell like the ark in the holy of holies, under the immediate shadow and protection of the Divine Majesty. It is justly observed here by Dr. Horne, that “in all dangers, whether spiritual or corporal, the members of Christ’s mystical body may reflect, with comfort, that they are under the same almighty Protector.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/91.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>91:1-8 He that by faith chooses God for his protector, shall find all in him that he needs or can desire. And those who have found the comfort of making the Lord their refuge, cannot but desire that others may do so. The spiritual life is protected by Divine grace from the temptations of Satan, which are as the snares of the fowler, and from the contagion of sin, which is a noisome pestilence. Great security is promised to believers in the midst of danger. Wisdom shall keep them from being afraid without cause, and faith shall keep them from being unduly afraid. Whatever is done, our heavenly Father's will is done; and we have no reason to fear. God's people shall see, not only God's promises fulfilled, but his threatenings. Then let sinners come unto the Lord upon his mercy-seat, through the Redeemer's name; and encourage others to trust in him also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/91.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that dwelleth - Everyone that so dwells. The proposition is universal, and is designed to embrace all who are in this condition. It is true of one; it is true of all. The word rendered "dwelleth" here is a participle from the verb to "sit," and here means "sitting:" literally, "sitting in the secret place," etc. The idea is that of calm repose; of resting; of sitting down - as one does in his dwelling.<p>In the secret place - On the meaning of this see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>.

That is his home - his resting place - where he lodges, or passes the night.

Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>. This is a general statement, and is designed as an introduction to the whole psalm, or as expressing what the psalm is intended to illustrate, "the blessedness" of the man who thus dwells with God; who makes him his friend; who makes the home of God his home. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/91.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 91<p>Ps 91:1-16. David is the most probable author; and the pestilence, mentioned in 2Sa 24:13-15, the most probable of any special occasion to which the Psalm may refer. The changes of person allowable in poetry are here frequently made.<p>1. dwelleth in the secret place&#8212;(Ps 27:5; 31:20) denotes nearness to God. Such as do so abide or lodge secure from assaults, and can well use the terms of trust in Ps 91:2.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/91.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.<p>2 I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will Itrust.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a><p>"He that dwelleth, in the secret place of the most High." The blessings here promised are not for all believers, but for those who live in close fellowship with God. Every child of God looks towards the inner sanctuary and the mercy-seat, yet all do not dwell in the most holy place; they run to it at times, and enjoy occasional approaches, but they do not habitually reside in the mysterious presence. Those who through rich grace obtain unusual and continuous communion with God, so as to abide in Christ and Christ in them, become possessors of rare and special benefits, which are missed by those who follow afar off, and grieve the Holy Spirit of God. Into the secret place those only come who know the love of God in Christ Jesus, and those only dwell there to whom to live is Christ. To them the veil is rent, the mercy-seat is revealed, the covering cherubs are manifest, and the awful glory of the Most High is apparent: these, like Simeon, have the Holy Ghost upon them, and like Anna they depart not from the temple; they are the courtiers of the Great King, the valiant men who keep watch around the bed of Solomon, the virgin souls who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. Elect out of the elect, they have "attained unto the first three," and shall walk with their Lord in white, for they are worthy. Sitting down in the august presence-chamber where shines the mystic light of the Sheckinah, they know what it is to be raised up together, and to be made to sit together with Christ in the heavenlies, and of them it is truly said that their conversation is in heaven. Special grace like theirs brings with it special immunity. Outer court worshippers little know what belongs to the inner sanctuary, or surely they would press on until the place of nearness and divine familiarity became theirs. Those who are the Lord's constant guests shall find that he will never suffer any to be injured within his gates; he has eaten the covenant salt with them, and is pledged for their protection.<p>"Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty." The Omnipotent Lord will shield all those who dwell with him, they shall remain under his care as guests under the protection of their host. In the most holy place the wings of the cherubim were the most conspicuous objects, and they probably suggested to the Psalmist the expression here employed. Those who commune with God are safe with him, no evil can reach them, for the outstretched wings of his power and love cover them from all harm. This protection is constant - they abide under it, and it is all-sufficient, for it is the shadow of the Almighty, whose omnipotence will surely screen them from all attack. No shelter can be imagined at all comparable to the protection of Jehovah's own shadow. The Almighty himself is where his shadow is, and hence those who dwell in his secret place are shielded by himself. What a shade in the day of noxious heat! What a refuge in the hour of deadly storm! Communion with God is safety. The more closely we cling to our Almighty Father the more confident may we be.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-2.htm">Psalm 91:2</a><p>"I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress." To take up a general truth and make it our own by personal faith is the highest wisdom. It is but poor comfort to say 'the Lord is a refuge,' but to say he is my refuge, is the essence of consolation. Those who believe should also speak - "I will say," for such bold avowals honour God and lead others to seek the same confidence. Men are apt enough to proclaim their doubts, and even to boast of them, indeed there is a party nowadays of the most audacious pretenders to culture and thought, who glory in casting suspicion upon everything; hence it becomes the duty of all true believers to speak out and testify with calm courage to their own well-grounded reliance upon their God. Let others say what they will, be it ours to say of the Lord, "he is our refuge." But what we say we must prove by our actions, we must fly to the Lord for shelter, and not to an arm of flesh. The bird flies away to the thicket, and the fox hastens to its hole, every creature uses its refuge in the hour of danger, and even so in all peril or fear of peril let us flee unto Jehovah, the Eternal Protector of his own. Let us, when we are secure in the Lord, rejoice that our position is unassailable, for he is our fortress as well as our refuge. No moat, portcullis, drawbridge, wall, battlement and donjon, could make us so secure as we are when the attributes of the Lord of Hosts environ us around. Behold this day the Lord is to us instead of walls and bulwarks! Our ramparts defy the leaguered hosts of hell. Foes in flesh, and foes in ghostly guise are alike baulked of their prey when the Lord of Hosts stands between us and their fury, and all other evil forces are turned aside. Walls cannot keep out the pestilence, but the Lord can.<p>As if it were not enough to call the Lord his refuge and fortress, he adds, "My God I in him will I trust." Now he can say no more; "my God" means all, and more than all, that heart can conceive by way of security. It was most meet that he should say "in him will I trust," since to deny faith to such a one were wilful wickedness and wanton insult. He who dwells in an impregnable fortress, naturally trusts in it; and shall not he who dwells in God feel himself well at ease, and repose his soul in safety? O that we more fully carried out the Psalmist's resolve! We have trusted in God let us trust him still. He has never failed us, why then should we suspect him? To trust in man is natural to fallen nature, to trust in God should be as natural to regenerated nature. Where there is every reason and warrant for faith, we ought to place our confidence without hesitancy or wavering. Dear reader, pray for grace to say, "In him will I trust." <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The penman of this Psalm is uncertain.

Christ, the Son of God, is sometimes compared to the shadow of a rock, or tree, which screens and shelters from heat; as he preserves his people from the heat of a fiery law, the flaming sword of justice, the wrath of God, the fiery darts of Satan, and the fury of persecutors: under this shadow do they abide or lodge all night, safe and secure, as the word (o) signifies: the Targum calls this shadow the shadow of the clouds of glory; the Arabic version, "the shadow of the God of heaven." <p>(m) So in Tikkune Zohar, correct. 20. fol. 50. 1.((n) T.

Loving faith on man’s part shall be met by faithful love on God’s part” (Kay). Such is the sense of the A.V., which is certainly the most natural rendering of the verse. It is however rejected by most modern commentators as tautological. The predicate, it is said, simply repeats the subject, for the verb <span class="ital">shall abide</span>, or <span class="ital">lodge</span>, does not bear the emphatic meaning of permanent sojourn. But the verb is not used of temporary sojourn only (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-13.htm" title="His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.">Psalm 25:13</a>), and if the emphasis is on the words <span class="ital">in the shelter of the Almighty</span>, the second line is not merely a repetition of the first.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Other renderings which have been suggested are (1) <span class="ital">As one that dwelleth in the covert of the Most High, that lodgeth in the shadow of the Almighty, I will say</span>, &c.

(2) With the insertion of a word at the beginning of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm" title="He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.">Psalm 91:1</a></span>, <span class="ital">Happy is the man that dwelleth … that lodgeth … that saith</span> …; an emendation plausible enough in itself, but without any support from the Ancient Versions. (3) With a slight change of text, <span class="ital">He that dwelleth … that lodgeth … saith of Jehovah</span>. This emendation has much to commend it. It is supported by the LXX (<span class="greekheb">ἐρεῖ</span>), and it gets rid of the supposed tautology, as well as of the somewhat perplexing first person <span class="ital">I will say</span> in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-2.htm" title="I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.">Psalm 91:2</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But it is unnecessary if <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm" title="He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.">Psalm 91:1</a></span> is explained as above; the gain to the sense is doubtful; and the elimination of the first person destroys a feature of the Psalm.

Luther's rendering: Siebenzig Jar, wens hoch kompt so sinds achtzig (seventy years, or at the furthest eighty years), as Symmachus also meant by his &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#837; (in Chrysostom), is confirmed by the Talmudic &#1492;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506; &#1500;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, "to attain to extreme old age" (B. Mo&#1499;d katan, 28a), and rightly approved of by Hitzig and Olshausen. &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; signifies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-16.htm">Psalm 71:16</a> full strength, here full measure. Seventy, or at most eighty years, were the average sum of the extreme term of life to which the generation dying out in the wilderness attained. &#1493;&#1512;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; the lxx renders &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, but &#1512;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; is not equivalent to &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501;. The verb &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; signifies to behave violently, e.g., of importunate entreaty, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm">Proverbs 6:3</a>, of insolent treatment, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a>, whence &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; (here &#1512;&#1492;&#1489;), violence, impetuosity, and more especially a boastful vaunting appearance or coming forward, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-13.htm">Job 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>. The poet means to say that everything of which our life is proud (riches, outward appearance, luxury, beauty, etc.), when regarded in the right light, is after all only &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, inasmuch as it causes us trouble and toil, and &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, because without any true intrinsic merit and worth. To this second predicate is appended the confirmatory clause. &#1495;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is infin. adverb. from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> : speedily, swiftly (Symmachus, the Quinta, and Jerome). The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; signifies transire in all the Semitic dialects; and following this signification, which is applied transitively in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>, the Jewish expositors and Schultens correctly render: nam transit velocissime. Following upon the perfect &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;, the modus consecutivus &#1493;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1508;&#1492; maintains its retrospective signification. The strengthening of this mood by means of the intentional ah is more usual with the 1st pers. sing., e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-6.htm">Genesis 32:6</a>, than with the 1st pers. plur., as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11</a>; Ew. 232, g. The poet glances back from the end of life to the course of life. And life, with all of which it had been proud, appears as an empty burden; for it passed swiftly by and we fled away, we were borne away with rapid flight upon the wings of the past.<p>Such experience as this ought to urge one on to the fear of God; but how rarely does this happen! and yet the fear of God is the condition (stipulation) and the beginning of wisdom. The verb &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-11.htm">Psalm 90:11</a>, just as it in general denotes not merely notional but practically living and efficient knowledge, is here used of a knowledge which makes that which is known conduce to salvation. The meaning of &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; is determined in accordance with this. The suffix is here either gen. subj.: according to Thy fearfulness (&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>), or gen. obj.: according to the fear that is due to Thee, which in itself is at once (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>) more natural, and here designates the knowledge which is so rarely found, as that which is determined by the fear of God, as a truly religious knowledge. Such knowledge Moses supplicates for himself and for Israel: to number our days teach us rightly to understand. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; signifies "he does not know it to be otherwise, he is well aware of it," shows how &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is meant. Hitzig, contrary to the accentuation, draws it to &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;; but "to number our days" is in itself equivalent to "hourly to contemplate the fleeting character and brevity of our lifetime;" and &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; prays for a true qualification for this, and one that accords with experience. The future that follows is well adapted to the call, as frequently aim and result. But &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; is not to be taken, with Ewald and Hitzig, in the signification of bringing as an offering, a meaning this verb cannot have of itself alone (why should it not have been &#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;?). Bttcher also erroneously renders it after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a> : "that we may bring wisdom into the heart," which ought to be &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, deriving its meaning from agriculture, signifies "to carry off, obtain, gain, prop. to bring in," viz., into the barn, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-10.htm">2 Samuel 9:10</a>, Hagg. Psa 1:6; the produce of the field, and in a general way gain or profit, is hence called &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;. A wise heart is the fruit which one reaps or garners in from such numbering of the days, the gain which one carries off from so constantly reminding one's self of the end. &#1500;&#1489;&#1489; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is a poetically intensified expression for &#1500;&#1489; &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, just as &#1500;&#1489; &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a> signifies a calm easy heart. </body></html>
