Those who rightly know God, will set their love upon him. They by prayer constantly call upon him. His promise is, that he will in due time deliver the believer out of trouble, and in the mean time be with him in trouble. The Lord will manage all his worldly concerns, and preserve his life on earth, so long as it shall be good for him. For encouragement in this he looks unto Jesus. He shall live long enough; till he has done the work he was sent into this world for, and is ready for heaven. Who would wish to live a day longer than God has some work to do, either by him or upon him? A man may die young, yet be satisfied with living. But a wicked man is not satisfied even with long life. At length the believer's conflict ends; he has done for ever with trouble, sin, and temptation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/91.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall bear thee up ... - As if they took hold of thee, and held thee up, when about to fall.<p>Lest thou dash thy foot ... - Lest you should stumble and fall.

Which denotes the strength and power of angels to carry the saints in their hands; their tender care of them, such as a parent or nurse have of children; the helpless condition of the people of God, who are like infants, and need to be dealt with after this manner; the condescension of angels to take such an office on them, in submission to the will of God; the constant view they have of the saints, being always in their hands, and so in sight: thus they bear them, up in life, and at death carry their souls to Abraham's bosom: <p>lest thou dash thy foot against a stone; lest they fall into sin, or into any calamity and distress; lest the least hurt or mischief befall them, or the least injury be done them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a>.

What is meant is death, or "he who has the power of death," <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>. "The snare of the fowler" is a figure for the peril of one's life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>. In connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a> we have to call to mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a> : God protects His own as an eagle with its large strong wing. &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; is nom. unitatis, a pinion, to &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>; and the Hiph. &#1492;&#1505;&#1498;, from &#1505;&#1499;&#1498;, with the dative of the object, like the Kal in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/140-8.htm">Psalm 140:8</a>, signifies to afford covering, protection. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, according to its stem-word, is that which encompasses anything round about, and here beside &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, a weapon of defence surrounding the body on all sides; therefore not corresponding to the Syriac sh&#803;a&#772;rta&#772;', a stronghold (&#1505;&#1492;&#1512;, &#1502;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;), but to Syriac sabra&#772;', a shield. The Targum translates &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; with &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1488;, &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492; with &#1506;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488;, which points to the round parma. &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; is the truth of the divine promises. This is an impregnable defence (a) in war-times, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-5.htm">Psalm 91:5</a>, against nightly surprises, and in the battle by day; (b) in times of pestilence, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-6.htm">Psalm 91:6</a>, when the destroying angel, who passes through and destroys the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4</a>), can do no harm to him who has taken refuge in God, either in the midnight or the noontide hours. The future &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; is a more rhythmical and, in the signification to rage (as of disease) and to vanish away, a more usual form instead of &#1497;&#1500;&#1498;. The lxx, Aquila, and Symmachus erroneously associate the demon name &#1513;&#1473;&#1491; with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;. It is a metaplastic (as if formed from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; morf de) future for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>, &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>, &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, frangetur. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a> a hypothetical protasis: si cadant; the preterite would signify cediderint, Ew. 357, b. With &#1512;&#1511; that which will solely and exclusively take place is introduced. Burk correctly renders: nullam cum peste rem habebis, nisi ut videas. Only a spectator shalt thou be, and that with thine own eyes, being they self inaccessible and left to survive, conscious that thou thyself art a living one in contrast with those who are dying. And thou shalt behold, like Israel on the night of the Passover, the just retribution to which the evil-doers fall a prey. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, recompense, retribution, is a hapaxlegomenon, cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>. Ascribing the glory to God, the second voice confirms or ratifies these promises. </body></html>
