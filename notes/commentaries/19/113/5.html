They have most reason to praise him; for those who attend him as his servants, know him best, and receive most of his favours, and it is easy, pleasant work to speak well of their Master. God's name ought to be praised in every place, from east to west. Within this wide space the Lord's name is to be praised; it ought to be so, though it is not. Ere long it will be, when all nations shall come and worship before him. God is exalted above all blessing and praise. We must therefore say, with holy admiration, Who is like unto the Lord our God? How condescending in him to behold the things in the earth! And what amazing condescension was it for the Son of God to come from heaven to earth, and take our nature upon him, that he might seek and save those that were lost! How vast his love in taking upon him the nature of man, to ransom guilty souls! God sometimes makes glorious his own wisdom and power, when, having some great work to do, he employs those least likely, and least thought of for it by themselves or others. The apostles were sent from fishing to be fishers of men. And this is God's constant method in his kingdom of grace. He takes men, by nature beggars, and even traitors, to be his favourites, his children, kings and priests unto him; and numbers them with the princes of his chosen people. He gives us all our comforts, which are generally the more welcome when long delayed, and no longer expected. Let us pray that those lands which are yet barren, may speedily become fruitful, and produce many converts to join in praising the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/113.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is like unto the Lord our God? - Who can be compared with Yahweh our God? See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17-25</a>. The meaning is, that no creature - no idol - can be compared with Yahweh. The remark here has special reference to his attributes as immediately specified - his humbling himself to behold the things in heaven and in earth; his raising up the poor, etc. It is true "in general," in regard to God, that no creature can be compared with him; it is true, in regard to each one of his attributes, that they are far above all created excellence.<p>Who dwelleth on high - Margin, "exalteth himself to dwell." Literally, "The one making high to sit." The language is applicable to one who is seated on a lofty throne. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>. He has his dwelling - his throne - his permanent seat - in the heavens: so high and exalted that it requires infinite condescension to look upon the earth, or even upon the heavens. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/113.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6.

Among the gods of the nations, as Kimchi; or among the angels of heaven, or among any of the mighty monarchs on earth; there is none like him for the perfections of his nature, for his wisdom, power, truth, and faithfulness; for his holiness, justice, goodness, grace, and mercy; who is eternal, unchangeable, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent; nor for the works of his hands, his works of creation, providence, and grace; none ever did the like: and what makes this reflection the more delightful to truly good men is, that this God is their God; and all this is true of our Immanuel, God with us; who is God over all, and the only Saviour and Redeemer; and there is none in heaven and earth like him, or to be desired besides him. <p>Who dwelleth on high? in the high and holy place, in the highest heaven, which is his throne; or "who exalteth himself to dwell" (s); so the Targum, <p>"he exalteth his habitation to dwell,'' <p>suitable to the dignity and the greatness of his majesty; as he is high and above all, so he has fixed his habitation in the highest heavens; as he is self-existent, he is self-exalted, and none can exalt him as himself; he is exalted above all blessing and praise; and if it is an exaltation of him to dwell in the highest heavens, what an exaltation will it be of the saints to dwell with him there, in those mansions in his house which Christ is gone to prepare for them! This clause may be applied to Christ, who, both previous to his humiliation, and after it, dwelt in the highest heavens with his Father, in his bosom, from whence he came down on earth, and whither he is gone again, and is highly exalted there. <p>(s)  "sustollens se ad habitandum", Montanus; "qui se elevat", Pagninus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/113.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/113.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is like unto the Lord our God</span>?

Psa 112:1 here also sets forth the theme of that which follows. What is there said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a> concerning the righteousness of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a> here says of the righteousness of him who fears God: this also standeth fast for ever, it is indeed the copy of the divine, it is the work and gift of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a>), inasmuch as God's salutary action and behaviour, laid hold of in faith, works a like form of action and behaviour to it in man, which, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a> says, is, according to its nature, love. The promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a> sounds like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>. Hengstenberg renders: "There ariseth in the darkness light to the upright who is gracious and compassionate and just." But this is impossible as a matter of style. The three adjectives (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4</a>, pointing back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-8.htm">Psalm 145:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-5.htm">Psalm 116:5</a>) are a mention of God according to His attributes. &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; never take the article in Biblical Hebrew, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; follows their examples here (cf. on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>). God Himself is the light which arises in darkness for those who are sincere in their dealings with Him; He is the Sun of righteousness with wings of rays dispensing "grace" and "tender mercies," <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>. The fact that He arises for those who are compassionate as He is compassionate, is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-5.htm">Psalm 112:5</a>. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; being, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>, intended of well-being, prosperity, &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is here equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which is rendered &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488; in Targumic phrase. &#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; signifies, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-26.htm">Psalm 37:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-21.htm">Psalm 37:21</a>, one who charitably dispenses his gifts around. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-5.htm">Psalm 112:5</a> is not an extension of the picture of virtue, but, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>, a promissory prospect: he will uphold in integrity (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-2.htm">Psalm 72:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, and frequently), or rather ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;) in the cause (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>, and frequently), the things which depend upon him, or with which he has to do; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, sustinere, signifies to sustain, i.e., to nourish, to sustain, i.e., endure, and also to support, maintain, i.e., carry through. This is explanatorily confirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-6.htm">Psalm 112:6</a> : he stands, as a general thing, imperturbably fast. And when he dies he becomes the object of everlasting remembrance, his name is still blessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>). Because he has a cheerful conscience, his heart too is not disconcerted by any evil tidings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>): it remains &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, erect, straight and firm, without suffering itself to bend or warp; &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, full of confidence (passive, "in the sense of a passive state after a completed action of the person himself," like &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>); &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, stayed in itself and established. The last two designations are taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>, where it is the church of the last times that is spoken of. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-8.htm">Psalm 91:8</a> gives us information with reference to the meaning of &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;; &#1506;&#1491;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-13.htm">Psalm 94:13</a>, of the inevitable goal, on this side of which he remains undismayed. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-9.htm">2 Corinthians 9:9</a>, where Paul makes use of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a> of the Psalm before us as an encouragement to Christian beneficence, shows how little the assertion "his righteousness standeth for ever" is opposed to the New Testament consciousness. &#1508;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512; of giving away liberally and in manifold ways, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24</a>. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>, stands in opposition to the egoistical &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-5.htm">Psalm 75:5</a> as a vegetative sprouting up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>). The evil-doer must see this, and confounded, vex himself over it; he gnashes his teeth with the rage of envy and chagrin, and melts away, i.e., loses consistency, becomes unhinged, dies off (&#1504;&#1502;&#1505;, 3d praet.

How often has he desired the ruin of him whom he must now see in honour! The tables are turned; this and his ungodly desire in general come to nought, inasmuch as the opposite is realized.
