In the sacred history of the Old Testament, we find many instances of barren women, who were miraculously made to bear children. Isaac, Joseph, Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist were thus born of mothers who had been barren. “These examples,” says Dr. Horne, “may be considered as preludes to that marvellous exertion of divine power, whereby the Gentile Church, after so many years of barrenness, became, in her old age, <span class="ital">a fruitful parent of children, and the mother of us all. </span>Wherefore it is written, <span class="ital">Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear, </span>&c., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm" title="Sing, O barren, you that did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, said the LORD.">Isaiah 54:1</a>.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/113.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>113:1-9 An exhortation to praise God. - God has praise from his own people. They have most reason to praise him; for those who attend him as his servants, know him best, and receive most of his favours, and it is easy, pleasant work to speak well of their Master. God's name ought to be praised in every place, from east to west. Within this wide space the Lord's name is to be praised; it ought to be so, though it is not. Ere long it will be, when all nations shall come and worship before him. God is exalted above all blessing and praise. We must therefore say, with holy admiration, Who is like unto the Lord our God? How condescending in him to behold the things in the earth! And what amazing condescension was it for the Son of God to come from heaven to earth, and take our nature upon him, that he might seek and save those that were lost! How vast his love in taking upon him the nature of man, to ransom guilty souls! God sometimes makes glorious his own wisdom and power, when, having some great work to do, he employs those least likely, and least thought of for it by themselves or others. The apostles were sent from fishing to be fishers of men. And this is God's constant method in his kingdom of grace. He takes men, by nature beggars, and even traitors, to be his favourites, his children, kings and priests unto him; and numbers them with the princes of his chosen people. He gives us all our comforts, which are generally the more welcome when long delayed, and no longer expected. Let us pray that those lands which are yet barren, may speedily become fruitful, and produce many converts to join in praising the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/113.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He maketh the barren woman to keep house ... - Margin, as in Hebrew, "to dwell in a house." That is, to be at the head of a family. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>. This, too, is suggested as a reason why God should be praised and adored. In instances where all hope of posterity is cut off, he interposes, and diffuses joy through a dwelling. We may look abroad, and see abundant occasion for praising God, in his condescension to human affairs - in his lifting up the poor from the humblest condition - in his exalting those of lowly rank to places of honor, trust, wealth, and power; but, after all, if we wish to Find occasions of praise that will most tenderly affect the heart, and be connected with the warmest affections of the soul, they will be most likely to be found in the domestic circle - in the mutual love - the common joy - the tender feelings - which bind together the members of a family. In such a family, the words with which this psalm begins and ends, "Hallelujah," "Hallelujah," are especially appropriate; and if any community on earth should apply these words to itself it should be such a family, called upon by everything tender, holy, and lovely, to "praise the" Lord. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/113.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

And so it is explained in the next clause. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/113.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He maketh the barren woman to keep house,.... Or "to dwell in the house", as the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and other versions; or rather "to cause the house to be inhabited"; to fill the house with inhabitants, to build up the house, as the barren woman, when made fruitful, does, as Rachel and Leah built up the house of Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>. This may be applied to the church of God, as it is to the congregation of Israel by the Targum, <p>"who makes the congregation of Israel, which is like to a barren woman, that sitteth sorrowful, to dwell with the men of her house, full of multitudes.'' <p>Jarchi interprets it of Zion, who was as a barren woman; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-27.htm">Galatians 4:27</a>. It may be illustrated by the case of the primitive and apostolic church, which at first had but very few converts, but afterwards, both in Judea and in the Gentile world, had large numbers; as the church in the latter day will also have, when the fulness of the Gentiles is brought in, and the nation of the Jews born at once. <p>And to be a joyful mother of children; as the barren woman is when she becomes the mother of children; and indeed every woman rejoices when a man is born into the world, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>, and so does the church of Christ and people of God, when souls are born again among them; this causes great joy among the saints; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>. <p>Praise ye the Lord; not only for the church's fruitfulness, but for all the great and good things the Lord has vouchsafed to do for his people, mentioned in this psalm. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/113.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children.

But doubtless under the figure of the once childless wife gladdened with a family of sons the Psalmist intends to allude to Zion. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm" title="Sing, O barren, you that did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, said the LORD.">Isaiah 54:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-8.htm" title="Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.">Isaiah 66:8</a>. So the Targum: “Who maketh the congregation of Israel, which was like a barren woman mourning for the men of her household, to be full of crowds, like a mother who rejoiceth over sons.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Praise ye the Lord</span>] In the LXX this Hallelujah is transferred, perhaps rightly, to the beginning of Psalms 114.

Hannah's song is still in the psalmist's thoughts, and suggests this illustration (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>). But it must not be restricted to a literal interpretation. The true "barren woman" was Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>), whose curse of barrenness was ultimately removed, and who became, as here prophesied, <span class="cmt_word">a joyful mother of children</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-12.htm">Isaiah 49:12, 18, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-27.htm">Galatians 4:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Praise ye the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104, 105, 106, 115, 116, 117, 135, 146-150</a>, which terminate similarly). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/113.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The call, not limited by any addition as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>, or eve, after the manner of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>., extended over the earth, is given to the whole of the true Israel that corresponds to its election by grace and is faithful to its mission; and its designation by "servants of Jahve" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-37.htm">Psalm 69:37</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-23.htm">Psalm 34:23</a>), or even "servant of Jahve" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-22.htm">Psalm 136:22</a>), has come into vogue more especially through the second part of Isaiah. This Israel is called upon to praise Jahve; for the praise and celebration of His Name, i.e., of His nature, which is disclosed by means of its manifestation, is a principal element, yea, the proper ground and aim, of the service, and shall finally become that which fills all time and all space. &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; laudatum (est), is equivalent to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, laudabile (lxx, Vulgate), and this does not differ greatly from laudetur.
