How unrighteous soever men were, the Lord was righteous in permitting them to do what they did. Deliverances from trouble are mercies indeed, when grounded upon the pardon of sin; we should therefore be more earnest in prayer for the removal of our sins than for the removal of afflictions. They had no hopes but from God's mercies, his tender mercies. They plead no merit, they pretend to none, but, Help us for the glory of thy name; pardon us for thy name's sake. The Christian forgets not that he is often bound in the chain of his sins. The world to him is a prison; sentence of death is passed upon him, and he knows not how soon it may be executed. How fervently should he at all times pray, O let the sighing of a prisoner come before thee, according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die! How glorious will the day be, when, triumphant over sin and sorrow, the church beholds the adversary disarmed for ever! while that church shall, from age to age, sing the praises of her great Shepherd and Bishop, her King and her God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/79.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For they have devoured Jacob - literally, "They have eaten."

The posterity of Jacob, the people of the Jews, typical of the church of God, made havoc of by the Romish antichrist: and laid waste his dwelling place; both Jerusalem and the temple, which was done both by the Chaldeans and the Romans, and also in the times of Antiochus; see the Apocrypha: <p>"38 Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them: whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers, and became strange to those that were born in her; and her own children left her. 39 Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach her honour into contempt.'' (1 Maccabees 1) <p>"4 In his acts he was like a lion, and like a lion's whelp roaring for his prey. 5 For He pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt up those that vexed his people.''

At first sight it would appear that the prophecy must be earlier than the Fall of Jerusalem, and that the Psalmist must be quoting from the prophet. But ch. 10 in its present form can hardly be from the pen of Jeremiah himself: <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/10-1.htm" title="Hear you the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel:...">Jeremiah 10:1-10</a></span> at any rate can hardly be his: and <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/10-23.htm" title="O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walks to direct his steps....">Jeremiah 10:23-25</a></span> appear to be a composite passage. The insertion of ‘yea, they have devoured him and consumed him’ after ‘Jacob,’ looks like the transformation of poetry into prose, and it is possible that the Psalm is the original.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/79.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</span> This and the preceding verso occur also, almost word for word, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>.
