How unrighteous soever men were, the Lord was righteous in permitting them to do what they did. Deliverances from trouble are mercies indeed, when grounded upon the pardon of sin; we should therefore be more earnest in prayer for the removal of our sins than for the removal of afflictions. They had no hopes but from God's mercies, his tender mercies. They plead no merit, they pretend to none, but, Help us for the glory of thy name; pardon us for thy name's sake. The Christian forgets not that he is often bound in the chain of his sins. The world to him is a prison; sentence of death is passed upon him, and he knows not how soon it may be executed. How fervently should he at all times pray, O let the sighing of a prisoner come before thee, according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die! How glorious will the day be, when, triumphant over sin and sorrow, the church beholds the adversary disarmed for ever! while that church shall, from age to age, sing the praises of her great Shepherd and Bishop, her King and her God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/79.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee - The sighing of him who is bound. The allusion here is, doubtless, to those among the Hebrews who had been taken captives, and who "sighed" not only on account of the sufferings which they endured in their bondage, but because they had been taken from their country and home. The meaning is, "Hear those sighs, and come for the deliverance of those who are thus held in captivity."<p>According to the greatness of thy power - Margin, as in Hebrew, thine arm. The arm is the symbol of power. It is implied here that great power was needful to deliver those who were held in captivity, power such as God only could exert - power which could be wielded only by an Omnipotent Being. It was the power of God only which could rescue them, as it is only by the power of God that sinners can be saved.<p>Preserve thou those that are appointed to die - Margin, Reserve the children of death. The literal meaning is, "Let remain the sons of death;" that is, Preserve those who are in such circumstances that death is impending, and who may be called the sons of death. This might apply to those who were condemned to death; or, to those who were sick and in danger of death; or to those who were prisoners and captives, and who were, by their sufferings, exposed to death. The prayer is that such might be suffered to remain on the earth; that is, that they might be kept alive. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/79.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. prisoner&#8212;the whole captive people.<p>power&#8212;literally, "arm" (Ps 10:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/79.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of the prisoner; </span> of thy poor people now in prison, or, at least, in captivity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Those that are appointed to die, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the children of death</span>, i.e. which were either designed to death, or in manifest danger of it, as being wholly in the power of their cruel and barbarous enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/79.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee,....

It is not necessary to understand these expressions literally of prisoners sentenced to execution: more probably they denote the prison and the living death of exile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm" title="To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.">Isaiah 42:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-9.htm" title="That you may say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves.

The Babylonians treated their Jewish captives variously. Some, like Daniel and the "Three Children," were favoured, and exalted to high places. But the bulk of them were afflicted and oppressed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-3.htm">Lamentations 1:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-18.htm">Lamentations 5:18</a>, etc.).

The phrase recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-20.htm">Psalm 102:20</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/79.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Out of the plaintive question how long? and whether endlessly God would be angry and cause His jealousy to continue to burn like a fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>), grows up the prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm">Psalm 79:6</a>) that He would turn His anger against the heathen who are estranged from the hostile towards Him, and of whom He is now making use as a rod of anger against His people. The taking over of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm">Psalm 79:6-7</a> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a> is not betrayed by the looseness of the connection of thought; but in themselves these four lines sound much more original in Jeremiah, and the style is exactly that of this prophet, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-3.htm">Jeremiah 2:3</a>, and frequently, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-20.htm">Psalm 49:20</a>. The &#1488;&#1500;, instead of &#1506;&#1500;, which follows &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; is incorrect; the singular &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; gathers all up as in one mass, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>. The fact that such power over Israel is given to the heathen world has its ground in the sins of Israel. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a> it may be inferred that the apostasy which raged earlier is now checked. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is not an adjective (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-28.htm">Job 31:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>), which would have been expressed by &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1495;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, but a genitive: the iniquities of the forefathers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1-13</a>). On <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-6.htm">Judges 6:6</a>. As is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-9.htm">Psalm 79:9</a>, the poet does not mean that the present generation, itself guiltless, has to expiate the guilt of the fathers (on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>); he prays as one of those who have turned away from the sins of the fathers, and who can now no longer consider themselves as placed under wrath, but under sin-pardoning and redeeming grace. </body></html>
