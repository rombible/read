How unrighteous soever men were, the Lord was righteous in permitting them to do what they did. Deliverances from trouble are mercies indeed, when grounded upon the pardon of sin; we should therefore be more earnest in prayer for the removal of our sins than for the removal of afflictions. They had no hopes but from God's mercies, his tender mercies. They plead no merit, they pretend to none, but, Help us for the glory of thy name; pardon us for thy name's sake. The Christian forgets not that he is often bound in the chain of his sins. The world to him is a prison; sentence of death is passed upon him, and he knows not how soon it may be executed. How fervently should he at all times pray, O let the sighing of a prisoner come before thee, according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die! How glorious will the day be, when, triumphant over sin and sorrow, the church beholds the adversary disarmed for ever! while that church shall, from age to age, sing the praises of her great Shepherd and Bishop, her King and her God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/79.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And render unto our neighbors - That is, the neighbors who had reproached them; the surrounding people who had seen these calamities come upon them, and who had regarded these calamities as proof that their God was unable to protect them, or that they were suffering under his displeasure.

The &#1488;&#1500;, instead of &#1506;&#1500;, which follows &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; is incorrect; the singular &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; gathers all up as in one mass, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>. The fact that such power over Israel is given to the heathen world has its ground in the sins of Israel. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a> it may be inferred that the apostasy which raged earlier is now checked. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is not an adjective (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-28.htm">Job 31:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>), which would have been expressed by &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1495;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, but a genitive: the iniquities of the forefathers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1-13</a>).

As is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-9.htm">Psalm 79:9</a>, the poet does not mean that the present generation, itself guiltless, has to expiate the guilt of the fathers (on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>); he prays as one of those who have turned away from the sins of the fathers, and who can now no longer consider themselves as placed under wrath, but under sin-pardoning and redeeming grace. </body></html>
