God calls us by his Spirit, by his word, by his worship, and by special providences, merciful and afflicting. When we are foolishly making court to lying vanities, God is, in love to us, calling us to seek our own mercies in him. The call is general, Seek ye my face; but we must apply it to ourselves, I will seek it. The word does us no good, when we do not ourselves accept the exhortation: a gracious heart readily answers to the call of a gracious God, being made willing in the day of his power. The psalmist requests the favour of the Lord; the continuance of his presence with him; the benefit of Divine guidance, and the benefit of Divine protection. God's time to help those that trust in him, is, when all other helpers fail. He is a surer and better Friend than earthly parents are, or can be. What was the belief which supported the psalmist? That he should see the goodness of the Lord. There is nothing like the believing hope of eternal life, the foresights of that glory, and foretastes of those pleasures, to keep us from fainting under all calamities. In the mean time he should be strengthened to bear up under his burdens. Let us look unto the suffering Saviour, and pray in faith, not to be delivered into the hands of our enemies. Let us encourage each other to wait on the Lord, with patient expectation, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hide not thy face far from me - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>. To "hide the face" is to turn it away with displeasure, as if we would not look on one who has offended us. The favor of God is often expressed by "lifting the light of his countenance" upon anyone - looking complacently or "pleasedly" upon him. The reverse of this is expressed by hiding the face, or by turning it away. The word "far" introduced by the translators does not aid the sense of the passage.<p>Put not thy servant away in anger - Do not turn me off, or put me away in displeasure. We turn one away, or do not admit him into our presence, with whom we are displeased. The psalmist prayed that he might have free access to God as a Friend.<p>Thou hast been my help - In days that are past. This he urges as a reason why God should still befriend him. The fact that He had shown mercy to him, that He had treated him as a friend, is urged as a reason why He should now hear his prayers, and show him mercy.<p>Leave me not - Do not abandon me. This is still a proper ground of pleading with God. We may refer to all His former mercies toward us; we may make mention of those mercies as a reason why He should now interpose and save us. We may, so to speak, "remind" him of His former favors and friendship, and may plead with Him that He will complete what He has begun, and that, having once admitted us to His favor, He will never leave or forsake us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Yea, not at all from him; for the word "far" is not in the text: this is sometimes the case of the best of men, and was of the psalmist at times, and might be now, notwithstanding his strong expressions of faith and joy in the preceding verses; for frames are very changeable things; and this case is consistent with the everlasting and unchangeable love of God to his people; though they are ready to impute it to wrath and anger, and is what is very cutting and grievous to them; and therefore deprecate it as the psalmist does here, <p>put not thy servant away in anger; either cast him not away from thy presence, as being angry with him, though there is just reason for it; or suffer him not to go away angry, fretting and murmuring: he makes mention of his relation to God as a servant, as he was; not only by creation as a man, and by his office as a king, but by efficacious grace as a converted man; and this only as descriptive of himself, and as acknowledging his dependence on the Lord, and his obligation to him; but not as a reason why he should be regarded by him, for he knew he was but an unprofitable servant; <p>thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me: which request, as the rest, he might put up in faith; for God will not leave his people destitute of his presence finally and totally; nor to themselves and the corruptions of their hearts, nor to the temptations of Satan; nor will he forsake the work of his hands, the work of grace upon their hearts; or so forsake them as that they shall perish: and that the Lord would not leave nor forsake him in such sense, the psalmist had reason to conclude; since he had been his help in times past, a present help in time of trouble; and his arm was not shortened, his power was the same to help as ever, and so were his inclination and will; since he could also call unto him, and upon him, as follows: <p>O God of my salvation; the author both of his temporal, spiritual, and eternal salvation; and what might he not hope for from him? salvation includes all blessings, both for soul and body, for time and eternity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>.

David felt from time to time as if God's face was hidden from him, as we see in other psalms  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-17.htm">Psalm 69:17</a>, etc.); and so also did other saints (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-14.htm">Psalm 88:14</a>).

It is a hexastich in the caesural schema. Let darkness break in upon him, the darkness of night, of trouble, and of spiritual conflict, yet Jahve is his Light, and if he is in Him, he is in the light and there shines upon him a sun, that sets not and knows no eclipse. This sublime, infinitely profound name for God, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, is found only in this passage; and there is only one other expression that can be compared with it. viz., &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>; cf. &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497; does not stand beside &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; as an unfigurative, side by side with a figurative expression; for the statement that God is light, is not a metaphor. David calls Him his "salvation" in regard to everything that oppresses him, and the "stronghold (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; from &#1506;&#1494;&#1494;, with an unchangeable ) of his life" in regard to everything that exposes him to peril. In Jahve he conquers far and wide; in Him his life is hidden as it were behind a fortress built upon a rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>). When to the wicked who come upon him in a hostile way (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500; differing from &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;), he attributes the intention of devouring his flesh, they are conceived of as wild beasts. To eat up any one's flesh signifies, even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a>, the same as to pursue any one by evil speaking (in Aramaic by slander, back-biting) to his destruction. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; (the Sheb&#1490; of the only faintly closed syllable is raised to a Chateph, as in &#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>, &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, and the like. The &#1500;&#1497; of &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; may, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>), be regarded as giving intensity to the notion of special, personal enmity; but a mere repetition of the subject (the enemy) without the repetition of their hostile purpose would be tame in the parallel member of the verse: &#1500;&#1497; is a variation of the preceding &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-60.htm">Lamentations 3:60</a>. In the apodosis &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, the overthrow of the enemy is regarded beforehand as an accomplished fact. The holy boldness and imperturbable repose are expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a> in the very rhythm. The thesis or downward movement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a> is spondaic: he does not allow himself to be disturbed; the thesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a> is iambic: he can be bold. The rendering of Hitzig (as of Rashi): "in this do I trust, viz., that Jahve is my light, etc.," is erroneous. Such might be the interpretation, if &#1489;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1493;&#1496;&#1495; closed <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>; but it cannot refer back over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; and why should the poet have expressed himself thus materially, instead of saying &#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;? The fact of the case is this, &#1489;&#1493;&#1496;&#1495; signifies even by itself "of good courage," e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>; and &#1489;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; "in spite of this" (Coccejus: hoc non obstante), <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-27.htm">Leviticus 26:27</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a>, begins the apodosis, at the head of which we expect to find an adversative conjunction. </body></html>
