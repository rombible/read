Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">יהוה</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">קוה אל</span>, <span class="ital">kavveh eel Jehovah, look to, </span>or <span class="ital">hope for, </span>or <span class="ital">expect, the Lord. Be of good courage — </span>Keep up thy spirits in the midst of thy greatest dangers and difficulties: let thy heart be fixed, trusting in God, and thy mind stayed on him, and then none of these things will move thee; <span class="ital">wait, I say, on the Lord — </span>Whatever thou doest, grow not remiss or careless in thy attendance upon God, but keep close to him and thy duty. “The psalmist here,” says Dr. Dodd, after Bishop Patrick, “admonishes any person who shall fall into such straits as his, to learn by his example not to be impatient, or to despond presently, much less to despair of relief, if God do not send it just when it is expected. There is no misery so strong and grievous, no devotion so fervent and powerful, as can bring God to article for the time of deliverance; if we will not wait, he will not come. It may be one of the greatest ends for which the affliction we labour under is applied to us, to reform and reduce us, and root out the passion and impatience of our nature; and God is too good a physician to remove the medicine before it hath wrought its effect, or to put us out of his hand before he hath cured us. Indeed, he hath greater reason to teach us this lesson thoroughly, since when he hath given us the deliverance we pray for, and all that we can desire in this life, there is still somewhat more, and of more value than that which he hath given us, which we must wait for:” we must wait “till the few and evil days of our pilgrimage pass away, and we arrive at the mansions prepared for us in the house of our heavenly Father; till our warfare be accomplished, and terminate in the peace of God; till the storms and tempests of wintry time shall give place to the unclouded calm and the ever-blooming pleasures of eternal spring.” — Horne. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:7-14 Wherever the believer is, he can find a way to the throne of grace by prayer. God calls us by his Spirit, by his word, by his worship, and by special providences, merciful and afflicting. When we are foolishly making court to lying vanities, God is, in love to us, calling us to seek our own mercies in him. The call is general, Seek ye my face; but we must apply it to ourselves, I will seek it. The word does us no good, when we do not ourselves accept the exhortation: a gracious heart readily answers to the call of a gracious God, being made willing in the day of his power. The psalmist requests the favour of the Lord; the continuance of his presence with him; the benefit of Divine guidance, and the benefit of Divine protection. God's time to help those that trust in him, is, when all other helpers fail. He is a surer and better Friend than earthly parents are, or can be. What was the belief which supported the psalmist? That he should see the goodness of the Lord. There is nothing like the believing hope of eternal life, the foresights of that glory, and foretastes of those pleasures, to keep us from fainting under all calamities. In the mean time he should be strengthened to bear up under his burdens. Let us look unto the suffering Saviour, and pray in faith, not to be delivered into the hands of our enemies. Let us encourage each other to wait on the Lord, with patient expectation, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wait on the Lord - This is the sum of all the instruction in the psalm; the main lesson which the psalm is designed to convey. The object is to induce others, from the experience of the psalmist, to trust in the Lord; to rely upon Him; to come to Him in trouble and danger; to wait for His interposition when all other resources fail. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>.<p>Be of good courage - The Hebrew word here means, "be strong." That is, do not faint. Do not be dismayed. Still hope and trust in the Lord.<p>He shall strengthen thine heart - He will strengthen "thee." He will enable you to perform your duties, and to triumph over your enemies. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>.<p>Wait, I say, on the Lord - Repeating an idea with which the heart was full; a lesson resulting from his own rich experience. He dwells upon it as a lesson which he would fix deeply in the mind, that in all times of danger and difficulty, instead of despondency, instead of sinking down in despair, instead of giving up all effort, we should go forward in the discharge of duty, putting our trust solely in the Lord. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

The last clause is, literally, "and wait," &c., as if expecting new measures of help.   <a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/27.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>14 Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.<p>"Wait on the Lord." Wait at his door with prayer; wait at his foot with humility; wait at his table with service; wait at his window with expectancy. Suitors often win nothing but the cold shoulder from earthly patrons after long and obsequious waiting; he speeds best whose patron is in the skies. "Be of good courage." A soldier's motto. Be it mine. Courage we shall need, and for the exercise of it we have as much reason as necessity, if we are soldiers of King Jesus. "And he shall strengthen thine heart." He can lay the plaister right upon the weak place. Let the heart be strengthened, and the whole machine of humanity is filled with power; a strong heart makes a strong arm. What strength is this which God himself gives to the heart? Read the "Book of Martyrs," and see its glorious deeds of prowess; go to God rather, and get such power thyself. "Wait, I say, on the Lord." David, in the words "I say," sets his own private seal to the word which, as an inspired man, he had been moved to write. It is his testimony as well as the command of God, and indeed he who writes these scanty notes has himself found it so sweet, so reviving, so profitable to draw near to God, that on his own account he also feels bound to write, "Wait, I say, on the Lord." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wait on the Lord, </span> O my soul; to which he now turneth his speech; as he frequently doth in this book. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He shall strengthen thine heart; </span> he will uphold thee, and keep thee from fainting and sinking under thy burdens. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wait on the Lord,.... This, with what follows, is spoken by the psalmist either to himself or to others, or it may be to both, upon the rich experience he declares in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, it becomes believers to wait on the Lord for the common blessings of life, for even the eyes of all wait upon him for their daily food; and for the light of his countenance, when it is withdrawn from them, for he will return again at the set time; and for answers of prayer, which will be given sooner or later; and for the performance of his promises, which are yea and amen in Christ: they should wait upon him in his house and ordinances constantly, with reverence and godly fear; they should wait upon him as servants on their masters, observe his orders, and diligently execute them; and, as beggars for their alms, they should knock and wait at Wisdom's gates, tell their case and wait, take repulses and wait, and, when they succeed, give thanks. It is good to wait upon the Lord; many are the favours and blessings such receive now, and eye has not seen what God has prepared for them that wait for him; <p>be of good courage; the saints have need of courage, considering the enemies they have to grapple with; the corruptions of their own hearts, the enemies of a man's own house; the worst of all, Satan, and his principalities and powers; and men of the world, and a world of them: and they have great reason, notwithstanding, be of good courage, since God is for them; Christ is the Captain of their salvation; the Holy Spirit, that is in them, is greater than he that is in the world; angels encamp around them; they are provided with the whole armour of God; they are engaged in a good cause, are sure of victory, and shall wear the crown of righteousness; and it follows, <p>and he shall strengthen thine heart; that is, the Lord will do it, as he has promised to them that wait on him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>; or "let thine heart be strengthened": as the Septuagint render it; and so the Chaldee paraphrase, "strengthen thine heart"; taking it for an exhortation; as indeed it seems to be by what goes before and follows; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>; <p>wait, I say, on the Lord; this is repeated, to express the importance of this duty, and to encourage to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{i}</span> Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.</span><p>(i) He exhorts himself to depend on the Lord seeing he never failed in his promises.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

But in this Psalm the prayer is only just beginning at this stage. The transition is brought about by the preceding conception of the danger that threatens him from the side of his foes who are round about him. The reality, which, in the first part, is overcome and surmounted by his faith, makes itself consciously felt here. It is not to be rendered, as has been done by the Vulgate, Exaudi Domine vocem qua clamavi (rather, clamo) ad te (the introit of the Dominica exspectationis in the interval of preparation between Ascension and Pentecost). &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; has Dech&#1502;, and accordingly &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, voce mea (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>) clamo, is an adverbial clause equivalent to voce mea clamante me. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a> &#1500;&#1498; cannot possibly be so rendered that &#1500; is treated as Lamed auctoris (Dathe, Olshausen): Thine, saith my heart, is (the utterance:) seek ye may face. The declaration is opposed to this sense, thus artificially put upon it. &#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; are undoubtedly to be construed together; and what the heart says to Jahve is not: Seek ye my face, but by reason of this, and as its echo (Calvin: velut Deo succinens): I will therefore seek Thy face. Just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>, a personal inference is drawn from a directly quoted saying of God. In the periodic style it would be necessary to transpose &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; thus: since Thou hast permitted and exhorted us, or in accordance with Thy persuasive invitation, that we should seek Thy face, I do seek Thy face (Hupfeld). There is no retrospective reference to any particular passage in the T&#1508;ra, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>. The prayer is not based upon any single passage of Scripture, but upon God's commands and promises in general. </body></html>
