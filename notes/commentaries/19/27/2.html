In God let us strengthen ourselves. The gracious presence of God, his power, his promise, his readiness to hear prayer, the witness of his Spirit in the hearts of his people; these are the secret of his tabernacle, and in these the saints find cause for that holy security and peace of mind in which they dwell at ease. The psalmist prays for constant communion with God in holy ordinances. All God's children desire to dwell in their Father's house. Not to sojourn there as a wayfaring man, to tarry but for a night; or to dwell there for a time only, as the servant that abides not in the house for ever; but to dwell there all the days of their life, as children with a father. Do we hope that the praising of God will be the blessedness of our eternity? Surely then we ought to make it the business of our time. This he had at heart more than any thing. Whatever the Christian is as to this life, he considers the favour and service of God as the one thing needful. This he desires, prays for and seeks after, and in it he rejoices.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me - This refers, doubtless, to some particular period of his past life when he was in very great danger, and when God interposed to save him. The margin here is, "approached against me." The literal rendering would be, "in the drawing near against me of the wicked to eat up my flesh." The reference is to some period when they purposed an attack upon him, and when he was in imminent danger from such a threatened attack.<p>To eat up my flesh - As if they would eat me up. That is, they came upon me like ravening wolves, or hungry lions. We are not to suppose that they literally purposed to eat up his flesh, or that they were cannibals; but the comparison is one that is drawn from the fierceness of wild beasts rushing on their prey. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>.<p>They stumbled and fell - They were overthrown. They failed in their purpose. Either they were thrown into a panic by a false fear, or they were overthrown in battle. The language would be rather applicable to the former, as if by some alarm they were thrown into consternation. Either they differed among themselves and became confused, or God threw obstacles in their way and they were driven back. The general idea is, that God had interposed in some way to prevent the execution of their purposes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. eat &#8230; my flesh&#8212;(Job 19:22; Ps 14:4).

They are wicked men, men of malignant spirits, and evildoers, who are the enemies and foes of the people of God, and who hate them with an implacable hatred, and do everything they can to distress and afflict them; and such enemies David had, who were many and mighty; and these "came upon" him, or "approached against" him (c), they drew near to him to make war with him, as the word signifies (d); they attacked him in an hostile manner; and their view was, as he says, <p>to eat up my flesh, as they eat bread, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>; to devour him at once, to make but one morsel of him, to destroy his life, to strip him of his substance, to take away his wives and children, as the Amalekites at Ziklag, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>; <p>they stumbled and fell; the Lord put stumbling blocks in their way, and retarded their march, and hindered them from executing their designs; and they fell into the hands of David, and were subdued under him, or fell by death; and these past instances of divine goodness the psalmist calls to mind, to keep up his heart and courage, and animate and strengthen him against the fears of men, of death and hell. <p>(c)  "cum appropinquaverint adversum me", Pagninus; so Gejerus.

And, in general, the expression of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>. takes a priestly form, without exceeding that which the ritual admits of, by virtue of the consciousness of being themselves priests which appertained even to the Israelitish laity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>).

In the expression "all Thy wondrous works" is included the latest of these, to which the voice of thanksgiving especially refers, viz., the bringing of him home from the exile he had suffered from Absolom. Longing to be back again he longs most of all for the gorgeous services in the house of his God, which are performed around the altar of the outer court; for he loves the habitation of the house of God, the place, where His doxa, - revealed on earth, and in fact revealed in grace, - has taken up its abode. ma`own does not mean refuge, shelter (Hupfeld), - for although it may obtain this meaning from the context, it has nothing whatever to do with Arab. &#8219;a&#770;n, med. Waw, in the signification to help (whence ma&#8219;u&#770;n, ma&#8219;u&#770;ne, ma&#8219;a&#770;ne, help, assistance, succour or support), - but place, dwelling, habitation, like the Arabic ma&#8219;a&#770;n, which the Kamus explains by menzil, a place to settle down in, and explains etymologically by Arab. mh&#803;ll 'l-&#8219;&#305;&#770;n, i.e., "a spot on which the eye rests as an object of sight;" for in the Arabic ma&#8219;a&#770;n is traced back to Arab. &#8219;a&#770;n, med. Je, as is seen from the phrase hum minka bi-ma&#8219;a&#770;nin, i.e., they are from thee on a point of sight ( equals  on a spot where thou canst see them from the spot on which thou standest). The signification place, sojourn, abode (Targ. &#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;) is undoubted; the primary meaning of the root is, however, questionable. </body></html>
