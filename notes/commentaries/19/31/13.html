Herein he was a type of Christ, who was acquainted with grief. David acknowledged that his afflictions were merited by his own sins, but Christ suffered for ours. David's friends durst not give him any assistance. Let us not think it strange if thus deserted, but make sure of a Friend in heaven who will not fail. God will be sure to order and dispose all for the best, to all those who commit their spirits also into his hand. The time of life is in God's hands, to lengthen or shorten, make bitter or sweet, according to the counsel of his will. The way of man is not in himself, nor in our friend's hands, nor in our enemies' hands, but in God's. In this faith and confidence he prays that the Lord would save him for his mercies's sake, and not for any merit of his own. He prophesies the silencing of those that reproach and speak evil of the people of God. There is a day coming, when the Lord will execute judgment upon them. In the mean time, we should engage ourselves by well-doing, if possible, to silence the ignorance of foolish men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I have heard the slander of many - The reproach; the false accusations; the unjust aspersions. We are here more definitely informed as to another of the sources of the trouble that came upon him. It was "slander." He had already referred to "two" sources of trouble; one <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a> that he was "reproached" by his friends and neighbors, and that his society was shunned by them; a second, that he was "forgotten" by those who ought to have remembered him, and that they treated him as though he were dead, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>. The third is referred to now; to wit, that he was the subject of "slander," or of false reports. What was the "nature" of those false charges we are not informed. But it is not needful that we should know precisely what they were. It is enough, in order to see the depth and aggravation of his trouble, to know that he "was" exposed to this; and that, to all that he had to endure from other sources, there was this added - that his name was reproached and cast out as evil - that he was subjected to "slander,"<p>"Whose edge is sharper than the sword; whose tongue<p>Outvenoms all the worms of Nile; whose breath<p>Rides on the posting winds; and doth belie<p>All corners of the world."<p>Cymbeline, Act iii., Sc. iv.<p>Fear was on every side - From the causes already specified.

Out of his confident security in God (&#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;) springs the prayer: may it never come to this with me, that I am put to confusion by the disappointment of my hope. This prayer in the form of intense desire is followed by prayers in the direct form of supplication. The supplicatory &#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497; is based upon God's righteousness, which cannot refrain from repaying conduct consistent with the order of redemption, though after prolonged trial, with the longed for tokens of deliverance. In the second paragraph, the prayer is moulded in accordance with the circumstances of him who is chased by Saul hither and thither among the mountains and in the desert, homeless and defenceless. In the expression &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; is genit. appositionis: a rock of defence (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; from &#1506;&#1494;&#1494;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>), or rather: of refuge (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;  equals  Arab. m&#8219;a&#770;d, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1494;  equals  Arab. 'a&#770;d, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-39.htm">Psalm 37:39</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-9.htm">Psalm 52:9</a>, and probably also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a> and elsewhere);<p>(Note: It can hardly be doubted, that, in opposition to the pointing as we have it, which only recognises one &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; (&#1502;&#1506;&#1494;) from &#1506;&#1494;&#1494;, to be strong, there are two different substantives having this principal form, viz., &#1502;&#1506;&#1494; a fortress, secure place, bulwark, which according to its derivation is inflected &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;, etc., and &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; equivalent to the Arabic ma&#8219;a&#770;dh, a hiding-place, defence, refuge, which ought to have been declined &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;&#1497; or &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1497; like the synonymous &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497; (Olshausen 201, 202). Moreover &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, Arab. 'a&#770;d, like &#1495;&#1505;&#1492;, of which it is the parallel word in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>, means to hide one's self anywhere (Piel and Hiph., Hebrew &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1494;, according to the Kamus, Zamachshari and Neshwn: to hide any one, e.g., Koran 3:31); hence Arab. 'a&#770;&#8219;d, a plant that grows among bushes (be&#770;n esh-sho&#770;k according to the Kamus) or in the crevices of the rocks (fi-l-hazn according to Neshwn) and is thus inaccessible to the herds; Arab. 'wwad, gazelles that are invisible, i.e., keep hidden, for seven days after giving birth, also used of pieces of flesh of which part is hidden among the bones; Arab. 'u&#770;dat, an amulet with which a man covers himself (protegit), and so forth. - Wetzstein.<p>Consequently &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; (formed like Arab. m&#8219;a&#770;d, according to Neshwn equivalent to Arab. ma'wad) is prop. a place in which to hide one's self, synonymous with &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;, Arab. mla&#770;d, malja&#8219;, and the like. True, the two substantives from &#1506;&#1494;&#1494; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1494; meet in their meanings like praesidium and asylum, and according to passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a> appear to be blended in the genius of the language, but they are radically distinct.)<p>a rock-castle, i.e., a castle upon a rock, would be called &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, reversing the order of the words. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-3.htm">Psalm 71:3</a>, a rock of habitation, i.e., of safe sojourn, fully warrants this interpretation. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, prop. specula, signifies a mountain height or the summit of a mountain; a house on the mountain height is one that is situated on some high mountain top and affords a safe asylum (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>). The thought "show me Thy salvation, for Thou art my Saviour," underlies the connection expressed by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a>. Lster considers it to be illogical, but it is the logic of every believing prayer. The poet prays that God would become to him, actu reflexo, that which to the actus directus of his faith He is even now. The futures in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a> express hopes which necessarily arise out of that which Jahve is to the poet. The interchangeable notions &#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;, with which we are familiar from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-6</a>, stand side by side, in order to give urgency to the utterance of the longing for God's gentle and safe guidance. Instead of translating it "out of the net, which etc.," according to the accents (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a>) it should be rendered "out of the net there," so that &#1496;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; is a relative clause without the relative.<p>Into the hand of this God, who is and will be all this to him, he commends his spirit; he gives it over into His hand as a trust or deposit (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;); for whatsoever is deposited there is safely kept, and freed from all danger and all distress. The word used is not &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, which Theodotion substitutes when he renders it &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; but &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;; and this is used designedly. The language of the prayer lays hold of life at its root, as springing directly from God and as also living in the believer from God and in God; and this life it places under His protection, who is the true life of all spirit-life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>) and of all life. It is the language of prayer with which the dying Christ breathed forth His life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>. The period of David's persecution by Saul is the most prolific in types of the Passion; and this language of prayer, which proceeded from the furnace of affliction through which David at that time passed, denotes, in the mouth of Christ a crisis in the history of redemption in which the Old Testament receives its fulfilment. Like David, He commends His spirit to God; but not, that He may not die, but that dying He may not die, i.e., that He may receive back again His spirit-corporeal life, which is hidden in the hand of God, in imperishable power and glory. That which is so ardently desired and hoped for is regarded by him, who thus in faith commends himself to God, as having already taken place, "Thou hast redeemed me, Jahve, God of truth." The perfect &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; is not used here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>, of that which is past, but of that which is already as good as past; it is not precative (Ew. 223, b), but, like the perfects in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a>, an expression of believing anticipation of redemption. It is the praet. confidentiae which is closely related to the praet. prophet.; for the spirit of faith, like the spirit of the prophets, speaks of the future with historic certainty. In the notion of &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; it is impossible to exclude the reference to false gods which is contained in &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>, since, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>, "vain illusions" are used as an antithesis. &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, ever since <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, has become a favourite name for idols, and more particularly in Jeremiah (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1-9</a> :19). On the other hand, according to the context, it may also not differ very greatly from &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; since the idea of God as a depositary or trustee still influences the thought, and &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; and &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; are used interchangeably in other passages as personal attributes. We may say that &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; is being that lasts and verifies itself, and &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; is sentiment that lasts and verifies itself. Therefore &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; is the God, who as the true God, maintains the truth of His revelation, and more especially of His promises, by a living authority or rule.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>, David appeals to his entire and simple surrender to this true and faithful God: hateful to him are those, who worship vain images, whilst he, on the other hand, cleaves to Jahve. It is the false gods, which are called &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, as beings without being, which are of no service to their worshippers and only disappoint their expectations. Probably (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-6.htm">Psalm 5:6</a>) it is to be read &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514; with the lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions (Hitzig, Ewald, Olshausen, and others). In the text before us, which gives us no corrective Ker as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-21.htm">2 Samuel 14:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-5.htm">Ruth 4:5</a>, &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is not an antithesis to the preceding clause, but to the member of that clause which immediately precedes it. In Jonah's psalm, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, this is expressed by &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;; in the present instance the Kal is used in the signification observare, colere, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a>, and even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18</a>. In the waiting of service is included, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>, the waiting of trust. The word &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; which denotes the fiducia fidei is usually construed with &#1489;&#1468; of adhering to, or &#1506;&#1500; of resting upon; but here it is combined with &#1488;&#1500; of hanging on. The cohortatives in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a> express intentions. Olshausen and Hitzig translate them as optatives: may I be able to rejoice; but this, as a continuation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>, seems less appropriate.
