David gave up his soul in a special manner to God. And with the words, ver. 5, our Lord Jesus yielded up his last breath on the cross, and made his soul a free-will offering for sin, laying down his life as a ransom. But David is here as a man in distress and trouble. And his great care is about his soul, his spirit, his better part. Many think that while perplexed about their worldly affairs, and their cares multiply, they may be excused if they neglect their souls; but we are the more concerned to look to our souls, that, though the outward man perish, the inward man may suffer no damage. The redemption of the soul is so precious, that it must have ceased for ever, if Christ had not undertaken it. Having relied on God's mercy, he will be glad and rejoice in it. God looks upon our souls, when we are in trouble, to see whether they are humbled for sin, and made better by the affliction. Every believer will meet with such dangers and deliverances, until he is delivered from death, his last enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou art my rock and my fortress - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>.<p>Therefore for thy name's sake - For the sake of thine own honor, or for the glory of thy name.

He seeks help in God's righteous government (Ps 5:8), and begs for an attentive hearing, and speedy and effectual aid. With no other help and no claim of merit, he relies solely on God's regard to His own perfections for a safe guidance and release from the snares of his enemies.

What he prayed for he knew him to be, and to have been in times past, and could claim his interest in him; and therefore entreats that he would appear to be to him what he was in himself, and what he had been to him; <p>therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me; either as a shepherd does his flock, gently, as they are able to bear it; into the green pastures of the word and ordinances, and beside the still waters of divine love, and to the overflowing fountain, and fulness of grace in himself; or as a general leads and guides his army; Christ being a Leader and Commander of the people, and the great Captain of their salvation, and who being at the head of them, they fear no enemy; or as a guide leads and directs such as are ignorant, and out of the way. The psalmist desires the Lord would lead him in the way of truth and paths of righteousness, according to his word; and guide him with his counsel, and by his Spirit, that so he might walk in the way in which he should go; and this he entreats he would do "for his name's sake"; not for any merit or worthiness in him; but for the glory of his own name, and for the honour of his free grace and mercy, for which the Lord often does many things; he defers his anger, he purges away the sins of his people, he forgives their transgressions, and remembers their sins no more, for his name's sake. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span>, - <span class="cmt_word">For thou art my Rock</span>; or, my <span class="accented">cliff</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5dc;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And my Fortress</span>.

In the struggle between Absalom and David more depended upon wise counsel than upon mere force (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-15.htm">2 Samuel 16:15-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-5.htm">2 Samuel 17:5-23</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 30:9-11) Nevertheless he who is thus chastened prayed fervently. The futures in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>, standing as they do in the full flow of the narration, have the force of imperfects, of "the present in the past" as the Arabian grammarians call it. From the question "What profit is there (the usual expression for &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, quid lucri) in my blood?", it is not to be inferred that David was in danger of death by the hand of a foe; for &#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a> teaches us very different, "what profit would there be in my blood?" is therefore equivalent to (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18</a>) what advantage would there be in Thy slaying me before my time? On the contrary God would rob Himself of the praise, which the living one would render to Him, and would so gladly render. His request that his life may be prolonged was not, therefore, for the sake of worldly possessions and enjoyment, but for the glory of God. He feared death as being the end of the praise of God. For beyond the grave there will be no more psalms sung, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>. In the Old Testament, Hades was as yet unvanquished, Heaven was not yet opened.
