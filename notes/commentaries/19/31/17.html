Herein he was a type of Christ, who was acquainted with grief. David acknowledged that his afflictions were merited by his own sins, but Christ suffered for ours. David's friends durst not give him any assistance. Let us not think it strange if thus deserted, but make sure of a Friend in heaven who will not fail. God will be sure to order and dispose all for the best, to all those who commit their spirits also into his hand. The time of life is in God's hands, to lengthen or shorten, make bitter or sweet, according to the counsel of his will. The way of man is not in himself, nor in our friend's hands, nor in our enemies' hands, but in God's. In this faith and confidence he prays that the Lord would save him for his mercies's sake, and not for any merit of his own. He prophesies the silencing of those that reproach and speak evil of the people of God. There is a day coming, when the Lord will execute judgment upon them. In the mean time, we should engage ourselves by well-doing, if possible, to silence the ignorance of foolish men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let me not be ashamed, O Lord, for I have called upon thee - That is, I have reposed entire confidence in thee, and in thy promises, in the time of trial; let now the result be such as to show that I had reason thus to trust in thee; that thy character is such that the persecuted and the afflicted may always find thee to be a safe and secure refuge. In other words, Let me not be disappointed, and thus be made "ashamed" before men, as if I had put my trust where no relief was to be found, or where there was nothing to authorize an act of unreserved confidence. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2-3</a>.<p>Let the wicked be ashamed - Let them be disappointed in that on which they had put their trust; let it be seen that they, in their wicked plans, had no safe ground of confidence. They rely on their strength; their skill; their courage; their resources; and not on God. Let it now be seen that these things constitute no safe ground of trust, and let not others be encouraged to follow their example by any success that shall attend them in their designs.<p>And let them be silent in the grave - Margin, "let them be cut off for the grave." Hebrew: "for Sheol." The more correct translation is that which is in the text, "Let them be silent." That is, let them go down to the grave - to "Sheol" - to the "underworld" - to the "land of silence." On the meaning of the word used here - "Sheol," the grave - see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>; and the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>. This is represented as a land of "silence." This idea is derived from "the grave," where the dead repose in silence; and the meaning here is, let them be cut off and consigned to that land of silence. It is a prayer that the wicked may not triumph. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

The fact that the poet makes mention of his iniquity as that by which his physical strength has become tottering (&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4</a>), is nothing surprising even in a Psalm that belongs to the time of his persecution by Saul; for the longer this persecution continued, the more deeply must David have felt that he needed this furnace of affliction.<p>The text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a> upon which the lxx rendering is based, was just the same as ours: &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. But this &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (Jerome nimis) would certainly only be tolerable, if it could be rendered, "I am become a reproach even to my neighbours exceedingly" - in favour of this position of &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; we might compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-2.htm">Judges 12:2</a>, - and this rendering is not really an impossible one; for not only has &#1493; frequently the sense of "even" as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>, but (independently of passages, in which it may even be explained as "and that," an expression which takes up what has been omitted, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>) it sometimes has this meaning direct (like &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, et -etiam), <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-7.htm">Isaiah 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-6.htm">Hosea 8:6</a> (according to the accents), <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-5.htm">2 Chronicles 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a> (cf. Ew. @a7352, b). Inasmuch, however, as this usage, in Hebrew, was not definitely developed, but was only as it were just developing, it may be asked whether it is not possible to find a suitable explanation without having recourse to this rendering of the &#1493; as equivalent to &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, a rendering which is always hazardous. Olshausen places &#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; after &#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497;, a change which certainly gets rid of all difficulty. Hitzig alters &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; into &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1491;, frightened, scared. But one naturally looks for a parallel substantive to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, somewhat like "terror" (Syriac) or "burden." Still &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; (dread) and &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; (a burden) do not look as though &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; could be a corruption of either of those words. Is it not perhaps possible for &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; itself to be equivalent in meaning to &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;? Since in the signification &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; it is so unsuited to this passage, the expression would not be ambiguous, if it were here used in a special sense. J. D. Michaelis has even compared the Arabic awd (awdat) in the sense of onus. We can, without the hesitation felt by Maurer and Hupfeld, suppose that &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; has indeed this meaning in this passage, and without any necessity for its being pointed &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;; for even the adverb &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; is originally a substantive derived from &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, Arab. a&#770;d (after the form &#1502;&#1510;&#1491; from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;) gravitas, firmitas, which is then used in the sense of graviter, firmiter (cf. the French ferme). &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, Arab. a&#770;d, however, has the radical signification to be compressed, compact, firm, and solid, from which proceed the significations, which are divided between a&#770;da, ja&#305;&#770;du, and a&#770;da, jau&#770;du, to be strong, powerful, and to press upon, to burden, both of which meanings Arab. 'dd unites within itself (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-9.htm">Psalm 20:9</a>). <p>The number of opponents that David had, at length made him a reproach even in the eyes of the better disposed of his people, as being a revolter and usurper. Those among whom he found friendly shelter began to feel themselves burdened by his presence because they were thereby imperilled; and we see from the sad fate of Abimelech and the other priests of Nob what cause, humanly speaking, they, who were not merely slightly, but even intimately acquainted with him (&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; as inn <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-14.htm">Psalm 55:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-9.htm">Psalm 88:9</a>, 19), had for avoiding all intercourse with him. Thus, then, he is like one dead, whom as soon as he is borne out of his home to the grave, men are wont, in general, to put out of mind also (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, oblivione extingui ex corde; cf. &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-21.htm">Deuteronomy 31:21</a>). All intimate connection with him is as it were sundered, he is become &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, - a phrase, which, as we consider the confirmation which follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a>, has the sense of vas periens (not vas perditum), a vessel that is in the act of &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, i.e., one that is set aside or thrown away, being abandoned to utter destruction and no more cared for (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/8-8.htm">Hosea 8:8</a>, together with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-38.htm">Jeremiah 48:38</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a>). With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; he gives the ground for his comparison of himself to a household vessel that has become worthless. The insinuations and slanders of many brand him as a transgressor, dread surrounds him on every side (this is word for word the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>, where the prophet, with whom in other passages also &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; is a frequent and standing formula, under similar circumstances uses the language of the psalmist); when they come together to take counsel concerning him (according to the accents the second half of the verse begins with &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1491;&#1501;), they think only how they may get rid of him. If the construction of &#1489; with its infinitive were intended to be continued in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a>, it would have been &#1493;&#1494;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; or &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1497;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. </body></html>
