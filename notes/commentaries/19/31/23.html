Let not any yield to unbelief, or think, under discouraging circumstances, that they are cut off from before the eyes of the Lord, and left to the pride of men. Lord, pardon our complaints and fears; increase our faith, patience, love, and gratitude; teach us to rejoice in tribulation and in hope.

The experience of the psalmist had shown the wisdom of trusting in God in times of danger and trouble, and had laid the foundation for a proper exhortation to others to imitate his example; an argument why all the people of God should love him, and should be of good courage. The reason here assigned for their loving the Lord is, that he preserves those who are faithful to him, and "rewards the proud doer." This is a reason for loving God, or for putting our trust in him, though the psalmist does not say that this is the only reason for doing it. The meaning here is, that the dealings of God toward the psalmist had established this truth in regard to the character of God, that he does preserve the faithful, and does punish the proud, and that this fact constitutes a reason why all his people should confide in him.<p>For the Lord preserveth the faithful - The faithful; those who put their trust in him; those who do not give up in despondency and despair in time of danger and trouble; those who do not forsake him even though for a time he seems to forsake them. What God looks for mainly in his people is confidence; faithfulness; trust; fidelity.<p>And plentifully rewardeth - "Abundantly" rewards. Literally, "in plenty." That is, his punishment does not fall short of the desert of the wicked man. It is ample or full. He does full justice.<p>The proud doer - "The man working pride." The reference is to the man who is confident in himself; who seeks to aggrandize himself, and who in doing this is regardless of the rights of others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23, 24. the Lord &#8230; proud doer&#8212;literally, "the Lord is keeping faith," that is, with His people, and is repaying, &c. Then let none despair, but take courage; their hopes shall not be in vain.   <a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/31.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>23 O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.<p>24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a><p>"O love the Lord, all ye his saints." A most affecting exhortation, showing clearly the deep love of the writer to his God: there is the more beauty in the expression, because it reveals love towards a smiting God, love which many waters could not quench. To bless him who gives is easy, but to cling to him who takes away is a work of grace. All the saints are benefited by the sanctified miseries of one, if they are led by earnest exhortations to love their Lord the better. If saints do not love the Lord, who will? Love is the universal debt of all the saved family: who would wish to be exonerated from its payment? Reasons for love are given, for believing love is not blind. "For the Lord preserveth the faithful." They have to bide their time, but the recompense comes at last, and meanwhile all the cruel malice of their enemies cannot destroy them. "And plentifully rewardeth the proud doer." This also is cause for gratitude: pride is so detestable in its acts that he who shall mete out to it its righteous due, deserves the love of all holy minds.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-24.htm">Psalm 31:24</a><p>"Be of good courage." Keep up your spirit, let no craven thoughts blanch your cheek. Fear weakens, courage strengthens. Victory waits upon the banners of the brave. "And he shall strengthen your heart." Power from on high shall be given in the most effectual manner by administering force to the fountain of vitality. So far from leaving us, the Lord will draw very near to us in our adversity, and put his own power into us. "All ye that hope in the Lord." Every one of you, lift up your heads and sing for joy of heart. God is faithful, and does not fail even his little children who do but hope, wherefore then should we be afraid? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord preserveth the faithful; </span> or, <span class="ital">keepeth faithfulness</span>, or <span class="ital">faithfulnesses</span>, i.e. is faithful in fulfilling his promises; or rather, the faithful, who is opposed to the proud doer in the next clause of the verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Plentifully, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">with</span> (for so the Hebrew <span class="ital">al</span> sometimes signifies) abundance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The proud doer; </span> the enemies and persecutors of God’s faithful ones before mentioned, whom he calls here <span class="ital">proud doers</span>, because of their rebellion against God’s will, and their contempt of his threatenings and judgments, and their most insolent and contemptuous carriage towards his people; all which proceeds from the pride of their heart, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm" title="The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.">Psalm 10:4</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O love the Lord, all ye his saints,.... To whom his goodness extends; who are favoured with the blessings of his grace, as pardon, peace, and righteousness; and who particularly are sanctified by his Spirit, and have principles of grace and holiness wrought in their hearts: these, even all of them, are called upon to love the Lord, having that grace implanted in their souls; that is, to express it, not by words, but by deeds, under a sense of the love and kindness of God to them; and to join with the psalmist in an affectionate reverence of him, trust in him, and thankfulness to him, on account of his marvellous kindness showed him; <p>for the Lord preserveth the faithful; such as trust in him, believe in Christ, and are faithful to his word and ordinances, abide by them, and stays near his people; these he not only preserves in a providential way, but he preserves them in a way of special grace; he keeps them "from evil", as the Targum; from the evil of sin; from a total and final falling away by it; from the evil of the world, so as not to be drawn off from Christ and his ways, either by its frowns or flatteries; and from the evil one, Satan, from being destroyed by him and his temptations; and these are preserved safe to the kingdom and glory of Christ, by the mighty power of God: some render the words, "the Lord keepeth faithfulness" (i); he will never suffer his own faithfulness to fail; he is a covenant keeping God, and is always true to his word and promise; <p>and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer; such as all self-righteous persons are, and all that speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the truly righteous, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-18.htm">Psalm 31:18</a>; who bear hard upon them, and oppress them; and such as antichrist and his party, who exalts himself above all that is called God; but in what those deal proudly, God is above them, an more than a match for them, and he sets himself against them; he resists them, and will reward them according to their works. <p>(i) "fidelitatem", Gejerus; or "fidelitles", Ainsworth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23, 24</span>.

By &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; prominence is given to the subject by way of contrast, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>. It appears as though Jahve had given him up in His anger; but he confides in Him, and in spite of this appearance, he even confides in Him with the prayer of appropriating faith. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-30.htm">1 Chronicles 29:30</a>) are the appointed events and circumstances, the vicissitudes of human life; like the Arabic 'ida&#770;t (like &#1506;&#1514; from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;), the appointed rewards and punishments. The times, with whatsoever they bring with them, are in the Lord's hand, every lot is of His appointment or sending. The Vulgate follows the lxx, in manibus tuis sortes meae. The petitions of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-17.htm">Psalm 31:17</a>, spring from this consciousness that the almighty and faithful hand of God has mould his life. There are three petitions; the middle one is an echo of the Aaronitish blessing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, which gives the ground of his hope that he shall not be put to shame (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a>), is to be understood like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>, according to Ges. 126, 3. The expression of the ground for &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, favours the explanation of it not so much as the language of petition (let me not be ashamed) of as hope. The futures which follow might be none the less regarded as optatives, but the order of the words does not require this. And we prefer to take them as expressing hope, so that the three petitions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-17.htm">Psalm 31:17</a>, correspond to the three hopes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-18.htm">Psalm 31:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>. He will not be ashamed, but the wicked shall be ashamed and silenced for ever. The form &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>, the plural of the fut. Kal &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, with the doubling of the first radical, which is customary in Aramaic (other examples of which we have in &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;), not of the fut.

Arabic 'a&#770;tik, 'at&#305;&#770;k, unrestrained, free<p>(Note: But these Arabic words do not pass over into the signification "insolent."))<p>is the accusative of the object, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, and as it is the nominative of the subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>. </body></html>
