All comes to sinners through the wondrous gift of the only-begotten Son of God, to be the atonement for their sins. Let not any yield to unbelief, or think, under discouraging circumstances, that they are cut off from before the eyes of the Lord, and left to the pride of men. Lord, pardon our complaints and fears; increase our faith, patience, love, and gratitude; teach us to rejoice in tribulation and in hope. The deliverance of Christ, with the destruction of his enemies, ought to strengthen and comfort the hearts of believers under all their afflictions here below, that having suffered courageously with their Master, they may triumphantly enter into his joy and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be of good courage - See a similar exhortation at the close of a psalm, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>. Compare the notes at that verse. As the result of all his own experience of the goodness of God, and of His gracious interposition in the time of danger, the psalmist exhorts others to be encouraged, and to feel assured that God would not leave or forsake them.<p>And he shall strengthen your heart - He will animate you; he will enable you to meet trial and opposition; he will keep you from becoming faint and disheartened.<p>All ye that hope in the Lord - All that put their trust in him, or all whose expectation is from him. It is a characteristic of true piety that all hope centers in God, or that the soul feels that there is no other ground of hope.<p>(a) The truly pious man despairs of success in anything else, or from any other quarter, for he feels that God alone can give success.<p>(b) He does hope in God - in reference to all that is needful for himself as an individual; all that will be for the good of his family; all that will tend to bless the world; all that he desires in heaven. Hope in God cheers him, sustains him, comforts him; makes life happy and prosperous; and makes death calm, serene, triumphant. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23, 24. the Lord &#8230; proud doer&#8212;literally, "the Lord is keeping faith," that is, with His people, and is repaying, &c.

By &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; prominence is given to the subject by way of contrast, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>. It appears as though Jahve had given him up in His anger; but he confides in Him, and in spite of this appearance, he even confides in Him with the prayer of appropriating faith. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-30.htm">1 Chronicles 29:30</a>) are the appointed events and circumstances, the vicissitudes of human life; like the Arabic 'ida&#770;t (like &#1506;&#1514; from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;), the appointed rewards and punishments. The times, with whatsoever they bring with them, are in the Lord's hand, every lot is of His appointment or sending. The Vulgate follows the lxx, in manibus tuis sortes meae. The petitions of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-17.htm">Psalm 31:17</a>, spring from this consciousness that the almighty and faithful hand of God has mould his life. There are three petitions; the middle one is an echo of the Aaronitish blessing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, which gives the ground of his hope that he shall not be put to shame (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a>), is to be understood like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>, according to Ges. 126, 3. The expression of the ground for &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, favours the explanation of it not so much as the language of petition (let me not be ashamed) of as hope. The futures which follow might be none the less regarded as optatives, but the order of the words does not require this. And we prefer to take them as expressing hope, so that the three petitions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-17.htm">Psalm 31:17</a>, correspond to the three hopes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-18.htm">Psalm 31:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>. He will not be ashamed, but the wicked shall be ashamed and silenced for ever. The form &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>, the plural of the fut. Kal &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, with the doubling of the first radical, which is customary in Aramaic (other examples of which we have in &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;), not of the fut.

It is only in accordance with the connection, that in this instance &#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>, just like &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, denotes that which is forcibly laid upon them by the judicial intervention of God: all lying lips shall be dumb, i.e., made dumb. &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; prop. that which is unrestrained, free, insolent (cf. Arabic 'a&#770;tik, 'at&#305;&#770;k, unrestrained, free<p>(Note: But these Arabic words do not pass over into the signification "insolent."))<p>is the accusative of the object, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, and as it is the nominative of the subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>. </body></html>
