That act alone was for the universe a promise and pledge, just as the covenant was a peculiar promise to Israel. Tennyson has put the same thought into verse:<p>“Thou madest man, he knows not why;<p>He thinks he was not made to die;<p>And Thou hast made him: <span class= "ital">Thou art just.”</span><p><span class= "ital">In Memoriam.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/146.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>146:5-10 The psalmist encourages us to put confidence in God. We must hope in the providence of God for all we need as to this life, and in the grace of God for that which is to come. The God of heaven became a man that he might become our salvation. Though he died on the cross for our sins, and was laid in the grave, yet his thoughts of love to us did not perish; he rose again to fulfil them. When on earth, his miracles were examples of what he is still doing every day. He grants deliverance to captives bound in the chains of sin and Satan. He opens the eyes of the understanding. He feeds with the bread of life those who hunger for salvation; and he is the constant Friend of the poor in spirit, the helpless: with him poor sinners, that are as fatherless, find mercy; and his kingdom shall continue for ever. Then let sinners flee to him, and believers rejoice in him. And as the Lord shall reign for ever, let us stir up each other to praise his holy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/146.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which made heaven and earth ... - Who is the true God, the Creator of all things. Happy is he who can address the God who called all this wondrous universe into being, and who sustains all by his power, as his God.<p>Which keepeth truth for ever - Who is always true to his promises. In this verse there are two reasons given why the lot of the people of God would be a happy one:<p>(1) That Yahweh is the true God, the Creator of all things, and, therefore, able to protect and provide for them.<p>(2) That he is faithful, and may always be relied on.<p>Idol-gods have no power, and every reliance placed on them is a vain reliance; people are often false and cannot be trusted, but Yahweh has infinite power, and every promise that he makes will be fulfilled; all that he says is eternally and unchangeably true. The reasons for trusting in him, or the reasons why they who trust in him are "happy," are further stated in the following verses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/146.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 146<p>Ps 146:1-10.

This and the following verses are a description of that divine Person, even Christ, who is the help and hope of his people; and every character of him is a reason for faith and hope in him; all things are made by him, which are in the whole compass of creation, the heaven, earth, and sea, and all in them; the fowls of the airy heaven; the sun, moon, and stars, the hosts of the starry heavens; and the angels, the inhabitants of the third heaven; the beasts of the field, and cattle of a thousand hills; and man, the chief of God's works on earth; and the innumerable fishes of the sea, great and small; and he that made all these, what is it he cannot do? he must be the mighty God, and a mighty Saviour, and the proper object of trust and hope; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; <p>which keepeth truth for ever; the truth of doctrine, who as Mediator is full of it, and by whom it came; and, as the Prophet of the church, concealed it not, from the great congregation, the law of truth being in his lips, as the antitype of Levi; the truth of the promises, which are all yea and amen in him; every promise being made to him, and being in him, as the promise of eternal life, with all others, which are safely kept by him, and he will see them performed; the truth of all his engagements with his Father, as the surety of his people; to take their nature, obey, suffer, and die for them, which he has truly and punctually made good, being faithful to him that appointed him; and the truth of all his sayings, concerning his presence with his church and ministers unto the end of the world, and of whatsoever should befall them, from his resurrection and ascension to his second coming. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/146.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which made <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein <i>is</i>: which keepeth truth for ever:</span><p>(d) He encourages the godly to trust only in the Lord, both in his power's ability to deliver them from all danger, and for his promise sake, as his will is most ready to do it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/146.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

The words with &#1500; are pure datives, cf. the accusative expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>. He in person is the support which holds fast the falling ones (&#1504;&#1493;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, here not the fallen ones, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>) in the midst of falling (Nicephorus: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;), and the stay by which those who are bowed together raise themselves. He is the Provider for all beings, the Father of the house, to whom in the great house of the world the eyes (&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; with the second e&#770; toneless, Ew. 100, b) of all beings, endowed with reason and irrational, are directed with calm confidence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>), and who gives them their food in its, i.e., in due season. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27</a> is very similar, and it proceeds here, too, as there in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-28.htm">Psalm 104:28</a> (cf. Sir. 40:14). He opens His hand, which is ever full, much as a man who feeds the doves in his court does, and gives &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, pleasure, i.e., that which is good, which is the fulfilling of their desire, in sufficient fulness to all living things (and therefore those in need of support for the body and the life). Thus it is to be interpreted, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a> (after which here in the lxx the reading varies between &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; and &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;), cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; is construed with a dative and accusative of the object instead of with two accusatives of the object (Ges. 139. 1, 2). The usage of the language is unacquainted with &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; as an adverb in the sense of "willingly" (Hitzig), which would rather be &#1489;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498;. In all the ways that Jahve takes in His historical rule He is "righteous," i.e., He keeps strictly to the rule (norm) of His holy love; and in all His works which He accomplishes in the course of history He is merciful (&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;), i.e., He practises mercy (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>); for during the present time of mercy the primary essence of His active manifestation is free preventing mercy, condescending love. True, He remains at a distance from the hypocrites, just as their heart remains far from Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>); but as for the rest, with impartial equality He is nigh (&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>) to all who call upon Him &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, in firmness, certainty, truth, i.e., so that the prayer comes from their heart and is holy fervour (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>). What is meant is true and real prayer in opposition to the &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, as is also meant in the main in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23</a>. To such true praying ones Jahve is present, viz., in mercy (for in respect of His power He is everywhere); He makes the desire of those who fear Him a reality, their will being also His; and He grants them the salvation (&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;) prayed for. Those who are called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-19.htm">Psalm 145:19</a> those who fear Him, are called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-20.htm">Psalm 145:20</a> those who love Him. Fear and love of God belong inseparably together; for fear without love is an unfree, servile disposition, and love without fear, bold-faced familiarity: the one dishonours the all-gracious One, and the other the all-exalted One. But all who love and fear Him He preserves, and on the other hand exterminates all wanton sinners. Having reached the Tav, the hymn of praise, which has traversed all the elements of the language, is at an end. The poet does not, however, close without saying that praising God shall be his everlasting employment (&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; with Olewejored, the Mahpach or rather Jethib sign of which above represents the Makkeph), and without wishing that all flesh, i.e., all men, who &#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;&#x3be; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1501;, may bless God's holy Name to all eternity. The realization of this wish is the final goal of history. It will then have reached <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a> of the great song in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a> - Jahve one and His Name one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>), Israel praising God &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, and the Gentiles &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>.). </body></html>
