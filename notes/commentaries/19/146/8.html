We must hope in the providence of God for all we need as to this life, and in the grace of God for that which is to come. The God of heaven became a man that he might become our salvation. Though he died on the cross for our sins, and was laid in the grave, yet his thoughts of love to us did not perish; he rose again to fulfil them. When on earth, his miracles were examples of what he is still doing every day. He grants deliverance to captives bound in the chains of sin and Satan. He opens the eyes of the understanding. He feeds with the bread of life those who hunger for salvation; and he is the constant Friend of the poor in spirit, the helpless: with him poor sinners, that are as fatherless, find mercy; and his kingdom shall continue for ever. Then let sinners flee to him, and believers rejoice in him. And as the Lord shall reign for ever, let us stir up each other to praise his holy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/146.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind - This is the sixth reason for what is stated as to the blessedness of those who put their trust in the Lord.

It is that those who are crushed and bowed down under the weight of care, trouble, and calamity, are raised up by him, or are sustained and comforted.

Who are corporeally blind; the eyes of many such were opened by Christ when here on earth, and one who was born blind; and such who are spiritually blind as to any knowledge of divine things, of God in Christ, of the way of life and salvation by Christ, of the Spirit and his operations, of their state and condition by nature, or of the things of the Gospel; the eyes of many such he opens so as to see their sin and danger, their want of righteousness, and need of Christ, and salvation by him; this is usually done by means of the ministry of the word, which is as an eye salve; but the work is Christ's, and a work of almighty power it is; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-4.htm">Isaiah 35:4</a>; <p>the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down; as he did in a literal sense the poor woman that was bowed together, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-11.htm">Luke 13:11</a>, and as he does in a spiritual sense such as are heavy laden with sin, and pressed with the burden of it; that are depressed with Satan's temptations, and labour under sore afflictions and exercises; all which he supports his people under, and delivers them out of; and cheers and refreshes their souls with discoveries of his love and grace unto them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-14.htm">Psalm 145:14</a>; <p>the Lord loveth the righteous; not self-righteous persons; these are not loved by God the Father, who preferred a publican to one of them; nor by Christ, who came not to call them to repentance; nor by the Spirit, who reproves and convinces men of self-righteousness; nor by angels, who rejoice at one sinner that repents more than over ninety and nine just persons who in their own opinion need no repentance: but such who are righteous through Christ's righteousness imputed to them, and there are none righteous in any other way; and these Christ loves, not for any righteousness in them, or done by them; nor does his love flow from his own righteousness upon them, for he loved them from all eternity; and his engaging and undertaking to work out a righteousness for them, and the bringing in of that righteousness, were the fruits and effects of his love to them, and evidences of it; he suffered for them when they were in themselves unjust; he died for them when sinners, ungodly, and enemies; nevertheless, as they are clothed with his perfect righteousness, and are introduced unto him and presented before him in this raiment of needle work, this clothing of wrought gold, this fine linen clean and white; he takes delight and pleasure in them, and they appear a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/146.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD openeth <i>the eyes of</i> the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> loveth the righteous:</span><p>(f) Though he visits them with affliction, hunger, imprisonment and such like, yet his fatherly love and pity never fails them, yea rather to his these are signs of his love.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/146.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>.

When he attunes his sole to the praise of God, he puts himself personally into this mood of mind, and therefore goes on to say "I will praise." He will, however, not only praise God in the song which he is beginning, but &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>), fillling up his life with it, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; (prop. "in my yet-being," with the suffix of the noun, whereas &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the verbal suffix is "I still am"), so that his continued life is also a constant continued praising, viz., (and this is in the mind of the poet here, even at the commencment of the Psalm) of the God and Kings who, as being the Almighty, Eternal, and unchangeably Faithful One, is the true ground of confidence. The warning against putting trust in princes calls to mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8</a>. The clause: the son of man, who has no help that he could afford, is to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-13.htm">Psalm 60:13</a>. The following &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493; shows that the poet by expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; combines the thoughts of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>.
