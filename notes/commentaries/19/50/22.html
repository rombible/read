And it is too common, for those who declare the Lord's statutes to others, to live in disobedience to them themselves. This delusion arises from the abuse of God's long-suffering, and a wilful mistake of his character and the intention of his gospel. The sins of sinners will be fully proved on them in the judgment of the great day. The day is coming when God will set their sins in order, sins of childhood and youth, of riper age and old age, to their everlasting shame and terror. Let those hitherto forgetful of God, given up to wickedness, or in any way negligent of salvation, consider their urgent danger. The patience of the Lord is very great. It is the more wonderful, because sinners make such ill use of it; but if they turn not, they shall be made to see their error when it is too late. Those that forget God, forget themselves; and it will never be right with them till they consider. Man's chief end is to glorify God: whoso offers praise, glorifies him, and his spiritual sacrifices shall be accepted. We must praise God, sacrifice praise, put it into the hands of the Priest, our Lord Jesus, who is also the altar: we must be fervent in spirit, praising the Lord. Let us thankfully accept God's mercy, and endeavour to glorify him in word and deed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now consider this - Understand this; give attention to this. The word "now" does not well express the force of the original. The Hebrew word is not an adverb of "time," but a particle denoting "entreaty," and would be better rendered by, "Oh, consider this;" or, "Consider this, I beseech you." The matter is presented to them as that which deserved their most solemn attention.<p>Ye that forget God - Who really forget him though you are professedly engaged in his worship; who, amidst the forms of religion, are actually living in entire forgetfulness of the just claims and of the true character of God.<p>Lest I tear you in pieces - Language derived from the fury of a ravenous beast tearing his victim from limb to limb.<p>And there be none to deliver - As none can do when God rises up in his wrath to inflict vengeance. None would "venture" to Interpose; none "could" rescue from his hand. There "is" a point of time in relation to all sinners when no one, not even the Redeemer - the great and merciful Mediator - will interpose to save; when the sinner will be left to be dealt with by simple, pure, unmixed and unmitigated "justice;" when mercy and kindness will have done their work in regard to them in vain; and when they will be left to the "mere desert" of their sins. At that point there is no power that can deliver them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/50.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. forget God&#8212;This denotes unmindfulness of His true character.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/50.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.<p>"Now" or oh! it is a word of entreaty, for the Lord is loth even to let the most ungodly run on to destruction. "Consider this;" take these truths to heart, ye who trust in ceremonies and ye who live in vice, for both of you sin in that "ye forget God." Bethink you how unaccepted you are, and turn unto the Lord. See how you have mocked the eternal, and repent of your iniquities. "Lest I tear you in pieces," as a lion rends his prey, "and there be none to deliver," no Saviour, no refuge, no hope. Ye reject the Mediator: beware, for ye will sorely need one in the day of wrath, and none will be near to plead for you. How terrible, how complete, how painful, how humiliating, will be the destruction of the wicked! God uses no soft words, or velvet metaphors, nor may his servants do so when they speak of the wrath to come.

To "tear in pieces" is the act of a wild beast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>). Job declares that God "teareth him;" but otherwise the expression is scarcely used of Divine chastisements. Certainly, if God, in his anger, lays hold upon a man to punish him, there is no possible deliverance at the hand of any other man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7, 8</a>). Deliverance, if it comes at all, must come from the Redeemer within the Godhead. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/50.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The accusation of the manifest sinners. It is not those who are addressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>, as Hengstenberg thinks, who are here addressed. Even the position of the words &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; clearly shows that the divine discourse is now turned to another class, viz., to the evil-doers, who, in connection with open and manifest sins and vices, take the word of God upon their lips, a distinct class from those who base their sanctity upon outward works of piety, who outwardly fulfil the commands of God, but satisfy and deceive themselves with this outward observance. &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;, what hast thou, that thou  equals  it belongs not to thee, it does not behove thee. With &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-17.htm">Psalm 50:17</a>, an adversative subordinate clause beings: since thou dost not care to know anything of the moral ennobling which it is the design of the Law to give, and my words, instead of having them as a constant test-line before thine eyes, thou castest behind thee and so turnest thy back upon them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-17.htm">Isaiah 38:17</a>). &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; is not from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (lxx, Targum, and Saadia), in which case it would have to be pointed &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, but from &#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, and is construed here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-9.htm">Job 34:9</a>, with &#1506;&#1501;: to have pleasure in intercourse with any one. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a> the transgression of the eighth commandment is condemned, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a> that of the seventh, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-19.htm">Psalm 50:19</a>. that of the ninth (concerning the truthfulness of testimony). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, to give up one's mouth unrestrainedly to evil, i.e., so that evil issues from it. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>, has reference to gossiping company (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; signifies a thrust, a push (cf. &#1492;&#1491;&#1507;), after which the lxx renders it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a>), but it also signifies vexation and mockery (cf. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1507;); it is therefore to be rendered: to bring reproach (Jerome, opprobrium) upon any one, to cover him with dishonour. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; has, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a>, and frequently, a hostile signification. "Thy mother's son" is he who is born of the same mother with thyself, and not merely of the same father, consequently thy brother after the flesh in the fullest sense. What Jahve says in this passage is exactly the same as that which the apostle of Jesus Christ says in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-24</a>. This contradiction between the knowledge and the life of men God must, for His holiness' sake, unmask and punish, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>. The sinner thinks otherwise: God is like himself, i.e., that is also not accounted by God as sin, which he allows himself to do under the cloak of his dead knowledge. For just as a man is in himself, such is his conception also of his God (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>.). But God will not encourage this foolish idea: "I will therefore reprove thee and set (it) in order before thine eyes" (&#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, not &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, in order to give expression, the second time at least, to the mood, the form of which has been obliterated by the suffix); He will set before the eyes of the sinner, who practically and also in theory denies the divine holiness, the real state of his heart and life, so that he shall be terrified at it. Instead of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the infin. intensit. here, under the influence of the close connection of the clauses (Ew. 240, c), is &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;; the oratio obliqua begins with it, without &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (quod). &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; exactly corresponds to the German deines Gleichen, thine equal. </body></html>
