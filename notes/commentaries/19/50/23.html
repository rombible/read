And it is too common, for those who declare the Lord's statutes to others, to live in disobedience to them themselves. This delusion arises from the abuse of God's long-suffering, and a wilful mistake of his character and the intention of his gospel. The sins of sinners will be fully proved on them in the judgment of the great day. The day is coming when God will set their sins in order, sins of childhood and youth, of riper age and old age, to their everlasting shame and terror. Let those hitherto forgetful of God, given up to wickedness, or in any way negligent of salvation, consider their urgent danger. The patience of the Lord is very great. It is the more wonderful, because sinners make such ill use of it; but if they turn not, they shall be made to see their error when it is too late. Those that forget God, forget themselves; and it will never be right with them till they consider. Man's chief end is to glorify God: whoso offers praise, glorifies him, and his spiritual sacrifices shall be accepted. We must praise God, sacrifice praise, put it into the hands of the Priest, our Lord Jesus, who is also the altar: we must be fervent in spirit, praising the Lord. Let us thankfully accept God's mercy, and endeavour to glorify him in word and deed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me - That is, he truly honors me; he is a true worshipper; he meets with my approbation. The word here rendered ""offereth"" is the same which is used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>, and means "he that sacrifices:" here meaning, he that presents the sacrifice of praise. So the Septuagint: "the sacrifice of praise glorifies me." So the Vulgate. The idea is, that the worship which God requires is "praise;" it is not the mere external act of homage; it is not the presentation of a bloody sacrifice; it is not the mere bending of the knee; it is not a mere outward form: it is that which proceeds from the heart, and which shows that there is there a spirit of true thankfulness, adoration, and love.<p>And to him that ordereth his conversation aright - Margin, as in Hebrew, "that disposeth his way." Or, more literally, "To him that "prepares" or "plans" his way;" that is, to him who is attentive to his going; who seeks to walk in the right path; who is anxious to go in the road that leads to a happier world; who is careful that all his conduct shall be in accordance with the rules which God has prescribed.<p>Will I show the salvation of God - This may mean either, "I, the author of the psalm as a teacher" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>); or, "I" as referring to God - as a promise that "He" would instruct such an one. The latter is the probable meaning, as it is God that has been speaking in the previous verse. The "salvation of God" is the salvation of which God is the author; or, which he alone can give. The "idea" here is, that where there is a true desire to find the way of truth and salvation, God will impart needful instruction. He will not suffer such an one to wander away and be lost. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-9.htm">Psalm 25:9</a>.<p>The general ideas in the psalm, therefore, are<p>(1) that there is to be a solemn judgment of mankind;<p>(2) that the issues of that judgment will not be determined by the observance of the external forms of religion;<p>(3) that God will judge people impartially for their sins, though they observe those forms of religion; and<p>(4) that no worship of God can be acceptable which does not spring from the heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/50.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. offereth praise&#8212;(Ps 50:14), so that the external worship is a true index of the heart.<p>ordereth &#8230; aright&#8212;acts in a straight, right manner, opposed to turning aside (Ps 25:5). In such, pure worship and a pure life evince their true piety, and they will enjoy God's presence and favor.   <a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/50.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.<p>"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me." Praise is the best sacrifice; true, hearty, gracious thanksgiving from a renewed mind. Not the lowing of bullocks bound to the altar, but the songs of redeemed men are the music which the ear of Jehovah delights in. Sacrifice your loving gratitude, and God is honoured thereby. "And to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God." Holy living is a choice evidence of salvation. He who submits his whole way to divine guidance, and is careful to honour God in his life, brings an offering which the Lord accepts through his dear Son; and such a one shall be more and more instructed, and made experimentally to know the Lord's salvation. He needs salvation, for the best ordering of the life cannot save us, but that salvation he shall have. Not to ceremonies, not to unpurified lips, is the blessing promised, but to grateful hearts and holy lives.<p>O Lord, give us to stand in the judgment with those who have worshipped thee aright and have seen thy salvation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/50.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Praise; </span> or, <span class="ital">thanksgiving</span> as this word is rendered, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm" title="Offer to God thanksgiving; and pay your vows to the most High:">Psalm 50:14</a></span>. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm" title="Offer to God thanksgiving; and pay your vows to the most High:">Psalm 50:14</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Glorifieth me; </span> he and he only gives me the honour that I require and prize, and not he who loads my altar with a multitude of sacrifices; whereby you vainly and falsely conceit that you please and glorify me, although in the mean time you live in the gross neglect of the more important duties of piety, and justice, and charity; whereas in truth you greatly dishonour me, and my worship and service, by your infamous lives. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That ordereth his conversation aright, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">that composeth</span> or <span class="ital">disposeth</span> the way or manner of <span class="ital">his</span> (which pronoun is frequently understood) life, i.e. that lives orderly, and according to rule; for sinners are said to walk disorderly, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>,7,11</span>, and by chance, as it is in the Hebrew text, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-21.htm" title="And if you walk contrary to me, and will not listen to me; I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.">Leviticus 26:21</a>,23</span>, which is opposed to order; and the Scripture owns no order but what God prescribes or approves; and therefore this word <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">aright</span> is justly added in our translation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Will I show, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">I will make him to see</span>, i.e. to enjoy, as that verb is oft used, as we have showed again and again. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The salvation of God, </span> i.e. my salvation; that true and everlasting happiness which I have prepared for all my faithful friends and servants, and for them only.

It is not those who are addressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>, as Hengstenberg thinks, who are here addressed. Even the position of the words &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; clearly shows that the divine discourse is now turned to another class, viz., to the evil-doers, who, in connection with open and manifest sins and vices, take the word of God upon their lips, a distinct class from those who base their sanctity upon outward works of piety, who outwardly fulfil the commands of God, but satisfy and deceive themselves with this outward observance. &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;, what hast thou, that thou  equals  it belongs not to thee, it does not behove thee.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a> the transgression of the eighth commandment is condemned, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a> that of the seventh, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-19.htm">Psalm 50:19</a>. that of the ninth (concerning the truthfulness of testimony). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, to give up one's mouth unrestrainedly to evil, i.e., so that evil issues from it. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>, has reference to gossiping company (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; signifies a thrust, a push (cf. &#1492;&#1491;&#1507;), after which the lxx renders it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a>), but it also signifies vexation and mockery (cf. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1507;); it is therefore to be rendered: to bring reproach (Jerome, opprobrium) upon any one, to cover him with dishonour. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; has, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a>, and frequently, a hostile signification. "Thy mother's son" is he who is born of the same mother with thyself, and not merely of the same father, consequently thy brother after the flesh in the fullest sense. What Jahve says in this passage is exactly the same as that which the apostle of Jesus Christ says in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-24</a>. This contradiction between the knowledge and the life of men God must, for His holiness' sake, unmask and punish, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>. The sinner thinks otherwise: God is like himself, i.e., that is also not accounted by God as sin, which he allows himself to do under the cloak of his dead knowledge. For just as a man is in himself, such is his conception also of his God (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>.). But God will not encourage this foolish idea: "I will therefore reprove thee and set (it) in order before thine eyes" (&#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, not &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, in order to give expression, the second time at least, to the mood, the form of which has been obliterated by the suffix); He will set before the eyes of the sinner, who practically and also in theory denies the divine holiness, the real state of his heart and life, so that he shall be terrified at it. Instead of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the infin. intensit. here, under the influence of the close connection of the clauses (Ew. 240, c), is &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;; the oratio obliqua begins with it, without &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (quod). &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; exactly corresponds to the German deines Gleichen, thine equal. </body></html>
