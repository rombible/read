By mercy we understand the Lord's disposition to save those whom sin has rendered miserable and vile, and all the provision he has made for the redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ. The counsels of this mercy have been from everlasting, and the effects of it will endure for ever, to all who are interested in it. The Lord continues equally ready to show mercy to all who seek for it, and this is the source of all our hope and comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/136.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O give thanks unto the God of gods - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>. The supreme God; the God superior to all that is called God, or that is adored by the nations of the earth; above all to whom the name God is ever applied.<p>For his mercy... - The ground of praise here is, that it is a characteristic of the supreme God that he is a merciful Being; that there is blended in his character eternal mercy with infinite power. Mere power might fill us with dread; power mingled with mercy, and able to carry out the purposes of mercy, must lay the foundation for praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/136.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 136<p>Ps 136:1-26. The theme is the same as that of Psalm 135. God should be praised for His works of creation and providence, His deliverance and care of His people, and judgments on their enemies, and His goodness to all. The chorus to every verse is in terms of that of Ps 106:1; 118:1-4, and was perhaps used as the Amen by the people, in worship (compare 1Ch 16:36; Ps 105:45).<p>1-3.

Not only of the gods of the Gentiles, who are by name and not by nature gods; or of civil magistrates, who are so called, and seem to be designed in the next verse; but the angels, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi. Christ, our Immanuel, is the God of them, the object of their worship and adoration, being their Creator and Preserver, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a>. So the Heathens say (r) of the Maker of all things, him you may properly call the God of gods, the Supreme and Best; this title Janus has with them (s); <p>for his mercy endureth for ever; in the preservation of those excellent creatures from apostasy, when many of their species fell; and in the continuance and confirmation of them in the state in which they were created; and in making use of them as ministering spirits to the heirs of salvation; and as a guard about them while they live, and at death to convey their souls to heaven. <p>(r) Hierocles in Carm.

It was one very familiar to the Assyrians and Babylonians ('Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 56, 60, 68, etc.). In the Bible it is used by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-22.htm">Joshua 22:22</a>), Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>), Daniel (Daniel 11:36), and this psalmist. It sanctions a secondary use of the word "God," such as is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-4.htm">Psalm 96:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-1.htm">Psalm 138:1</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/135.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For the good of His proved church He ever proves Himself to be the Living God, whereas idols and idol-worshippers are vain - throughout following <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, but with some abridgments. Here only the &#1488;&#1507; used as a particle recalls what is said there of the organ of smell (&#1488;&#1507;) of the idols that smells not, just as the &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; which is here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-14.htm">Jeremiah 10:14</a>) denied to the idols recalls the &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495; denied to them there. It is to be rendered: also there is not a being of breath, i.e., there is no breath at all, not a trace thereof, in their mouth. It is different in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>, where &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (not &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;) is meant to be equivalent to the Aramaic &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;, num (an) est; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is North-Palestinian, and equivalent to the interrogatory &#1488;&#1501; (after which the Targum renders &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;). </body></html>
