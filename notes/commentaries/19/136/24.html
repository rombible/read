Blessed be God, who has provided and made known to us salvation through his Son. May we know and feel his redeeming power, that we may serve him in righteousness all our days. May He who giveth food to all flesh, feed our souls unto eternal life, and enliven our affections by his grace, that we may give thanks and praise to his holy name, for his mercy endureth for ever. Let us trace up all the favours we receive to this true source, and offer praise continually.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/136.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And hath redeemed us from our enemies - Has rescued or delivered us from all our foes; has given to us freedom and peace.<p>For his mercy ... - By all that he has done in order to redeem us; and by all the prosperity, happiness, and peace which have followed as the result of that, he has showed his mercy. So it is in the greater work of the redemption of the soul. By all the love manifested in the gift of a Saviour - by all the sufferings and toils of his life - by his "agony and bloody sweat" in the garden of Gethsemane - by his "cross and passion," by all the blessings of salvation here, all our peace, all our purity, all our consolations, all our hopes, and by all the glories of heaven hereafter - the mercy of God in our redemption is to be estimated and measured.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-13.htm">Psalm 136:13</a> &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512; (instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-11.htm">Nehemiah 9:11</a>) of the dividing of the Red Sea is peculiar; &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>, side by side with &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;) are the pieces or parts of a thing that is cut up into pieces. &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; is a favourite word taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>. With reference to the name of the Egyptian ruler Pharaoh (Herodotus also, ii. 111, calls the Pharaoh of the Exodus the son of Sesostris-Rameses Miumun, not &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, as he is properly called, but absolutely &#x3a6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;), vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-22.htm">Psalm 73:22</a>. After the God to whom the praise is to be ascribed has been introduced with &#1500; by always fresh attributes, the &#1500; before the names of Sihon and of Og is perplexing. The words are taken over, as are the six lines of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/136-17.htm">Psalm 136:17-22</a> in the main, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>, with only a slight alteration in the expression. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-23.htm">Psalm 136:23</a> the continued influence of the construction &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500; is at an end. The connection by means of &#1513;&#1473; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-8.htm">Psalm 135:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10</a>) therefore has reference to the preceding "for His goodness endureth for ever." The language here has the stamp of the latest period. It is true &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; with Lamed of the object is used even in the earliest Hebrew, but &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1500; is only authenticated by <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:6</a>, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, to break loose  equals  to rescue (the customary Aramaic word for redemption), by <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-8.htm">Lamentations 5:8</a>, just as in the closing verse, which recurs to the beginning, "God of heaven" is a name for God belonging to the latest literature, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-4.htm">Nehemiah 2:4</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-23.htm">Psalm 136:23</a> the praise changes suddenly to that which has been experienced very recently. The attribute in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-25.htm">Psalm 136:25</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15</a>) leads one to look back to a time in which famine befell them together with slavery. </body></html>
