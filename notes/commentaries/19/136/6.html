By mercy we understand the Lord's disposition to save those whom sin has rendered miserable and vile, and all the provision he has made for the redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ. The counsels of this mercy have been from everlasting, and the effects of it will endure for ever, to all who are interested in it. The Lord continues equally ready to show mercy to all who seek for it, and this is the source of all our hope and comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/136.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To him that stretched out the earth above the waters - <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>.<p>For his mercy ... - As an illustration of his benignity and kindness in preparing an abode for man, and for other creatures in the world.
