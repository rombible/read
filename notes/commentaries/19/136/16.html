It is good to enter into the history of God's favours, and in each to observe, and own, that his mercy endureth for ever. He put them in possession of a good land; it was a figure of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/136.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To him which led his people through the wilderness - For all the manifestations of his care during a period of forty years.<p>For his mercy ... - That is, his mercy was to be measured by all the protection extended over them; by all the provision made for their needs; by all that God did to defend them; by all his interposition when attacked by their enemies; by safely bringing them to the land to which he had promised to conduct them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/136.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. overthrew&#8212;literally, "shook off," as in Ex 14:27, as a contemptuous rejection of a reptile.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/136.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>16 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.<p>17 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:<p>18 And slew famous kings; for his mercy endureth for ever:<p>19 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:<p>20 And Og the king of Bashan, for his mercy endureth for ever:<p>21 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever:<p>22 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-16.htm">Psalm 136:16</a><p>"To him which led his people through the wilderness." He led them into it, and therefore he was pledged to lead them through it. They were "his people," and yet they must go into the wilderness, and the wilderness must remain as barren as ever it was; but in the end they must come out of it into the promised land. God's dealings are mysterious, but they must be right, simply because they are his. The people knew nothing of the way, but they were led; they were a vast host, yet they were all led; there were neither roads nor tracks, but being led by unerring wisdom they never lost their way. He who brought them out of Egypt, also led them through the wilderness. By Moses, and Aaron, and Jethro, and the pillar of cloud he led them. What a multitude of mercies are comprehended in the conduct of such an enormous host through a region wherein there was no provision even for single travellers; yet the Lord by his infinite power and wisdom conducted a whole nation for forty years through a desert land, and their feet did not swell, neither did their garments wax old in all the journey. "For his mercy endureth for ever." Their conduct in the wilderness tested his mercy most severely, but it bore the strain; many a time he forgave them; and though he smote them for their transgressions, yet he waited to be gracious and speedily turned to them in compassion. Their faithfulness soon failed, but his did not: the fiery, cloudy pillar which never ceased to lead the van was the visible proof of his immutable love - <p>For his mercy, changing never,<p>Still endureth, sure for ever.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-17.htm">Psalm 136:17</a><p>"To him which smote great kings." Within sight of their inheritance Israel had to face powerful enemies. Kings judged to be great because of the armies at their back blocked up their road. This difficulty soon disappeared, for the Lord smote their adversaries, and a single stroke sufficed for their destruction. He who had subdued the really mighty ruler of Egypt made short work of these petty sovereigns, great though they were in the esteem of neighbouring princes. "For his mercy endureth for ever." Mercy, which had brought the chosen tribes so far, would not be baulked by the opposition of boastful foes. The Lord who smote Pharaoh at the beginning of the wilderness march, smote Sihon and Og at the close of it. How could these kings hope to succeed when even mercy itself was in arms against them.<p>Evermore his mercy stands<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/136.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Through the wilderness; </span> through that vast howling wilderness, where there was neither way nor provision; through which none but the Almighty God could have safely conducted them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/136.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To him which led his people through the wilderness,....

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-13.htm">Psalm 136:13</a> &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512; (instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-11.htm">Nehemiah 9:11</a>) of the dividing of the Red Sea is peculiar; &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>, side by side with &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;) are the pieces or parts of a thing that is cut up into pieces. &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; is a favourite word taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>. With reference to the name of the Egyptian ruler Pharaoh (Herodotus also, ii. 111, calls the Pharaoh of the Exodus the son of Sesostris-Rameses Miumun, not &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, as he is properly called, but absolutely &#x3a6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;), vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-22.htm">Psalm 73:22</a>. After the God to whom the praise is to be ascribed has been introduced with &#1500; by always fresh attributes, the &#1500; before the names of Sihon and of Og is perplexing. The words are taken over, as are the six lines of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/136-17.htm">Psalm 136:17-22</a> in the main, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>, with only a slight alteration in the expression. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-23.htm">Psalm 136:23</a> the continued influence of the construction &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500; is at an end. The connection by means of &#1513;&#1473; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-8.htm">Psalm 135:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10</a>) therefore has reference to the preceding "for His goodness endureth for ever."

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-23.htm">Psalm 136:23</a> the praise changes suddenly to that which has been experienced very recently.
