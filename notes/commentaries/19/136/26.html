Blessed be God, who has provided and made known to us salvation through his Son. May we know and feel his redeeming power, that we may serve him in righteousness all our days. May He who giveth food to all flesh, feed our souls unto eternal life, and enliven our affections by his grace, that we may give thanks and praise to his holy name, for his mercy endureth for ever.

To know the measure of the praise due to him; to see how great is his "mercy," it would be necessary to know all that he does in heaven and on earth. That will not be known here. It will constitute the theme of contemplation and praise forever and ever. Enough, however, is known here to show the propriety of repeating again, again, and again, as in this psalm, the language, "For his mercy endureth forever;" "For his mercy endureth forever;" "For his mercy endureth forever." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/136.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

The title is full of honour. The Lord is God in the highest realms, and among celestial beings. His throne is set in glory, above all, out of reach of foes, in the place of universal oversight. He who feeds ravens and sparrows is yet the glorious God of the highest realms. Angels count it their glory to proclaim his glory in every heavenly street. See herein the greatness of his nature, the depth of his condescension, and the range of his love. Mark the one sole cause of his bounty - "For his mercy endureth for ever." He hath done all things from this motive; and because his mercy never ceases, he will continue to multiply deeds of love world without end. Let us with all our powers of heart and tongue give thanks unto the holy name of Jehovah for ever and ever.<p>Change and decay in all around Isee,<p>O thou who changest not, abide with me. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/136.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/136.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O give thanks unto the God of heaven,.... the Maker of it, in which the glory of his wisdom and power is displayed; the possessor of it, where he dwells, has his throne, and keeps his court; from whence all blessings, temporal and spiritual, come and where he has prepared glory and happiness for his people hereafter, a house eternal in the heavens, an inheritance reserved there, a better and a more enduring substance; <p>for his mercy endureth for ever; for though the above character is expressive of his sovereignty and dominion, yet he exercises it in a way of grace and mercy to the sons of men; and therefore they have reason to give thanks unto him and praise him for his kindness and favours shown to them on earth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/136.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{i}</span> O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</span><p>(i) Seeing that all ages have had most plain testimonies of God's benefits.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/136.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">the God of heaven</span>] A late title, occurring here only in the Psalter.

With reference to the name of the Egyptian ruler Pharaoh (Herodotus also, ii. 111, calls the Pharaoh of the Exodus the son of Sesostris-Rameses Miumun, not &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, as he is properly called, but absolutely &#x3a6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;), vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-22.htm">Psalm 73:22</a>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-23.htm">Psalm 136:23</a> the continued influence of the construction &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500; is at an end. The connection by means of &#1513;&#1473; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-8.htm">Psalm 135:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10</a>) therefore has reference to the preceding "for His goodness endureth for ever."
