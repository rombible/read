It is good to enter into the history of God's favours, and in each to observe, and own, that his mercy endureth for ever. He put them in possession of a good land; it was a figure of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/136.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea - Margin, as in Hebrew, shaked off. The word is applicable to a tree shaking off its foliage. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>. The same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a> : "And the Lord overthrew (Margin, shook off) the Egyptians in the midst of the sea," He shook them off as if he would no longer protect them. He left them to perish.<p>For his mercy ... - Their destruction was done in mercy to his people and to the world, for it was the means of deliverance to Israel. The death of a wicked man is a benefit to the world, and the act of removing him may be really an act of the highest benevolence to mankind. No wrong is done to such people, for they deserve to die; and the only service which can be rendered to the world through them is by their removal from the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/136.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. overthrew&#8212;literally, "shook off," as in Ex 14:27, as a contemptuous rejection of a reptile.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/136.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/136.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea,.... In the same sea which was parted for the Israelites, and through which they passed safely as on dry land; into which Pharaoh and his army entering in pursuit of them in their chariots, the Lord "shook" (u) him and them out of them, as the word signifies; and causing the waters to return and cover them; they were drowned in them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>. This was an emblem of the destruction of Satan, and of his principalities and powers, by Christ, who thereby has saved his spiritual Israel out of their hands; and of the casting of the sins of God's people into the depths of the sea, never to be seen more, or to appear any more against them to their condemnation; and of the everlasting ruin and perdition of ungodly men; <p>for his mercy endureth for ever; it was in mercy to Israel that Pharaoh and his host were destroyed, who threatened them with ruin; and therefore they sung of judgment and of mercy, and gave thanks to God for this instance of his vengeance on their enemies, and of goodness to them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>. <p>(u) "excussit", V.

The hymn, it is true, is not found in the Versions, but Dr Schechter thinks that its authenticity is established, and that its omission is accounted for, by the prominence which it gives to the house of Zadok. It was natural for Ben Sira, who knew that family in its best representative, Simon the Just, to give thanks for its election to the priesthood: it was equally natural for his grandson the translator to omit such a thanksgiving, when the high-priests of the house of Zadok had disgraced their calling, and the house of Zadok had been superseded by the Maccabaean line.

Psa 136:2 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-3.htm">Psalm 136:3</a> (God of gods and Lord of lords) are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a> (with a strong hand and stretched-out arm) from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, and frequently (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-16.htm">Psalm 136:16</a> like <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). With reference to the Deuteronomic colouring of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/136-19.htm">Psalm 136:19-22</a>, vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>; also the expression "Israel His servant" recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-14.htm">Psalm 135:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>), and still more <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, where the comprehension of Israel under the unity of this notion has its own proper place. In other respects, too, the Psalm is an echo of earlier model passages. Who alone doeth great wonders sounds like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a>); and the adjective "great" that is added to "wonders" shows that the poet found the formula already in existence. In connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-5.htm">Psalm 136:5</a> he has <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a> in his mind; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, like &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, is the demiurgic wisdom. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a> calls to mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; the expression is "above the waters," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a> "upon the seas," because the water is partly visible and partly invisible &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>).

It is a controverted point whether &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a> signifies lights (cf. &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>) or herbs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a>). The plural &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is also rare (occurring only besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-2.htm">Psalm 114:2</a>): it here denotes the dominion of the moon on the one hand, and (going beyond <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a>) of the stars on the other. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, is the second member of the stat. construct. </body></html>
