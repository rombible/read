It is good to enter into the history of God's favours, and in each to observe, and own, that his mercy endureth for ever. He put them in possession of a good land; it was a figure of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/136.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With a strong hand - A powerful hand; as by a hand that could grasp and subdue all that opposed.<p>And with a stretched-out arm - As if the arm were stretched out to strike with the utmost force, or to exert its utmost power.

The redemption of the mystical Israel of God is by a mighty Redeemer, the Lord of hosts; who has redeemed them out of the hands of their enemies, that were stronger than they, and too strong for them: the conversion of them is by the power of the grace of God, even by the exceeding greatness of his power, and yet both acts of grace and mercy; <p>for his mercy endureth for ever; it was mercy put the Lord on stretching out his arm, and showing the strength of his right hand, in delivering Israel out of Egypt; and in his love and in his pity he redeemed them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>.

Psa 136:2 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-3.htm">Psalm 136:3</a> (God of gods and Lord of lords) are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a> (with a strong hand and stretched-out arm) from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, and frequently (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-16.htm">Psalm 136:16</a> like <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). With reference to the Deuteronomic colouring of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/136-19.htm">Psalm 136:19-22</a>, vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>; also the expression "Israel His servant" recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-14.htm">Psalm 135:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>), and still more <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, where the comprehension of Israel under the unity of this notion has its own proper place. In other respects, too, the Psalm is an echo of earlier model passages. Who alone doeth great wonders sounds like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a>); and the adjective "great" that is added to "wonders" shows that the poet found the formula already in existence.

It is a controverted point whether &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a> signifies lights (cf. &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>) or herbs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a>).
