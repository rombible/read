Let this encourage those who suffer wrong, to bear it with silence, committing themselves to Him who judges righteously. These prayers are prophecies, which speak terror to the sons of violence. There will come a day of reckoning for all the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against God, his truths, and ways, and people. It would hardly be believed, if we did not witness it, that millions of rational creatures should live, move, speak, hear, understand, and do what they purpose, yet act as if they believed that God would not punish the abuse of his gifts. As all knowledge is from God, no doubt he knows all the thoughts of the children of men, and knows that the imaginations of the thoughts of men's hearts are only evil, and that continually. Even in good thoughts there is a want of being fixed, which may be called vanity. It concerns us to keep a strict watch over our thoughts, because God takes particular notice of them. Thoughts are words to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/94.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth ... - Margin, God of revenges The idea is, that it pertains to God to take vengeance, or to punish for crimes. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>. The appeal here is made to God in view of the crimes committed by others, and which are referred to in the subsequent part of the psalm. God is addressed as having the right to restrain and punish wicked people, and he is asked to interpose and assert that right in a case which clearly demanded it. The appeal is repeated to make it emphatic, or to denote "earnestness" in the petition.<p>Show thyself - Margin, as in Hebrew, "shine forth." The meaning is, Manifest thyself; come forth as such a God; prove thy right; display thy power, and show that thou art a God opposed to crime and wrong. The same Hebrew word is used here which is found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>, and which is there rendered "shine forth." See the notes at that passage. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/94.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 94<p>Ps 94:1-23. The writer, appealing to God in view of the oppression of enemies, rebukes them for their wickedness and folly, and encourages himself, in the confidence that God will punish evildoers, and favor His people.<p>1, 2. God's revenge is His judicial infliction of righteous punishment.<p>show thyself&#8212;(Compare Margin).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/94.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.<p>2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth; render a reward to the proud.<p>3 Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?<p>4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?<p>5 They break in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage.<p>6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.<p>7 Yet they say, The Lord) shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-1.htm">Psalm 94:1</a><p>"O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself" or, God of retributions, Jehovah, God of retributions, shine forth! A very natural prayer when innocence is trampled down, and wickedness exalted on high. If the execution of justice be a right thing, - and who can deny the fact? - then it must be a very proper thing to desire it; not out of private revenge, in which case a man would hardly dare to appeal to God, but out of sympathy with right, and pity for those who are made wrongfully to suffer. Who can see a nation enslaved, or even an individual downtrodden, without crying to the Lord to arise and vindicate the righteous cause? The toleration of injustice is here attributed to the Lord's being hidden, and it is implied that the bare sight of him will suffice to alarm the tyrants into ceasing their oppressions. God has but to shew himself, and the good cause wins the day. He comes, he sees, he conquers! Truly in these evil days we need a manifest display of his power, for the ancient enemies of God and man are again struggling for the mastery, and if they gain it, woe unto the saints of God.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-2.htm">Psalm 94:2</a><p>"Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth." Ascend thy judgment-seat and be acknowledged as the ruler of men, and, moreover, raise thyself as men do who are about to strike with all their might; for the abounding sin of mankind requires a heavy blow from thy hand. "Render a reward to the proud," give them measure for measure, a fair retaliation, blow for blow. The proud look down upon the gracious poor and strike them from above, as a giant might hurl down blows upon his adversary; after the same manner, O Lord, lift up thyself, and "return a recompense upon the proud," and let them know that thou art far more above them than they can be above the meanest of their fellow men. The Psalmist thus invokes the retributions of justice in plain speech, and his request is precisely that which patient innocence puts up in silence, when her looks of anguish appeal to heaven.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-3.htm">Psalm 94:3</a><p>"Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?" Shall wrong for ever rule? Are slavery, robbery, tyranny, never to cease? Since there is certainly a just God in heaven, armed with almighty power, surely there must be sooner or later an end to the ascendancy of evil, innocence must one day find a defender. This "how long?" of the text is the bitter plaint of all the righteous in all ages, and expresses wonder caused by that great enigma of providence, the existence and predominance of evil. The sound "how long?" is very akin to howling, as if it were one of the saddest of all the utterances in which misery bemoans itself. Many a time has this bitter complaint been heard in the dungeons of the Inquisition, at the whipping-posts of slavery, and in the prisons of oppression. In due time God will publish his reply, but the full end is not yet.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a><p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The matter of this Psalm plainly declares the occasion of it to be the oppressions and persecutions of God’s people by wicked and cruel tyrants and enemies, against whom he prays for the Divine aid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The psalmist, calling to God for justice, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/94-1.htm" title="O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs; O God, to whom vengeance belongs, show yourself....">Psalm 94:1-4</a></span>, complaineth of tyranny and impiety, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/94-5.htm" title="They break in pieces your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage....">Psalm 94:5-7</a></span>; teacheth fools God’s providence, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/94-8.htm" title="Understand, you brutish among the people: and you fools, when will you be wise?...">Psalm 94:8-11</a></span>; showeth the blessed effects of affliction, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man whom you chasten, O LORD, and teach him out of your law;">Psalm 94:12</a>,13</span>; and a promise of his presence with the afflicted, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-14.htm" title="For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.">Psalm 94:14</a>,15</span>.
