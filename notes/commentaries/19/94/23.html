He should see mercy through his sufferings. There is a rest remaining for the people of God after the days of their adversity, which shall not last always. He that sends the trouble, will send the rest. The psalmist found succour and relief only in the Lord, when all earthly friends failed. We are beholden, not only to God's power, but to his pity, for spiritual supports; and if we have been kept from falling into sin, or shrinking from our duty, we should give him the glory, and encourage our brethren. The psalmist had many troubled thoughts concerning the case he was in, concerning the course he should take, and what was likely to be the end of it. The indulgence of such contrivances and fears, adds to care and distrust, and renders our views more gloomy and confused. Good men sometimes have perplexed and distressed thoughts concerning God. But let them look to the great and precious promises of the gospel. The world's comforts give little delight to the soul, when hurried with melancholy thoughts; but God's comforts bring that peace and pleasure which the smiles of the world cannot give, and which the frowns of the world cannot take away. God is his people's Refuge, to whom they may flee, in whom they are safe, and may be secure. And he will reckon with the wicked. A man cannot be more miserable than his own wickedness will make him, if the Lord visit it upon him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/94.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity - The consequences of their sin. He shall punish them as they deserve. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>.<p>And shall cut them off in their own wickedness - As the result of their wickedness, and while they are engaged in perpetrating acts of sin.<p>Yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off - Expressing, by the repetition of the sentiment, the utmost confidence that this would be so. This is in accordance with the prayer with which the psalm opens, and is expressive of entire faith that God will deal justly with the children of men. However the wicked may seem to prosper and to triumph, yet the day of vengeance is approaching, and all which they have deserved will come upon them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/94.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. bring &#8230; iniquity&#8212;(Compare Ps 5:10; 7:16).<p>in their &#8230; wickedness&#8212;while they are engaged in evil doing.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their own iniquity, </span> i.e. the fruit and punishment of their sins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In their own wickedness; </span> either in the midst of their sins; or by their own wicked devices, the mischief whereof he will cause to fall upon their own heads. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Lord our God; </span> the God of Jacob, of whom they said that lie did <span class="ital">not see nor regard</span> them, but now they find the contrary proved to their cost. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/94.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity,....
