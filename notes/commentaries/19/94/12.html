The beatitude of suffering could not be made altogether plain in the Old Testament, though in Job the spirit of it is nearly reached. Here the poet sees thus far, that he who is the victim of misfortunes may be congratulated if he may stand aside and calmly watch the course of Divine Providence involving evil men in punishment. What he has himself endured has chastened him, and <span class= "ital">caused him to be quiet from the evil days</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>has calmed him in viewing evil circumstances. It would, however, but for the next clause, be more natural to understand, “shall deliver him from evil days.”<p><span class= "bld">Pit.</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm" title="The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.">Psalm 9:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/94.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/94-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man whom you chasten, O LORD, and teach him out of your law;...">Psalm 94:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest — </span>Not he that prospers in his wickedness is happy, but he whom the Lord chasteneth when he acts amiss, and thereby teaches to study and obey his law with the greater care and diligence. <span class="ital">That thou mayest give him rest, </span>&c. — For the present and short troubles of the righteous prepare them for, and lead them to, true rest and blessedness, while the seeming felicity of the wicked makes way for those tremendous judgments which God hath prepared for them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>94:12-23 That man is blessed, who, under the chastening of the Lord, is taught his will and his truths, from his holy word, and by the Holy Spirit. He should see mercy through his sufferings. There is a rest remaining for the people of God after the days of their adversity, which shall not last always. He that sends the trouble, will send the rest. The psalmist found succour and relief only in the Lord, when all earthly friends failed. We are beholden, not only to God's power, but to his pity, for spiritual supports; and if we have been kept from falling into sin, or shrinking from our duty, we should give him the glory, and encourage our brethren. The psalmist had many troubled thoughts concerning the case he was in, concerning the course he should take, and what was likely to be the end of it. The indulgence of such contrivances and fears, adds to care and distrust, and renders our views more gloomy and confused. Good men sometimes have perplexed and distressed thoughts concerning God. But let them look to the great and precious promises of the gospel. The world's comforts give little delight to the soul, when hurried with melancholy thoughts; but God's comforts bring that peace and pleasure which the smiles of the world cannot give, and which the frowns of the world cannot take away. God is his people's Refuge, to whom they may flee, in whom they are safe, and may be secure. And he will reckon with the wicked. A man cannot be more miserable than his own wickedness will make him, if the Lord visit it upon him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/94.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord - "Happy the man;" or "Oh the blessedness of the man." See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. The word here rendered "chastenest" does not mean to chasten in the sense of afflicting or punishing. It means here to instruct; to warn; to admonish; to exhort. So the word is employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-3.htm">Job 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-7.htm">Psalm 16:7</a>. The meaning here is, that the man is blessed or happy whom God so "instructs, warns, or teaches," that he understands the principles of the divine administration. Such a man will see reasons for confidence in him in trouble, and for calmness of mind until punishment is brought upon his enemies.<p>And teachest him out of thy law - Causest him, from thy word, to understand the great principles of thy government. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/94.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. On the other hand He favors though He chastens, the pious, and will teach and preserve them till the prosperous wicked are overthrown.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/94.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law;<p>13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.<p>14 For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will be forsake his inheritance.<p>15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness; and all the upright in heart shall follow it.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a><p>"Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord." The Psalmist's mind is growing quiet. He no longer complains to God or argues with men, but tunes his harp to softer melodies, for his faith perceives that with the most afflicted believer all is well. Though he may not feel blessed while smarting under the rod of chastisement, yet blessed he is; he is precious in God's sight, or the Lord would not take the trouble to correct him, and right happy will the results of his correction be. The Psalmist calls the chastened one a "man" in the best sense, using the Hebrew word which implies strength. He is a man, indeed, who is under the teaching and training of the Lord. "And teachest him out of thy law." The book and the rod, the law and the chastening, go together, and are made doubly useful by being found in connection. Affliction without the word is a furnace for the metal, but there is no flux to aid the purifying; the word of God supplies that need, and makes the fiery trial effectual. After all, the blessing of God belongs far rather to those who suffer under the divine hand than to those who make others suffer; better far to lie and cry out as a "man" under the hand of our heavenly Father, than to roar and rave as a brute, and to bring down upon one's self a death blow from the destroyer of evil. The afflicted believer is under tuition, he is in training for something higher and better, and all that he meets with is working out his highest good, therefore is he a blessed man, however much his outward circumstances may argue the reverse.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-13.htm">Psalm 94:13</a><p>"That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked." The chastening hand and instructive book are sanctified to us, so that we learn to rest in the Lord. We see that his end is our everlasting benefit, and therefore abide quiet under all trying providences and bitter persecutions, waiting our time. The Mighty Hunter is preparing the pit for the brutish ones; they are prowling about at this time, and tearing the sheep, but they will soon be captured and destroyed, therefore the people of the Lord learn to rest in days of adversity, and tarry the leisure of their God. Wicked men may not yet be ripe for punishment, nor punishment ready for them; hell is a prepared place for a prepared people; as days of grace ripen saints for glory, so days of wantonness help sinners to rot into the corruption of eternal destruction.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a><p>"For the Lord will not cast off his people." He may cast them down, but he never can cast them off. During fierce persecutions the saints have been apt to think that the Lord had left his own sheep, and given them over to the wolf; but it has never been so, nor shall it ever be, for the Lord will not withdraw his love, "neither will he forsake his inheritance." For a time he may leave his own with the design of benefiting them thereby, yet never can he utterly desert them.<p>"He may chasten and correct,<p>But he never can neglect;<p>May in faithfulness reprove,<p>But he ne'er can cease to love."<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> And whereas these ungodly persons esteem themselves the only happy men, and conclude thy people to be of all men the most miserable, because of the manifold persecutions and afflictions which they commonly suffer, and upon this account dispute against thy providence, so far is their opinion from the truth, that the contrary is most certain, that as their prosperity is a real mischief to them, so those afflictions of good men which are accompanied with Divine instructions are great and true blessings to them, themselves being judges. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/94.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord,.... Much more happy now, and hereafter, than the proud insulting persecutor of him; he is chastened of the Lord, that he might not be condemned with the world; he is chastened not in wrath, but in love; not with the chastisement of a cruel one, nor indeed of a magistrate nor a master; but of a tenderhearted father, who always does it for his profit and advantage, and therefore is he "blessed", or happy; for these chastenings are tokens of God's love, evidences of sonship, or of a man's being an adopted child of God; are for, and do work for good, either temporal, spiritual, or eternal, and even in every sense; and, besides, the Lord grants his presence in them, supports under them, and teaches by them, as follows: <p>and teachest him out of thy law; or "doctrine" (f); and may be understood of the doctrine of the Gospel, as well as of the law; the Lord teaches by his Spirit, his word, and providences; and, even by afflictive ones, he teaches men their sins and transgressions, and shows them wherein they have exceeded; brings them to a sense and confession of them, repentance and reformation; he teaches them hereby their duty, both to himself and all men, which they have neglected, and departed from; he teaches many lessons of faith, patience, humility, self-denial, and submission to his will in the school of affliction; here they learn much of God, of his power and faithfulness, truth, goodness, grace, and love, and of evangelical doctrines; of his everlasting love, of eternal election, the covenant of grace, the righteousness of Christ, and salvation by him; which the Lord makes known unto them at such seasons, and on which account they are pronounced blessed, or happy persons. <p>(f) "ex lege", sc.

This will give him such an insight into the ways of God’s Providence, as will enable him to endure calmly, without murmuring or losing heart, until the day of retribution overtakes the wicked. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-16.htm" title="When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he comes up to the people, he will invade them with his troops.">Habakkuk 3:16</a>. The A.V. rendering <span class="ital">chastenest</span> limits the meaning of the verb, which is the same as that in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-10.htm" title="He that chastises the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teaches man knowledge, shall not he know?">Psalm 94:10</a></span>. But doubtless it includes the discipline of suffering which Israel was undergoing. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm" title="Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects: therefore despise not you the chastening of the Almighty:">Job 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/3-11.htm" title="My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:...">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>. The conception of life as a discipline and education is specially characteristic of the Book of Proverbs. The wise man welcomes it, but the fool rebels against it. <span class="ital">Thy law</span> is not limited to the Pentateuch or any part of it, but is synonymous with the <span class="ital">word</span> of Jehovah, and includes all Divine revelation as the guide of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm" title="But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.">Psalm 1:2</a>). <span class="ital">The days of evil</span>, or, <span class="ital">of the evil man</span>, are the times when wrong and wrong-doers seem to have undisputed sway.
