He should see mercy through his sufferings. There is a rest remaining for the people of God after the days of their adversity, which shall not last always. He that sends the trouble, will send the rest. The psalmist found succour and relief only in the Lord, when all earthly friends failed. We are beholden, not only to God's power, but to his pity, for spiritual supports; and if we have been kept from falling into sin, or shrinking from our duty, we should give him the glory, and encourage our brethren. The psalmist had many troubled thoughts concerning the case he was in, concerning the course he should take, and what was likely to be the end of it. The indulgence of such contrivances and fears, adds to care and distrust, and renders our views more gloomy and confused. Good men sometimes have perplexed and distressed thoughts concerning God. But let them look to the great and precious promises of the gospel. The world's comforts give little delight to the soul, when hurried with melancholy thoughts; but God's comforts bring that peace and pleasure which the smiles of the world cannot give, and which the frowns of the world cannot take away. God is his people's Refuge, to whom they may flee, in whom they are safe, and may be secure. And he will reckon with the wicked. A man cannot be more miserable than his own wickedness will make him, if the Lord visit it upon him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/94.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul - The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate render this, "In the multitude of my griefs within me," etc. DeWette renders it, "Bei meinen vielen Sorgen," "in my many cares." The Hebrew word, however, properly means "thoughts;" and the idea seems to be that in the great number of thoughts which passed through his mind, so many of them perplexing, anxious, burdensome - so many of them vain and profitless - so many of them that seemed to come and go without any aim or object, there was one class that gave him comfort. They were those which pertained to God. In those thoughts he found calmness and peace. However much he might be disturbed by other thoughts, yet here he found rest and peace. In God - in his character, in his law, in his government - he had an unfailing source of consolation; and whatever trouble he might have from the cares of life, and from the evil imaginings in his own mind, yet here his soul found repose.<p>God was an unfailing refuge; and meditation on him and his perfections made the mind calm. How many thoughts pass through our minds in a single day or a single hour! Who can tell from where they come, or by what laws they are linked together! How many of them seem to have no connection with any that went before! How many of them seem to be thrown into our minds when we would avoid them! How many are vain and frivolous; how many are skeptical; how many are polluted and polluting! How many come into the mind which we would not for worlds disclose to our best friends! How few of us would walk abroad if we were conscious that all whom we meet could look into our bosoms, and see all that is passing there! What a consolation it is to us that they cannot see it! What a world of confusion and blushes would this be if, in the streets of a crowded city, or when man meets his fellow man anywhere, all that is in his bosom were known! And yet, in this multitude of thoughts - so empty, so foolish, so sinful, so vexing, so skeptical, so polluting - there are others - there are thoughts of God, of Christ, of heaven, of hope, of faith, of love, of benevolence; thoughts within us, when the divine promises come to the heart, and the prospect of heaven warms the soul. These give "comfort;" these fill the soul with "delight." Happy he who can find in his bosom, amidst the multitude of thoughts within him, those which pertain to God; to a higher life; to heaven! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/94.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. my thoughts&#8212;or, anxious cares.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the multitude of my thoughts; </span> whilst my heart was filled with <span class="ital">various and perplexing thoughts</span>, as this Hebrew word signifies, and tormented with cares and fears about my future state. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy comforts; </span> thy promises contained in thy word, and set home by thy Spirit upon my soul, and the remembrance of my former experiences of thy care and kindness to me.

The word for thoughts is used of branches of trees, thick and entwined, and so denotes perplexed and distressing thoughts; such as good men sometimes have concerning God; his awful and tremendous majesty; the perfections of his nature, particularly his power, purity, and holiness; concerning their relation to him, his presence with them, and good will towards them, which, because of their sins, they are ready to doubt of: thoughts concerning sin; that there are no sins like theirs, attended with such aggravated circumstances; that they are such as will not be forgiven; or they fear their corruptions will be too many for them, and they shall perish by them; or that they shall so fall as to bring dishonour on the ways of God; and sometimes that they have sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost: thoughts concerning the law of God their sins are a violation of, of the holiness and spirituality of it; by comparing themselves with which, they find they are very deficient, and very carnal; and ready to fear that all the curses of it belong to them, and the condemnation of it will light upon them: thoughts concerning Christ, the Saviour; that he is the Saviour of others, but not of them; that he is able to save, but they cannot think he is willing to save such vile sinners as they are: thoughts concerning the work of the Spirit of God upon them; calling it in question, fearing it was never begun, because of the power and prevalence of sin and corruption in them: thoughts concerning their present and future state; how it is with them now, and how it will be with them hereafter; how they shall pass through the troubles and difficulties of this world, and pass over Jordan's river, or get through the valley of the shadow of death; and how they shall appear before the judgment seat of God; and how things will be with them to all eternity: these are some of the perplexing and distressing thoughts, a multitude of which rise up at times in the minds of God's people, who yet are favoured with the same gracious experience the psalmist was, expressed as follows: <p>thy comforts delight my soul; such as flow from the love of God, is shed abroad in the heart; from the presence of God enjoyed; from the exceeding great and precious promises of the Gospel; from Christ, and the things of Christ, shown, brought home, and applied by the Spirit; his person, offices, fulness, righteousness, blood, and sacrifice; all which are a fund of divine consolation to a distressed mind: these are the consolations of God, of which he is the provider, author, and giver, and therefore called "the God of all comfort"; they come from Christ, the "consolation of Israel", and by the Spirit the Comforter, who sheds abroad the love of God in the heart; reveals Christ, and the things of Christ; opens and applies the promises; wherefore these comforts are called the "comforts of the Holy Ghost"; and they are usually enjoyed by means of the word and ordinances, which are "breasts of consolation"; and these are not small, but strong, and even everlasting, and which "delight the soul"; worldly comforts may delight the animal part, and please the senses, but not delight the soul, especially a wounded spirit, a distressed mind; but these will satiate the weary soul, and replenish the sorrowful soul with a joy unspeakable, and full of glory: the psalmist may here represent the church in the latter day, when in the midst of her troubles, and having many distressing thoughts concerning the issue of things; the comforts of God, from his promises, will delight her; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a>, that he will not cast off his people, nor forsake his inheritance; but judgment shall return to righteousness; that he will keep her in the hour of temptation, and avenge the blood of her slain. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/94.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the multitude of my <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</span><p>(m) In my trouble and distress I always found your present help.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/94.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">thoughts</span>] Or, as R.V. marg., <span class="ital">doubts</span>;

The "blessed" reminds one of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-9.htm">Psalm 34:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>, and more especially of <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>. Here what are meant are sufferings like those bewailed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-5.htm">Psalm 94:5</a>., which are however, after all, the well-meant dispensations of God. Concerning the aim and fruit of purifying and testing afflictions God teaches the sufferer out of His Law (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>.), in order to procure him rest, viz., inward rest (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>), i.e., not to suffer him to be disheartened and tempted by days of wickedness, i.e., wicked, calamitous days (Ew. 287, b), until (and it will inevitably come to pass) the pit is finished being dug into which the ungodly falls headlong (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a>.). &#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; has the emphatic Dagesh, which properly does not double, and still less unite, but requires an emphatic pronunciation of the letter, which might easily become inaudible. The initial Jod of the divine name might easily lose it consonantal value here in connection with the preceding toneless u&#770;,<p>(Note: If it is correct that, as Aben-Ezra and Parchon testify, the &#1493;&#1468;, as being compounded of o (u) + i, was pronounced  like the u in the French word pur by the inhabitants of Palestine, then this Dagesh, in accordance with its orthophonic function, is the more intelligible in cases like &#1514;&#1497;&#1505;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493; &#1497;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, cf. Pinsker, Einleitung, S. 153, and Geiger, Urschrift, S. 277.

Even Chajug' (vid., Ewald and Dukes' Beitrge, iii. 23) confuses this Dag. orthophonicum with the Dag. forte conjunctivum.)<p>and the Dag. guards against this: cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-18.htm">Psalm 118:18</a>. The certainty of the issue that is set in prospect by &#1506;&#1491; is then confirmed with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. It is impossible that God can desert His church - He cannot do this, because in general right must finally come to His right, or, as it is here expressed, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; must turn to &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, i.e., the right that is now subdued must at length be again strictly maintained and justly administered, and "after it then all who are upright in heart," i.e., all such will side with it, joyously greeting that which has been long missed and yearned after. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is fundamental right, which is at all times consistent with itself and raised above the casual circumstances of the time, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, like &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>, is righteousness (justice), which converts this right into a practical truth and reality. </body></html>
