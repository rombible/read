These words are not in the Hebrew text, but are easily understood out of the foregoing clause. The meaning of the verse, in substance, is, “He that instructeth the nations, and supplieth them with all the knowledge they have, can he want means of discovering what they are contriving and doing, or of finding them out? Will not he be able to trace them out in all their machinations?” Or, as Dr. Horne paraphraseth the words, “It is God who hath instructed the world, by his revelations, in religious knowledge, and, consequently, without all doubt, he cannot be ignorant of the use and abuse which men make of that unspeakable gift.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>94:1-11 We may with boldness appeal to God; for he is the almighty Judge by whom every man is judged. Let this encourage those who suffer wrong, to bear it with silence, committing themselves to Him who judges righteously. These prayers are prophecies, which speak terror to the sons of violence. There will come a day of reckoning for all the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against God, his truths, and ways, and people. It would hardly be believed, if we did not witness it, that millions of rational creatures should live, move, speak, hear, understand, and do what they purpose, yet act as if they believed that God would not punish the abuse of his gifts. As all knowledge is from God, no doubt he knows all the thoughts of the children of men, and knows that the imaginations of the thoughts of men's hearts are only evil, and that continually. Even in good thoughts there is a want of being fixed, which may be called vanity. It concerns us to keep a strict watch over our thoughts, because God takes particular notice of them. Thoughts are words to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/94.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that chastiseth the heathen - More literally, "Shall not the Reprover of nations - shall he not chastise - he that teaches man knowledge?" The idea is, that God exercises a government over the nations of the earth; that he has them under his control; that he brings heavy judgments on them; that he thus conveys great lessons to man. And shall not such a Being, in individual cases, reprove and correct for sin? It is assumed here that God, in fact, brings judgments on nations; that he does this by fire, flood, famine, pestilence; that these things are proofs that he presides over the nations of the earth; and the question here is, whether he that does this on the large scale must not be expected to do it in individual cases, so that the offender will not escape.<p>Shall not he correct? - Shall he not chastise, or bring judgments on offenders?<p>He that teacheth man knowledge ... - The idea in our translation, that he who imparts knowledge to mankind must himself possess intelligence, is a true one, but it is probably not that which is in the original. The sense is probably merely that God is the great Teacher, and this is the impression which it is intended should be impressed on the mind, leaving the consequences of this to be supplied by the reader: "He that teaches man all the knowledge that he has!" - reflect on the consequences of this, or what must follow from this! Such a Being cannot be ignorant; he must understand all things; he must, therefore, see human conduct everywhere as it is. The consequence - the result - of this is staffed in the next verse, that he must see the thoughts of man, and understand his real character. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/94.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-11.

Thus the consequent seems to be put for the antecedent, as is frequent in Scripture, and that not without emphasis, to imply that God does not know their sins with a simple or speculative knowledge, but so as to proceed upon that knowledge to judge and punish them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He that teacheth man knowledge, </span> by giving him understanding, and the knowledge of many excellent things by the light of nature, <span class="ital">shall not he know</span>? to wit, men’s thoughts, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-11.htm" title="The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.">Psalm 94:11</a></span>; and their words and actions, of which he spoke <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-6.htm" title="They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.">Psalm 94:6</a>,7</span>.

As he did the old world, by bringing a flood upon it, and sweeping away its inhabitants at once; and Sodom and Gomorrah, by raining fire and brimstone upon them, and consuming them from off the earth; and the old inhabitants of Canaan, by ejecting them out of their land for their abominations, with other similar instances: <p>shall he not correct? such audacious wretches, guilty of such atrocious crimes, such horrid murders, and gross atheism? certainly he will, as he has both a right and power to do it. The Targum is, <p>"is it possible that he should give the law to his people, and, when they have sinned, should they not be corrected?'' <p>and if these are corrected and chastised, then surely such daring and insolent wretches shall not go unpunished: or, "he that instructeth the Heathen" (d); by the light of nature in things civil and moral, and therefore has a right to punish such who act contrary to it; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>, <p>he that teacheth man knowledge; that has given him the light of nature; inspired him with reason and understanding; taught him more than the beasts of the field, and made him wiser than the fowls of the heaven; from whom he has the knowledge of all arts and sciences, liberal and mechanic, those of the lower as well as of the higher class; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>.

He that instructeth the nations, shall not he rebuke?] The word rendered <span class="ital">chastiseth</span> in A.V. includes the ideas of instruction, admonition, discipline, chastisement (LXX <span class="greekheb">ὁ παιδεύων</span>, Vulg. <span class="ital">qui corripit</span>, Jer. <span class="ital">qui erudit</span>).

This noteworthy passage stands almost by itself in the O.T. in its explicit assertion that there is a divine education of the nations, analogous to the divine education of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-5.htm" title="You shall also consider in your heart, that, as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you.">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>, &c.), an education which must involve fatherly correction and chastisement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-12.htm" title="For whom the LORD loves he corrects; even as a father the son in whom he delights.">Proverbs 3:12</a>). It anticipates the teaching of St Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:...">Romans 2:14-15</a>.
