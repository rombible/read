Let this encourage those who suffer wrong, to bear it with silence, committing themselves to Him who judges righteously. These prayers are prophecies, which speak terror to the sons of violence. There will come a day of reckoning for all the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against God, his truths, and ways, and people. It would hardly be believed, if we did not witness it, that millions of rational creatures should live, move, speak, hear, understand, and do what they purpose, yet act as if they believed that God would not punish the abuse of his gifts. As all knowledge is from God, no doubt he knows all the thoughts of the children of men, and knows that the imaginations of the thoughts of men's hearts are only evil, and that continually. Even in good thoughts there is a want of being fixed, which may be called vanity. It concerns us to keep a strict watch over our thoughts, because God takes particular notice of them. Thoughts are words to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/94.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lift up thyself - Be exalted or lifted up so as to be manifest in thy true character. The idea is that God was, as it were, sitting at his ease, or as if he were indifferent to what was occurring in the world. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>.<p>Thou Judge of the earth - Ruler of the world; to whom it pertains to exercise judgment over all classes of people, and in all circumstances. The meaning here is, that as he was the Ruler of the whole earth, this matter came without doubt under his jurisdiction. It was a case for his interposition.<p>Render a reward to the proud - A just recompence to the people who are confident in their own strength, and who are manifesting their pride in depriving others of their rights. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/94.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The first &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; has Olewejored; then the accentuation takes &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492; together by means of Dech, and &#1506;&#1494; &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512; together by means of Athnach. &#1506;&#1494;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a>, points to the enemies; what is so named is God's invincibly triumphant omnipotence. This He has put on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>), with this He has girded Himself - a military word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9</a>): Jahve makes war against everything in antagonism to Himself, and casts it to the ground with the weapons of His wrathful judgments. We find a further and fuller description of this &#1506;&#1494; &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1494;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>.<p>(Note: These passages, together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-1.htm">Psalm 104:1</a>, are cited in Cant. Rabba 26b (cf. Debarim Rabba 29d), where it is said that the Holy One calls Israel &#1499;&#1500;&#1492; (bride) ten times in the Scriptures, and that Israel on the other hand ten times assigns kingly judicial robes to Him.)<p>That which cannot fail to take place in connection with the coming of this accession of Jahve to the kingdom is introduced with &#1488;&#1507;. The world, as being the place of the kingdom of Jahve, shall stand without tottering in opposition to all hostile powers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>). Hitherto hostility towards God and its principal bulwark, the kingdom of the world, have disturbed the equilibrium and threatened all God-appointed relationships with dissolution; Jahve's interposition, however, when He finally brings into effect all the abundant might of His royal government, will secure immoveableness to the shaken earth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a>). His throne stands, exalted above all commotion, &#1502;&#1488;&#1494;; it reaches back into the most distant past. Jahve is &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;; His being loses itself in the immemorial and the immeasurable. The throne and nature of Jahve are not incipient in time, and therefore too are not perishable; but as without beginning, so also they are endless, infinite in duration. </body></html>
