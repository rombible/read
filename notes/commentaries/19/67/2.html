Pardon is conveyed by God's blessing, and secured in that. If we, by faith, walk with God, we may hope that his face will shine on us. The psalmist passes on to a prayer for the conversion of the Gentiles, which shows that the Old Testament saints desired that their advantages might also be enjoyed by others. And many Scripture prophecies and promises are wrapped up in prayers: the answer to the prayer of the church is as sure as the performance of God's promises. The joy wished to the nations, is holy joy. Let them be glad that by his providence the Lord will overrule the affairs of kingdoms; that even the kingdoms of this world shall became the kingdom of the Lord, and of his Christ. Then is declared a joyful prospect of all good when God shall do this. The success of the gospel brings outward mercies with it; righteousness exalts a nation. The blessing of the Lord sweetens all our creature-comforts to us, and makes them comforts indeed. All the world shall be brought to worship Him. When the gospel begins to spread, it shall go forward more and more, till it reaches to the ends of the earth. It is good to cast in our lot with those that are the blessed of the Lord. If nothing had been spoken in Scripture respecting the conversion of the heathen, we might think it vain to attempt so hopeless a work. But when we see with what confidence it is declared in the Scriptures, we may engage in missionary labours, assured that God will fulfil his own word. And shall we be backward to make known to the heathen the knowledge with which we are favoured, and the salvation we profess to glory in? They cannot learn unless they are taught. Then let us go forward in the strength of the Lord, and look to him to accompany the word the Holy Ghost; then Satan's kingdom shall be destroyed, and the kingdom of our Redeemer established.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/67.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That thy way may be known upon earth - The law of God; the principles and methods of the divine administration; the way in which God rules mankind and in which he bestows his blessings on people. The prayer is, that all the earth might be made acquainted with the methods in which God deals with his people, or confers favors on people. The happiness of man depends on a knowledge of the principles on which God bestows his favors; for all people are, in all things, dependent on him. The success of a farmer depends on his understanding, and complying with, the laws and principles on which God bestows a harvest; the preservation of health, the restoration of health when we are sick, depends on a knowledge of the great laws which God has ordained for the continuance of the healthy functions of our bodies, and on the use of the means which he has provided for restoring health when those functions are disordered; and, in like manner, the salvation of the soul depends on the right understanding of the method which God has appointed to secure his favor. In neither of these cases - in no case - is it the business of people to originate laws of their own; laws for the cultivation of the earth, or for the preservation of health, or for the saving of the soul. The business of man is to find out the rules in accordance with which God bestows his favors, and then to act in obedience to them. The psalmist here supposes that there are certain rules or principles, in accordance with which God bestows blessings on mankind; and he prays that those rules and principles may be everywhere made known upon the earth.<p>Thy saving health among all nations - The original word here rendered "saving health," is "salvation." It is with great uniformity so rendered. It is indeed translated "welfare," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>; help, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>; deliverance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>; helping, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>; and health, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>; but elsewhere it is in all cases rendered "salvation." The words "saving health" were adopted from an older version, but no argument should be founded on, them. The word "salvation" expresses all that there is in the original; and the prayer is, that the method by which God confers salvation on people may be made known throughout all lands. Assuredly no more appropriate prayer could be offered than that all the race may be made acquainted with the way in which God saves sinners. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/67.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. thy way&#8212;of gracious dealing (Isa 55:8), as explained by&#8212;<p>saving health&#8212;or literally, "salvation."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/67.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Nor do we desire this mercy only for our comfort, but also for the advancement of thy glory, and the propagation of the true religion among all nations, who by the contemplation of thy gracious and wonderful works to and for us will be induced to love and serve thee, and to list themselves among thy people.

The idea is not raised of any compulsory empire, but of one which will gradually extend itself, by winning the heathen over to it through the sight of Israel's blessedness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3, 4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/66.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-16.htm">Psalm 66:16</a> are addressed in the widest extent, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-2.htm">Psalm 66:2</a>, to all who fear God, wheresoever such are to be found on the face of the earth. To all these, for the glory of God and for their own profit, he would gladly relate what God has made him to experience. The individual-looking expression &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is not opposed to the fact of the occurrence of a marvellous answering of prayer, to which he refers, being one which has been experienced by him in common with the whole congregation. He cried unto God with his mouth (that is to say, not merely silently in spirit, but audibly and importunately), and a hymn (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;,<p>(Note: Kimchi (Michlol 146a) and Parchon (under &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;) read &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; with Pathach; and Heidenheim and Baer have adopted it.)<p>something that rises, collateral form to &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, as &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; to &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;) was under my tongue; i.e., I became also at once so sure of my being heard, that I even had the song of praise in readiness (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-7.htm">Psalm 10:7</a>), with which I had determined to break forth when the help for which I had prayed, and which was assured to me, should arrive. For the purpose of his heart was not at any time, in contradiction to his words, &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, God-abhorred vileness or worthlessness; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; with the accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-10.htm">Genesis 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a> : to aim at, or design anything, to have it in one's eye. We render: If I had aimed at evil in my heart, the Lord would not hear; not: He would not have heard, but: He would not on any occasion hear. For a hypocritical prayer, coming from a heart which has not its aim sincerely directed towards Him, He does not hear. The idea that such a heart was not hidden behind his prayer is refuted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-19.htm">Psalm 66:19</a> from the result, which is of a totally opposite character. In the closing doxology the accentuation rightly takes &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1493;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493; as belonging together. Prayer and mercy stand in the relation to one another of call and echo. When God turns away from a man his prayer and His mercy, He commands him to be silent and refuses him a favourable answer. The poet, however, praises God that He has deprived him neither of the joyfulness of prayer nor the proof of His favour. In this sense Augustine makes the following practical observation on this passage: Cum videris non a te amotam deprecationem tuam, securus esto, quia non est a te amota misericordia ejus. </body></html>
