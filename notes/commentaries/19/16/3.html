Those who have avowed that the Lord is their Lord, should often put themselves in mind of what they have done, take the comfort of it, and live up to it. He devotes himself to the honour of God, in the service of the saints. Saints on earth we must be, or we shall never be saints in heaven. Those renewed by the grace of God, and devoted to the glory of God, are saints on earth. The saints in the earth are excellent ones, yet some of them so poor, that they needed to have David's goodness extended to them. David declares his resolution to have no fellowship with the works of darkness; he repeats the solemn choice he had made of God for his portion and happiness, takes to himself the comfort of the choice, and gives God the glory of it. This is the language of a devout and pious soul. Most take the world for their chief good, and place their happiness in the enjoyments of it; but how poor soever my condition is in this world, let me have the love and favour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have a title by promise to life and happiness in the future state; and I have enough. Heaven is an inheritance; we must take that for our home, our rest, our everlasting good, and look upon this world to be no more ours, than the country through which is our road to our Father's house. Those that have God for their portion, have a goodly heritage. Return unto thy rest, O my soul, and look no further. Gracious persons, though they still covet more of God, never covet more than God; but, being satisfied of his loving-kindness, are abundantly satisfied with it: they envy not any their carnal mirth and delights. But so ignorant and foolish are we, that if left to ourselves, we shall forsake our own mercies for lying vanities. God having given David counsel by his word and Spirit, his own thoughts taught him in the night season, and engaged him by faith to live to God.  Verses 8-11, are quoted by St. Peter in his first sermon, after the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2:25-31; he declared that David in them speaks concerning Christ, and particularly of his resurrection. And Christ being the Head of the body, the church, these verses may be applied to all Christians, guided and animated by the Spirit of Christ; and we may hence learn, that it is our wisdom and duty to set the Lord always before us. And if our eyes are ever toward God, our hearts and tongues may ever rejoice in him. Death destroys the hope of man, but not the hope of a real Christian. Christ's resurrection is an earnest of the believer's resurrection. In this world sorrow is our lot, but in heaven there is joy, a fulness of joy; our pleasures here are for a moment, but those at God's right hand are pleasures for evermore. Through this thy beloved Son, and our dear Saviour, thou wilt show us, O Lord, the path of life; thou wilt justify our souls now, and raise our bodies by thy power at the last day; when earthly sorrow shall end in heavenly joy, pain in everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But to the saints that are in the earth - This verse also has been very variously rendered. Our translators seem to have understood it, in connection with the previous verse, as meaning that his "goodness," or piety, was not of so pure and elevated a character that it could in any way extend to God so as to benefit him, but that it "might" be of service to the saints on earth, and that so, by benefiting them, he might show his attachment to God himself. But if the interpretation of the previous verse above proposed be the correct one, then this interpretation cannot be admitted here. This verse is probably to be regarded as a further statement of the evidence of the attachment of the psalmist to God. In the previous verse, according to the interpretation proposed, he states that his happiness - his all was centered in God. He had no hope of anything except in him; none beyond him; none besides him.<p>In this verse he states, as a further proof of his attachment to him, that he regarded with deep affection the saints of God; that he found his happiness, not in the society of the wicked, but in the friendship of the excellent of the earth. The verse may be thus rendered: "As to the saints in the earth (or in respect to the saints in the earth), and to the excellent, all my delight is in them." In the former verse he had stated that, as to God, or in respect to God, he had no source of blessing, no hope, no joy, beyond him, or independent of him; in this verse he says that in respect to the saints - the excellent of the earth - all his delight was in them. Thus he was conscious of true attachment to God and to his people. Thus he had what must ever be essentially the evidence of true piety - a feeling that God is all in all, and real love for those who are his; a feeling that there is nothing beyond God, or without God, that can meet the wants of the soul, and a sincere affection for all who are his friends on earth. DeWette has well expressed the sense of the passage, "The holy, who are in the land, and the noble - I have all my pleasure in them."<p>In the earth - In the land; or, perhaps, more generally, "on earth." God was in heaven, and all his hopes there were in him. In respect to those who dwelt on the earth, his delight was with the saints alone.<p>And to the excellent - The word used here means properly "large, great," mighty; then it is applied to "nobles, princes, chiefs;" and then to those who excel in moral qualities, in piety, and virtue. This is the idea here, and thus it corresponds with the word "saints" in the former member of the verse. The idea is that he found his pleasure, not in the rich and the great, not in princes and nobles, but in those who were distinguished for virtue and piety. In heaven he had none but God; on earth he found his happiness only in those who were the friends of God.<p>In whom is all my delight - I find all my happiness in their society and friendship. The true state of my heart is indicated by my love for them. Everywhere, and at all times, love for those who love God, and a disposition to find our happiness in their friendship, will be a characteristic of true piety. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. saints&#8212;or, persons consecrated to God, set apart from others to His service.<p>in the earth&#8212;that is, land of Palestine, the residence of God's chosen people&#8212;figuratively for the Church.<p>excellent&#8212;or, "nobles," distinguished for moral excellence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But, </span> i.e. but my goodness extendeth, which is easily understood out of the former verse; from which also there may be fetched another supplement; <span class="ital">O my soul, thou hast said, to the saints</span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To the saints that are in the earth, </span> i.e. to those holy and righteous persons that live upon earth with me; to these only or principally my goodness is extended.

The general sense will remain the same as in (1).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) Combining the two alternatives in R.V. marg., we may connect <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-3.htm" title="But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.">Psalm 16:3</a></span> both with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm" title="O my soul, you have said to the LORD, You are my Lord: my goodness extends not to you;">Psalm 16:2</a></span> and with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm" title="Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.">Psalm 16:4</a></span> thus: (I have said) unto the saints &c., and the excellent in whom is all my delight: their sorrows &c. Secure in his own choice of Jehovah he warns others against the fatal consequences of apostasy, and repudiates the idea of it for himself. In this case it is possible that <span class="ital">saints</span> may mean <span class="ital">holy</span> by calling, though not necessarily in character; and <span class="ital">excellent</span> may mean <span class="ital">nobles</span> in rank only.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(4) Taking the second alternative of R.V. marg. only, we may render: As for the saints … and the excellent in whom is all my delight: their sorrows &c. So Ewald, who explains, “<span class="ital">This</span> seems most profoundly to distress him, that the very Israelites, who ought to be the saints and pass for such … the noble, princely men, whom he especially so intensely loves, even these begin to betake themselves increasingly to heathenism.” But it is difficult to suppose that he would speak of men who were falling into idolatry in language such as this. (4) may safely be rejected; and (1) is simpler than (2) and (3), and deserves the preference.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(5) Of the host of conjectural emendations it will suffice to mention that of Baethgen, which is based on the LXX: ‘<span class="ital">Unto the saints which are in his land doth Jehovah shew honour: all his delight is in them</span>.’ It gives a good contrast to <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm" title="Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.">Psalm 16:4</a></span>, but is not convincing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">3, 4</span>.

The address to God is not merely a favourite form (Hupfeld), but the question is really, as its words imply, directed to God. The answer, however, is not therefore to be taken as a direct answer from God, as it might be in a prophetical connection: the psalmist addresses himself to God in prayer, he as it were reads the heart of God, and answers to himself the question just asked, in accordance with the mind of God. &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; which are usually distinguished from each other like &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; in Hellenistic Greek, are alike in meaning in this instance. It is not a merely temporary &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-5.htm">Psalm 61:5</a>), but for ever, that is intended. The only difference between the two interchangeable notions is this, the one denotes the finding of an abiding place of rest starting from the idea of a wandering life, the other the possession of an abiding place of rest starting from the idea of settled family life.<p>(Note: In the Arabic ja&#770;m &#8219;lllh is "one under the protection of God, dwelling as it were in the fortress of God" vid., Fleischer's Samachschari, S. 1, Anm. 1.)<p>The holy tabernacle and the holy mountain are here thought of in their spiritual character as the places of the divine presence and of the church of God assembled round the symbol of it; and accordingly the sojourning and dwelling there is not to be understood literally, but in a spiritual sense. This spiritual depth of view, first of all with local limitations, is also to be found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-5.htm">Psalm 61:5</a>. This is present even where the idea of earnestness and regularity in attending the sanctuary rises in intensity to that of constantly dwelling therein, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/84-4.htm">Psalm 84:4-5</a>; while elsewhere, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>, the outward materiality of the Old Testament is not exceeded. Thus we see the idea of the sanctuary at one time contracting itself within the Old Testament limits, and at another expanding more in accordance with the spirit of the New Testament; since in this matter, as in the matter of sacrifice, the spirit of the New Testament already shows signs of life, and works powerfully through its cosmical veil, without that veil being as yet rent. The answer to the question, so like the spirit of the New Testament in its intention, is also itself no less New Testament in its character: Not every one who saith Lord, Lord, but they who do the will of God, shall enjoy the rights of friendship with Him. But His will concerns the very substance of the Law, viz., our duties towards all men, and the inward state of the heart towards God.<p>In the expression &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-18.htm">Proverbs 28:18</a>), &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is either a closer definition of the subject: one walking as an upright man, like &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; one going about as a slanderer, cf. &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-7.htm">Micah 2:7</a> "the upright as one walking;" or it is an accusative of the object, as in &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a> : one who walks uprightness, i.e., one who makes uprightness his way, his mode of action; since &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; may mean integrum  equals  integritas, and this is strongly favoured by &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, which is used interchangeably with it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-12.htm">Psalm 84:12</a> (those who walk in uprightness). Instead of &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; we have the poetical form of expression &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;. The characterising of the outward walk and action is followed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a> by the characterising of the inward nature: speaking truth in his heart, not: with his heart (not merely with his mouth); for in the phrase &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;, &#1489;&#1468; is always the Beth of the place, not of the instrument-the meaning therefore is: it is not falsehood and deceit that he thinks and plans inwardly, but truth (Hitz.). We have three characteristics here: a spotless walk, conduct ordered according to God's will, and a truth-loving mode of thought. </body></html>
