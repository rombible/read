The sense is, Idolaters, notwithstanding all their zeal or cost about their idols, gain nothing to themselves but abundance of sorrow and misery. This he mentions as a reason why he would have no fellowship with them in their idolatrous worship; and also, that by this comparison he might illustrate and commend his own happiness, in having the Lord for his portion, of which he speaks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot....">Psalm 16:5-6</a>. <span class="ital">Their drink-offerings of blood — </span>Under which he comprehends all their offerings, none of which would he be concerned in offering; but he mentions these particularly, because of the peculiar wickedness implied in these sacrifices, more than in others. For in these, as divers learned men have observed, the heathen used not only to offer, but even to drink part of the blood of their sacrifices, whether of beasts or men, according as either of them were sacrificed. Which must needs have been very hateful to God, because he had so severely forbidden his people to drink or eat blood, either at their sacrifices or at their common meals. By this the psalmist probably meant to convince those Israelites of the greatness of their sin who hankered after idolatry, and made no conscience of maintaining communion with idolaters, (which was the case with many of them in Saul’s time,) as well as to justify himself for his detestation of them and of all fellowship with them. <span class="ital">Nor take up their names into my lips — </span>The names of those other gods mentioned before. I abhor the very name and memory of them. Not that he thought it absolutely unlawful to mention the names of these idols, which is frequently done by holy prophets, but he means thus to express the odiousness of idolatry, by showing his hatred to the very names of idols.

Those who have avowed that the Lord is their Lord, should often put themselves in mind of what they have done, take the comfort of it, and live up to it. He devotes himself to the honour of God, in the service of the saints. Saints on earth we must be, or we shall never be saints in heaven. Those renewed by the grace of God, and devoted to the glory of God, are saints on earth. The saints in the earth are excellent ones, yet some of them so poor, that they needed to have David's goodness extended to them. David declares his resolution to have no fellowship with the works of darkness; he repeats the solemn choice he had made of God for his portion and happiness, takes to himself the comfort of the choice, and gives God the glory of it. This is the language of a devout and pious soul. Most take the world for their chief good, and place their happiness in the enjoyments of it; but how poor soever my condition is in this world, let me have the love and favour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have a title by promise to life and happiness in the future state; and I have enough. Heaven is an inheritance; we must take that for our home, our rest, our everlasting good, and look upon this world to be no more ours, than the country through which is our road to our Father's house. Those that have God for their portion, have a goodly heritage. Return unto thy rest, O my soul, and look no further. Gracious persons, though they still covet more of God, never covet more than God; but, being satisfied of his loving-kindness, are abundantly satisfied with it: they envy not any their carnal mirth and delights. But so ignorant and foolish are we, that if left to ourselves, we shall forsake our own mercies for lying vanities. God having given David counsel by his word and Spirit, his own thoughts taught him in the night season, and engaged him by faith to live to God.  Verses 8-11, are quoted by St. Peter in his first sermon, after the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2:25-31; he declared that David in them speaks concerning Christ, and particularly of his resurrection. And Christ being the Head of the body, the church, these verses may be applied to all Christians, guided and animated by the Spirit of Christ; and we may hence learn, that it is our wisdom and duty to set the Lord always before us. And if our eyes are ever toward God, our hearts and tongues may ever rejoice in him. Death destroys the hope of man, but not the hope of a real Christian. Christ's resurrection is an earnest of the believer's resurrection. In this world sorrow is our lot, but in heaven there is joy, a fulness of joy; our pleasures here are for a moment, but those at God's right hand are pleasures for evermore. Through this thy beloved Son, and our dear Saviour, thou wilt show us, O Lord, the path of life; thou wilt justify our souls now, and raise our bodies by thy power at the last day; when earthly sorrow shall end in heavenly joy, pain in everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their sorrows shall be multiplied - The word here rendered "sorrows - &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  &#8219;atstsebo&#770;th - may mean either idols or sorrows. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-5.htm">Isaiah 48:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-24.htm">Psalm 139:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-28.htm">Job 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>. Some propose to render it, "Their idols are multiplied;" that is, many are the gods which others worship, while I worship one God only. So Gesenius understands it. So also the Aramaic Paraphrase renders it. But the common construction is probably the correct one, meaning that sorrow, pain, anguish, must always attend the worship of any other gods than the true God; and that therefore the psalmist would not he found among their number, or be united with them in their devotions.<p>That hasten after another god - Prof. Alexander renders this, "Another they have purchased." Dr. Horsley, "Who betroth themselves to another." The Septuagint, "After these things they are in haste." The Latin Vulgate, "Afterward they make haste." The Hebrew word - &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;  ma&#770;har - properly means to hasten; to be quick, prompt, apt. It is twice used <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16</a> in the sense of "buying or endowing;" that is, procuring a wife by a price paid to her parents; but the common meaning of the word is to hasten, and this is clearly the sense here. The idea is that the persons referred to show a readiness or willingness to forsake the true God, and to render service to other gods. Their conduct shows that they do not hesitate to do this when it is proposed to them; that they embrace the first opportunity to do it. Men hesitate and delay when it is proposed to them to serve the true God; they readily embrace an opposite course - following the world and sin.<p>Their drink-offerings of blood - It was usual to pour out a drink-offering of wine or water in the worship of idol gods, and even of the true God. Thus Jacob <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a> is said to have set up a pillar in Padan-aram, and to have "poured a drink-offering thereon." Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a>; Lev, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5</a>. The phrase "drink-offerings of blood" would seem to imply that the blood of the animals slain in sacrifice was often mingled with the wine or water that was thus poured out in the services of the pagan gods. So Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and Michaelis suppose. It would seem, also, that the worshippers themselves drank this mingled cup. They did this when they bound themselves by a solemn oath to perform any dangerous service. DeWette. The eating, and consequently the drinking of blood, was solemnly forbidden to the Israelites (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>); and the idea here is, that the psalmist had solemnly resolved that he would not partake of the abominations of the pagan, or be united with them in any way in their worship.<p>Nor take up their names into my lips - As objects of worship. That is, I will not in any way acknowledge them as gods, or render to them the homage which is due to God. The very mention of the name of any other god than the true God was solemnly forbidden by the law of Moses <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a>, "And make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth." So the apostle Paul says <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>, "But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not once be named among you, as becometh saints." The idea in these places seems to be, that the mere mention of these things would tend to produce dangerous familiarity with them, and by such familiarity take off something of the repugnance and horror with which they should be regarded, They were, in other words, to be utterly avoided; they were never to be thought of or named; they were to be treated as though they were not. No one can safely so familiarize himself with vice as to render it a frequent subject of conversation. Pollution will flow into the heart from words which describe pollution, even when there is no intention that the use of such words should produce contamination. No one can be familiar with stories or songs of a polluted nature, and still retain a heart of purity. "The very passage of a polluted thought through the mind leaves pollution behind it." How much more is the mind polluted when the thought is dwelt upon, and when utterance is given to it in language! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. He expresses his abhorrence of those who seek other sources of happiness or objects of worship, and, by characterizing their rites by drink offerings of blood, clearly denotes idolaters. The word for "sorrows" is by some rendered "idols"; but, though a similar word to that for idols, it is not the same. In selecting such a term, there may be an allusion, by the author, to the sorrows produced by idolatrous practices.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That hasten after another god; </span> or, that present or endtoo (as this verb signifies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-16.htm" title="And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.">Exodus 22:16</a></span>) another god, to wit, with oblations, as it follows. God is not expressed in the Hebrew text, but seems fitly and necessarily to be understood, because of the following offerings, which are made to none that is not either really or by reputation a god. The sense is, Idolaters, notwithstanding all their zeal or cost about their idols, gain nothing to themselves but abundance of sorrow and misery. This he mentioneth partly as one reason why he would have no fellowship with them in their idolatrous worship, which he adds in this verse; and partly that by this comparison he might illustrate and commend his own happiness, in having the Lord for his portion, of which he speaks, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5</a>,6</span>.

Of blood; in which the Gentiles used (as divers learued men have observed) to offer, and sometimes to drink part of the blood of their sacrifices, whether of beasts or of men, as either of them were sacrificed; which must needs be very hateful to God, because he had so severely forbidden the drinking of blood to his people, either at their sacrifices, or in their common food. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Nor take up their names, </span> i.e. of those other gods mentioned before.

Not the sorrows of the saints and excellent ones, by seeing the idolatry of men, as Aben Ezra interprets it; but the sorrows of such <p>that hasten after another god; a false god, an idol, to serve and worship it; for, generally speaking, idolaters are more forward, eager, and hasty to attend a false worship, than the worshippers of the true God are to attend his service: now their sorrows are many, even in their worship, by cutting their bodies with knives and lancets, as the worshippers of Baal did; and by sacrificing their own children, which, notwithstanding their rash and precipitate zeal, could not fail of giving them pain and uneasiness; and, besides temporal punishments inflicted on them for their idolatry by God, and stings of conscience, which must sometimes attend them, the wrath of God lies upon them, and they will have their portion in the lake of fire, and the smoke of their torment will ascend for ever and ever. Some render the words, "their idols are multiplied"; and so the Chaldee paraphrase, <p>"they multiply their idols, and after that hasten to offer their sacrifices;'' <p>when men leave the true God, they know not where to stop; the Heathens had not less than thirty thousand gods, and the Jews when they fell into idolatry ran in the same way, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a>. The word "god" is not in the original text, though the supplement is countenanced by the Jewish writers (p), who interpret it in this way; but I rather think the text is to be understood not of Heathen idolaters, but of unbelieving Jews, who, rejecting the true Messiah, hasten after another Messiah, king, and saviour; when Jesus the true Messiah came they received him not; but when another came in his own name they were eager to embrace him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; and to this day they are hastening after another; and in their daily prayers pray that the coming of the Messiah might be  "in haste", in their days (q); and the sense of the passage is, that the sorrows of the Jews, rejecting the Messiah and hastening after another, would come thick and fast upon them, until wrath came upon them to the uttermost, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>; and it holds good of all, whether Jews or Gentiles, that hasten after another saviour; that say to the works of their hands, that they are their gods, or go about to establish a righteousness of their own, or seek for life and salvation by their own doings; these, sooner or later, will lie down in sorrow, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-11.htm">Isaiah 50:11</a>; <p>their drink offerings of blood will I not offer: meaning not the libations of the Gentiles, which were not wine, according to the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-10.htm">Numbers 15:10</a>; but blood, even sometimes human blood; but the sacrifices of the Jews, which were either got by blood, murders and robberies, and on that account were hateful to God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a>; or rather the sacrifices of bloodthirsty persons, whose hands were full of blood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>; and such were the offerings of the priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, in Christ's time, who were the children of them that killed the prophets, and sought after the blood of Christ. Or it may be rendered, "I will not offer their drink offerings because of blood" (r); meaning his own blood shed for the remission of sins, which being obtained, there remains no more offering for sin; and so the words may express the abolition of all legal sacrifices, and the causing of them to cease through the blood and sacrifice of Christ. This shows the person speaking to be a priest, and therefore could not be David, but must be the Messiah, who is a priest after the order of Melchizedek; and who had a better sacrifice to other up than any of the offerings of the Jews, even his own self, by which he has put away sin for ever. He adds, <p>nor take up their names into my lips; not the names of idol deities, nor of their worshippers, but of the Jews that rejected him as the Messiah, for whom he would not pray, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9</a>; and so as he refused to offer their sacrifices, he would not perform the other part of his priestly office for them in intercession; though this may also have respect to the rejection of the Jewish nation as the people of God; writing a "Loammi", <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a>, upon them, declaring them to be no longer the children of the living God; leaving their names for a curse, a taunt, and a proverb in every place; expressing the utmost abhorrence of them, and showing the utmost indignation at them, as persons whose names were not worthy or fit to be mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>. <p>(p) Jarchi, Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Ben Melech, &amp; Abendana in loc.

This is the only note of sadness in the entire psalm, and it is inserted to add force by contrast to the joyous outburst in ver. 5. If men would not cleave to Jehovah, but would "hasten after" - or perhaps it should be translated "wed themselves to" - another god (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>, the only other place where the word occurs), then they must not expect "prosperity," or joy of any kind. Their "sorrows will be multiplied;" distress and anguish will come upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>); they will have to pay dear for their apostasy. <span class="cmt_word">Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer.</span> Drink offerings of actual  blood are not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, and there is very little evidence of their having been offered by any of the heathen nations, though it is conjectured that they may have been employed in the worship of Moloch. It is therefore best to explain the expression, as here used, metaphorically, as drink offerings as hateful as if they had been of blood (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor take up their names into my lips</span>. By "their names" we must understand the names which they used - those by which they called their gods.

The description is continued in independent clauses, which, however, have logically the value of relative clauses. The perff. have the signification of abstract presents, for they are the expression of tried qualities, of the habitual mode of action, of that which the man, who is the subject of the question, never did and what consequently it is not his wont to do. &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; means to go about, whether in order to spie out (which is its usual meaning), or to gossip and slander (here, and the Piel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-28.htm">2 Samuel 19:28</a>; cf. &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;, &#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;). Instead &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493; we have &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493; (with Dag. in the second &#1500;, in order that it may be read with emphasis and not slurred over), <p>(Note: Vid., the rule for this orthophonic Dag. in the Luther.

The assonance of &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is well conceived. To do evil to him who is bound to us by the ties of kindred and friendship, is a sin which will bring its own punishment. &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; is also the parallel word to &#1512;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-27.htm">Exodus 32:27</a>. Both are here intended to refer not merely to persons of the same nation; for whatever is sinful in itself and under any circumstances whatever, is also sinful in relation to every man according to the morality of the Old Testament. The assertion of Hupfeld and others that &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; in conjunction with &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; means efferre  equals  effari, is opposed by its combination with &#1506;&#1500; and its use elsewhere in the phrase &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1492; "to bear reproach" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a>). It means (since &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; is just as much tollere as ferre) to bring reproach on any one, or load any one with reproach. Reproach is a burden which is more easily put on than cast off; audacter calumniare, semper aliquid haeret.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a> the interpretation "he is little in his own eyes, despised," of which Hupfeld, rejecting it, says that Hitzig has picked it up out of the dust, is to be retained. Even the Targ., Saad., Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, Urbino (in his Grammar, &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;) take &#1504;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492; &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; together, even though explaining it differently, and it is accordingly accented by Baer &#1504;&#1502;&#1488;&#1505;  &#1504;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; (Mahpach, Asla Legarme, Rebia magnum).<p>(Note: The usual accentuation &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1504;&#1502;&#1488;&#1505;  &#1504;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492; forcibly separates &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; from &#1504;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492; to which according to its position it belongs. And Heidenheim's accentuation &#1504;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492; &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1504;&#1502;&#1488;&#1505; is to be rejected on accentuological grounds, because of two like distinctives the second has always a less distinctive value than the first. We are consequently only left to the one given above. The MSS vary.)<p>God exalts him who is &#1511;&#1496;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-17.htm">1 Samuel 15:17</a>. David, when he brought up the ark of his God, could not sufficiently degrade himself (&#1504;&#1511;&#1500;), and appeared &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-22.htm">2 Samuel 6:22</a>. This lowliness, which David also confesses in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1-3</a>, is noted here and throughout the whole of the Old Testament, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, as a condition of being well-pleasing before God; just as it is in reality the chief of all virtues. On the other hand, it is mostly translated either, according to the usual accentuation, with which the Beth of &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; is dageshed: the reprobate is despised in his eyes (Rashi, Hupf.), or in accordance with the above accentuation: despised in his eyes is the reprobate (Maurer, Hengst., Olsh., Luzzatto); but this would say but little, and be badly expressed. For the placing together of two participles without an article, and moreover of similar meaning, with the design of the one being taken as subject and the other as predicate, is to be repudiated simply on the ground of style; and the difference among expositors shows how equivocal the expression is.<p>On the other hand, when we translate it: "despicable is he in his own eyes, worthy to be despised" (Ges. 134, 1), we can appeal to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>, where &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; is intensified just in the same way by &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, as &#1504;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492; is here by &#1504;&#1502;&#1488;&#1505;; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-23.htm">Job 31:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a>. The antithesis of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a> is also thus fully met: he himself seems to himself unworthy of any respect, whereas he constantly shows respect to others; and the standard by which he judges is the fear of God. His own fear of Jahve is manifest from the self-denying strictness with which he performs his vows. This sense of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506; is entirely misapprehended when it is rendered: he swears to his neighbour (&#1512;&#1506;  equals  &#1512;&#1506;), which ought to be &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, or: he swears to the wicked (and keeps to what he has thus solemnly promised), which ought to be &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;; for to what purpose would be the omission of the elision of the article, which is extremely rarely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>) not attended to in the classic style of the period before the Exile? The words have reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a> : if any one swear, thoughtlessly pronouncing &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506; &#1488;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489;, to do evil or to do good, etc. The subject spoken of is oaths which are forgotten, and the forgetting of which must be atoned for by an asham, whether the nature of the oath be something unpleasant and injurious, or agreeable and profitable, to the person making the vow. The retrospective reference of &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506; to the subject is self-evident; for to injure another is indeed a sin, the vowing and performance of which, not its omission, would require to be expiated. On &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506;  equals  &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506; vid., Ges. 67, rem. 6. The hypothetical antecedent (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-13.htm">2 Kings 5:13</a>) is followed by &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1502;&#1512; is an apodosis. The verb &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512; is native to the law of vows, which, if any one has vowed an animal in sacrifice, forbids both changing it for its money value (&#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1507;) and exchanging it for another, be it &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1489;&#1512;&#1506; &#1488;&#1493;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-10.htm">Leviticus 27:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-33.htm">Leviticus 27:33</a>. The psalmist of course does not use these words in the technical sense in which they are used in the Law. Swearing includes making a vow, and &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1502;&#1512; disavows not merely any exchanging of that which was solemnly promised, but also any alteration of that which was sworn: he does not misuse the name of God in anywise, &#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a> the psalmist also has a passage of the Tra before his mind, viz., <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-37.htm">Leviticus 25:37</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; signifies to give a thing away in order to take usury (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;( yrusu ekat ot r from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; to bite, &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) for it. The receiver or demander of interest is &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;, the one who pays interest &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, the interest itself &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;. The trait of character described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a> also recalls the language of the Mosaic law: &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;, the prohibition <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1511;&#1497;, the curse <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-25.htm">Deuteronomy 27:25</a> : on account of the innocent, i.e., against him, to condemn him. Whether it be as a loan or as a gift, he gives without conditions, and if he attain the dignity of a judge he is proof against bribery, especially with reference to the destruction of the innocent. And now instead of closing in conformity with the description of character already given: such a man shall dwell, etc., the concluding sentence takes a different form, moulded in accordance with the spiritual meaning of the opening question: he who doeth these things shall never be moved (&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1496; fut. Niph.), he stands fast, being upheld by Jahve, hidden in His fellowship; nothing from without, no misfortune, can cause his overthrow. </body></html>
