They are to his soul as the nest to the bird. Yet they are only an earnest of the happiness of heaven; but how can men desire to enter that holy habitation, who complain of Divine ordinances as wearisome? Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go on in the exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenly city may have to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many a thirsty desert; but wells of salvation shall be opened for them, and consolations sent for their support. Those that press forward in their Christian course, shall find God add grace to their graces. And those who grow in grace, shall be perfect in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/84.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They go from strength to strength ... - Margin," company to company." The Septuagint and Vulgate, "They go from strength to strength; the God of gods is seen in Zion." Luther, "They obtain one victory after another, that one must see that there is a righteous God in Zion." DeWette, "Going they increase in strength, until they appear before God in Zion." This last is doubtless the true idea. As they pass along, as they come nearer and nearer to the end of their journey, their strength, their ardor, their firmness of purpose increases. By their conversation; by their songs; by encouraging one another; by seeing one difficulty overcome after another; by the fact kept before their minds, and increasingly apparent, that they are constantly approaching the end of their journey - that the distance to be traveled is constantly diminishing - that the difficulties become less and less, and that they will soon see the towers and walls of the desired city - they are invigorated, cheered, comforted. What a beautiful illustration of the life of Christian pilgrims - of the bands of the redeemed - as they journey on toward the end of their course - the Mount Zion above! By prayer and praise and mutual counsel, by their songs, by the fact that difficulties are surmounted, leaving fewer to be overcome, and that the journey to be traveled is diminishing constantly - by the feeling that they are ever drawing nearer to the Zion of their home, until the light is seen to glitter and play on its towers and walls - they increase in strength, they become more confirmed in their purposes, they bear trials better, they overcome difficulties more easily, they walk more firmly, they tread their way more cheerfully and triumphantly.<p>Every one of them in Zion appeareth before God - literally, "He shall appear to God in Zion." The meaning evidently is, that they who are referred to in the previous verses as going up to Zion will be seen there, or will come before God, in the place of worship. There is a change of number here, from the plural to the singular - as, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5</a>, there is a change from the singular to the plural. Such changes are frequent in the Scriptures as in other writings, and the one here can be accounted for on the supposition that the author of the psalm, in looking upon the moving procession, at one moment may be supposed to have looked upon them as a procession - a moving mass - and then that he looked upon them as individuals, and spake of them as such. The idea here is, that they would not falter and fall by the way; that the cheerful, joyous procession would come to the desired place; that their wishes would be gratified, and that their joy would be full when they came to the end of their journey - to Zion. So it is of all Christian pilgrims. Every true believer - everyone that truly loves God - will appear before him in the upper Zion - in heaven. There their joy will be complete; there the long-cherished desires of their hearts will be fully gratified; there all that they ever hoped for, and more, will be realized. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/84.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Thither the poet is drawn by the deeply inward yearning of love, which makes him pale (&#1504;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;, to grow pale, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>) and consumes him (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>). His heart and flesh joyfully salute the living God dwelling there, who, as a never-failing spring, quenches the thirst of the soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>); the joy that he feels when he throws himself back in spirit into the long-denied delight takes possession even of his bodily nature, the bitter-sweet pain of longing completely fills him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>). The mention of the "courts" (with the exception of the Davidic <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>, occurring only in the anonymous Psalms) does not preclude the reference of the Psalm to the tent-temple on Zion. The Tabernacle certainly had only one &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;; the arrangement of the Davidic tent-temple, however, is indeed unknown to us, and, according to reliable traces, <p>(Note: Vid., Knobel on Exodus, S. 253-257, especially S. 255.)<p>it may be well assumed that it was more gorgeous and more spacious than the old Tabernacle which remained in Gibeon. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-4.htm">Psalm 84:4</a> the preference must be given to that explanation which makes &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; dependent upon &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492;, without being obliged to supply an intermediate thought like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (with hardening Dagesh like &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>, vid., the rule at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>) and &#1511;&#1503; as a more definite statement of the object which the poet has in view. The altars, therefore, or (what this is meant to say without any need for taking &#1488;&#1514; as a preposition) the realm, province of the altars of Jahve - this is the house, this the nest which sparrow and swallow have found for themselves and their young. The poet thereby only indirectly says, that birds have built themselves nests on the Temple-house, without giving any occasion for the discussion whether this has taken place in reality. By the bird that has found a comfortable snug home on the place of the altars of Jahve in the Temple-court and in the Temple-house, he means himself. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (from &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;) is a general name for whistling, twittering birds, like the finch <p>(Note: Vid., Tobler, Denkbltter aus Jerusalem, 1853, S. 117.)<p>and the sparrow, just as the lxx here renders it. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; is not the turtle-dove (lxx, Targum, and Syriac), but the swallow, which is frequently called even in the Talmud &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512; &#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; ( equals  &#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;), and appears to take its name from its straightforward darting, as it were, radiating flight (cf. Arabic jadurru of the horse: it darts straight forward). Saadia renders du&#770;r&#305;&#770;je, which is the name of the sparrow in Palestine and Syria (vid., Wetzstein's Excursus I). After the poet has said that his whole longing goes forth towards the sanctuary, he adds that it could not possibly be otherwise (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501; standing at the head of the clause and belonging to the whole sentence, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>; Ewald, 352, b): he, the sparrow, the swallow, has found a house, a nest, viz., the altars of Jahve of Hosts, his King and his God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>), who gloriously and inaccessibly protects him, and to whom he unites himself with most heartfelt and believing love. The addition "where (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-9.htm">Psalm 95:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>) she layeth her young," is not without its significance. One is here reminded of the fact, that at the time of the second Temple the sons of the priests were called &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497; &#1499;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, and the Levite poet means himself together with his family; God's altars secure to them shelter and sustenance. How happy, blessed, therefore, are those who enjoy this good fortune, which he now longs for again with pain in a strange country, viz., to be able to make his home in the house of such an adorable and gracious God! &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; here signifies, not "constantly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>), for which &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; would have been used, but "yet," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>. The relation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5</a> is therefore like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-2.htm">Psalm 41:2</a>. The present is dark, but it will come to pass even yet that the inmates of God's house (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>) will praise Him as their Helper. The music here strikes in, anticipating this praise. </body></html>
