Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go on in the exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenly city may have to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many a thirsty desert; but wells of salvation shall be opened for them, and consolations sent for their support.

The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, Luther, and Professor Alexander, render it a valley of tears. The word "Baca" (&#1489;&#1499;&#1488;  ba&#770;ka&#770;') means properly weeping, lamentation; and then it is given to a certain tree - not probably a mulberry tree, but some species of balsam - from its weeping; that is, because it seemed to distil tears, or drops of balsam resembling tears in size and appearance. It is translated mulberry trees in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-23.htm">2 Samuel 5:23-24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-14.htm">1 Chronicles 14:14-15</a>; and so in the margin here, "mulberry trees make him a well." There is no reason, however, to think that it has that meaning here. The true rendering is, "valley of lamentation," or weeping; and it may have reference to some lonely valley in Palestine - where there was no water - a gloomy way - through which those commonly passed who went up to the place of worship. It would be vain, however, to attempt now to determine the locality of the valley referred to, as the name, if ever given to it, seems long since to have passed away. It may, however, be used as emblematic of human life - "a vale of tears;" and the passage may be employed as an illustration of the effect of religion in diffusing happiness and comfort where there was trouble and sorrow - as if fountains should be made to flow in a sterile and desolate valley.<p>Make it a well - Or, a fountain. That is, It becomes to the pilgrims as a sacred fountain. They "make" such a gloomy valley like a fountain, or like a road where fountains - full, free, refreshing - break forth everywhere to invigorate the traveler. Religious worship - the going up to the house of God - turns that in the journey of life which would otherwise be gloomy and sad into joy; makes a world of tears a world of comfort; has an effect like that of changing a gloomy path into one of pleasantness and beauty. The idea here is the same which occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>, "And the parched ground shall become a pool" (see the notes at that passage); and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>, "Who giveth songs in the night" (see the notes at that passage); an idea which was so beautifully illustrated in the case of Paul and Silas in the jail at Philippi, when, at midnight they "sang praises to God" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>, and which is so often illustrated in the midst of affliction and trouble. By the power of religion, by the presence of the Saviour, by the influence of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, such times become seasons of purest joy - times remembered ever afterward with most fervent gratitude, as among the happiest periods of life. For religion can diffuse smiles over faces darkened by care; can light up the eye sunk in despondency; can change tears of sorrow into tears of joy; can impart peace in scenes of deepest sorrow; and make the most gloomy vales of life like green pastures illuminated by the brightness of noonday.<p>The rain also filleth the pools - Margin, "covereth." This is a still more difficult expression than the former. The Septuagint and the Vulgate render it, "The teacher - the lawgiver - &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  ho nomotheto&#772;n - "legislator" - gives blessings." Luther, "The teachers shall be adorned with many blessings." Gesenius, "Yea, with blessings the autumnal rain doth cover it." DeWette, "And with blessing the harvest-rain covers it," which he explains as meaning," Where they come, though it would be sorrow and tears, yet they are attended with prosperity and blessing." Professor Alexander, "Also with blessings is the teacher clothed." The word rendered "rain" - &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;  mo&#770;reh - is from &#1497;&#1512;&#1492;  ya&#770;ra&#770;h, to throw, to cast, to place, to sprinkle, and may denote<p>(1) an archer;<p>(2) the early rain<p>(3) teaching, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-28.htm">2 Kings 17:28</a>; or a teacher, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-22.htm">Job 36:22</a>.<p>It is rendered rain, in the place before us; and former rain twice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a> (margin, a teacher). The word rendered "filleth" means properly to cover, and would be fitly so translated here. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-22.htm">Ezekiel 24:22</a>. The word has not naturally the idea of filling. The word rendered "pools" - &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;  bera&#770;ko&#770;th - if pointed in one manner - &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;  bere&#770;ka&#770;h (in the singular) - denotes a pond, pool, or basin of water; if pointed in another manner - &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;  bera&#770;ka&#770;h - it means blessing, benediction, and is often so used in the Scriptures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-12.htm">Genesis 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-4.htm">Genesis 28:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a>,...The rendering of Gesenius, as above, "Yea, with blessings the autumnal rain doth cover it," (that is, the valley so desolate in the heat of summer - the valley of weeping), would perhaps be the most natural, though it is not easy to see the connection according to this interpretation, or according to any other proposed.<p>Least of all is it easy to see the connection according to the translation of the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Luther, and Prof. Alexander. Perhaps the connection in the mind of the author of the psalm may have been this. He sees the sterile and desolate valley through which the pilgrims are passing made joyous by the cheerfulness - the happiness - the songs - of those who are on their way to the house of God. This fact - this image - suggests to him the idea that this is similar to the effect which is produced in that valley when copious rains descend upon it, and when, though commonly desolate, it is covered with grass and flowers, or is "blessed" by the rain. This latter image is to his mind an illustration of the happy scene now before him in the cheerful and exulting movements of the pilgrims on their way to the house of God. The one suggests the other; and the psalmist has a combined image before his mind, the one illustrating the other, and both showing how a vale naturally desolate and sterile may be made cheerful and joyous. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/84.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. valley of Baca&#8212;or, "weeping." Through such, by reason of their dry and barren condition, the worshippers often had to pass to Jerusalem. As they might become wells, or fountains, or pools, supplied by refreshing rain, so the grace of God, by the exercises of His worship, refreshes and revives the hearts of His people, so that for sorrows they have "rivers of delight" (Ps 36:8; 46:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/84.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Passing; </span> or, <span class="ital">being used to pass</span>; for he seems not to speak of one particular act, but of a common course or custom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Baca; </span> a place, so called, which some Jewish and other writers affirm to have been a very dry place, and therefore incommodious for travellers in those hot countries, and in hot seasons; which place may be here mentioned not exclusively to other ways and passages, for this highway being but one, and on one side of Jerusalem, could not be a general way for all the Israelites thither, but synecdochically for all places of like nature, which made their journey to Jerusalem unpleasant or inconvenient.

Kimchi interprets it a valley of springs, or fountains, taking the word to be of the same signification as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-16.htm">Job 38:16</a>, and mention being made of a well and pools in it, or of mulberry trees, which grow, as he says, in a place where there is no water, and such a place was this; and therefore pools or ditches were dug in it, and built of stone, to catch rain water for the supply of travellers; and so Aben Ezra says, it is the name of a place or valley where were trees, called mulberries; and is by some thought to be the same with the valley of Rephaim, where we read of mulberry trees, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-22.htm">2 Samuel 5:22</a>, the Septuagint render it "the valley of weeping", and the Vulgate Latin version "the valley of tears"; which have led some interpreters to think of Bochim, a place so called from the children of Israel weeping there, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>, it does not seem to design any particular place, through which all the males could not pass from the different parts of the land of Israel, as they came to Zion at the three grand festivals; but any difficult and troublesome place, any rough valley, or dry and thirsty land, where there was no water: so saints are passengers, travellers, or pilgrims, in this world, and often pass through a valley; are in a low valley, through the weakness of grace; a rough one, through affliction; and a dark one, through desertion and temptation; and a valley of weeping and tears, on account both of outward and inward trials. The way to Zion, or to the house and ordinances of God below, lies through the valley of weeping; none come rightly thither but who come weeping over their sins and unworthiness; or by repentance towards God, and by looking by faith to Christ whom they have pierced, and mourning for it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Jeremiah 50:4</a> and the way to Zion above lies through a vale of tears, shed in plenty by reason of sin, a man's own, original and actual, the sins of professors and profane, by reason of Satan's temptations, the hidings of God's face, and the distresses, divisions, and declensions of Zion; yet relief is afforded, help is given, refreshment is had, in this valley, for such passengers: <p>they make it a well; either the valley a well with their tears, an hyperbolical expression, like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a> or they account it as such, a dry valley, as if it was a well watered place; look upon all their toil and labour in going to the house of God as a pleasure; and esteem all reproach, afflictions, and persecutions, they meet with from the world, or relations, for the sake of religion, as riches and honours; or they find a supply, which is kindly and graciously given, even rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of valleys, streams of divine love, and precious promises in a wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a> "or make him a well" (a): that is, God himself; they account of him as such; they find him to be so, and make use of him as one, who is a well of living waters; such are his love, his covenant, and his grace; such are his Son and his fulness, his Spirit, the gifts and graces of it; all which yield a rich supply: <p>the rain also filleth the pools; of the word and ordinances: "or the rain covereth with blessings" (b); the rain of divine love covers the passengers with spiritual blessings, which flow from it; Christ, whose coming is compared to the rain, brings a train of blessings with him to his people; and the Gospel, which drops as the rain, and distils as the dew, is full of the blessings of Christ; is a glorious revelation of them, and is the means of conveying them to the saints; or the "teacher covereth", or "is covered with blessings" (c); the great Teacher of all, God, Father, Son, and Spirit; the Father teaches all his children to great profit and advantage, and covers or blesses them with all spiritual blessings; the Son is a teacher come from God, and is covered or loaded with the blessings of goodness, and communicates them to his disciples and followers; and the Spirit teacheth all things, and takes of the things of Christ, the blessings of his grace, and covers his people with them; and all under teachers, ministers of the Gospel, are clothed with salvation, and come forth in the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ. <p>(a)  "fontem constituunt eum", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Ainsworth; "Deum ipsum", Piscator, Gejerus, Michaelis.

Passing through the vale of Baca they make it a place of springs,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Yea, the early rain clotheth it with blessings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word <span class="ital">Baca</span> is derived from the root which means <span class="ital">to weep</span>, but it nowhere means <span class="ital">weeping</span>, for which words of a different form are used. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-23.htm" title="And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, You shall not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.">2 Samuel 5:23</a>, it probably denotes some kind of balsam-tree, so called from the ‘tears’ of gum which it exudes. The vale of Baca or the balsam-trees was some vale which, like the vale of Elah or the terebinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-2.htm" title="And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.">1 Samuel 17:2</a>), and the vale of Shittim or acacias, took its name from the trees which grew there. Balsam-trees are said to love dry situations, growing plentifully for example in the arid valley of Mecca; and this is clearly the point of the reference. The vale of Baca was some waterless and barren valley through which pilgrims passed on their way to Jerusalem; but faith turns it into a place of springs, finding refreshment under the most untoward circumstances, while God refreshes them with showers of blessing from above, as the autumnal rains clothe the dry plains with grass and flowers. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm" title="The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.">Isaiah 35:1</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm" title="Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.">Isaiah 35:6</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm" title="I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the middle of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.">Isaiah 41:18</a> ff.; and see Tristram’s <span class="ital">Natural Hist. of the Bible</span>, pp. 30, 455, for a graphic description of the marvellous way in which the rains in Palestine transform the country from a brown and dusty desert to a lovely garden.
