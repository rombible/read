It was therefore impossible that any good man, who had seen the crimes of this treacherous and bloody Edomite retaliated on him by Divine Providence, should do otherwise than approve so righteous a retribution, and when he observed it, forbear to say, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm" title="See, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.">Psalm 52:7</a>, <span class="ital">Lo, this is the man, </span>&c.” — The great and famous man, <span class="ital">that made not God his strength — </span>That trusted in and feared Saul more than God, and was willing to purchase Saul’s favour with God’s displeasure; <span class="ital">but trusted in the abundance of his riches — </span>Thought himself secure in his great and growing wealth without God’s protection or blessing. “Observe the fate of this haughty slanderer and murderer!

The wicked man trusted in the abundance of his riches; he thought his wickedness would help him to keep his wealth. Right or wrong, he would get what he could, and keep what he had, and ruin any one that stood in his way; this he thought would strengthen him; but see what it comes to! Those who by faith and love dwell in the house of God, shall be like green olive-trees there. And that we may be as green olive-trees, we must live a life of faith and holy confidence in God and his grace. It adds much to the beauty of our profession, and to fruitfulness in every grace, to be much in praising God; and we never can want matter for praise. His name alone can be our refuge and strong tower. It is very good for us to wait on that saving name; there is nothing better to calm and quiet our spirits, when disturbed, and to keep us in the way of duty, when tempted to use any crooked courses for our relief, than to hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord. None ever followed his guidance but it ended well.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/52.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The righteous also shaIl see - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-34.htm">Psalm 37:34</a>.<p>And fear - The effect of such a judgment will be to produce reverence in the minds of good people - a solemn sense of the justice of God; to make them tremble at such fearful judgments; and to fear lest they should violate the law, and bring judgment on themselves.<p>And shall laugh at him - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>.

The idea here is not exultation in the "sufferings" of others, or joy that "calamity" has come upon them, or the gratification of selfish and revengeful feeling that an enemy is deservedly punished; it is that of approbation that punishment has come upon those who deserve it, and joy that wickedness is not allowed to triumph. It is not wrong for us to feel a sense of approbation and joy that the laws are maintained, and that justice is done, even though this does involve suffering, for we know that the guilty deserve it, and it is better that they should suffer than that the righteous should sutter through them. All this may be entirely free from any malignant, or any revengeful feeling. It may even be connected with the deepest pity, and with the purest benevolence toward the sufferers themselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/52.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. shall &#8230; fear&#8212;regard with religious awe.<p>laugh at him&#8212;for his folly;<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/52.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:<p>7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.<p>8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.<p>9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a><p>"The righteous" - the object of the tyrant's hatred - shall outlive his enmity, and "also shall see," before his own face, the end of the ungodly oppressor. God permits Mordecai to see Haman hanging on the gallows. David had brought to him the tokens of Saul's death on Gilboa. "And fear." Holy awe shall sober the mind of the good man; he shall reverently adore the God of providence. "And shall laugh at him." If not with righteous joy, yet with solemn contempt. Schemes so far-reaching all baffled, plans so deep, so politic, all thwarted. Mephistopheles outwitted, the old serpent taken in his own subtlety. This is a goodly theme for that deep-seated laughter which is more akin to solemnity than merriment.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a><p>"Lo." Look ye here, and read the epitaph of a mighty man, who lorded it proudly during his little hour, and set his heel upon the necks of the Lord's chosen. "This is the man that made not God his strength." Behold the man! The great vainglorious man. He found a fortress, but not in God; he gloried in his might, but not in the Almighty. Where is he now? How has it fared with him in the hour of his need? Behold his ruin, and be instructed. "But trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness." The substance he had gathered, and the mischiefs he had wrought, were his boast and glory. Wealth and wickedness are dreadful companions; when combined they make a monster. When the devil is master of money bags, he is a devil indeed. Beelzebub and Mammon together heat the furnace seven times hotter got the child of God, but in the end they shall work out their own destruction. Wherever we see today a man great in sin and substance, we shall do well to anticipate his end and view this verse as the divine in memoriam.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a><p>"But I," hunted and persecuted though I am, "am like a green olive tree." I am not plucked up or destroyed, but am like a flourishing olive, which out of the rock draws oil, and amid the drought still lives and grows. "In the house of God." He was one of the divine family, and could not be expelled from it; his place was near his God, and there was he safe and happy, despite all the machinations of his foes. He was bearing fruit, and would continue to do so when all his proud enemies were withered like branches lopped from the tree. "I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever." Eternal mercy is my present confidence. David knew God's mercy to be eternal and perpetual, and in that he trusted. What a rock to build on! What a fortress to fly to!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-9.htm">Psalm 52:9</a><p>"1 will praise thee for ever." Like thy mercy shall my thankfulness be. While others boast in their riches I will boast in my God; and when their glorying is silenced for ever in the tomb, my song shall continue to proclaim the lovingkindness of Jehovah. "Because thou hast done it." Thou hast vindicated the righteous, and punished the wicked. God's memorable acts of providence, both to saints and sinners, deserve and must have our gratitude. David views his prayers as already answered, the promises of God as already fulfilled, and therefore at once lifts up the sacred Psalm. "And I will wait on thy name." God shall still be the Psalmist's hope; he will not in future look elsewhere. He whose name has been so gloriously made known in truth and righteousness, is justly chosen as our expectation for years to come. "For it is good before thy saints." Before or among the saints David intended to wait, feeling it to be good both for him and them to look to the Lord alone, and wait for the manifestation of his character in due season. Men must not too much fluster us; our strength is to sit still. Let the mighty ones boast, we will wait on the Lord; and if their haste brings them present honour, our patience will have its turn by-and-by, and bring us the honour which excelleth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/52.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The righteous shall see, </span> to wit, thy remarkable downfall, and consequently shall survive thee in spite of all thy power and malice against them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fear; </span> both reverence God’s just judgment upon thee, and be afraid of provoking God to send like judgment upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall laugh at him; </span> not taking pleasure in his ruin as such, but only in the glory of God’s justice vindicated thereby, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-20.htm" title="Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her.">Revelation 18:20</a></span>, and deriding their vain and carnal confidence in their wicked courses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/52.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The righteous also shall see,....

By &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; beside &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; might be understood the priestly vegetable whole-offering, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-15.htm">Leviticus 6:15</a>. (&#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; &#1495;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, Epistle to the Hebrews, ii. 8), since every &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; as such is also &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;; but Psalm-poetry does not make any such special reference to the sacrificial tra. &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is, like &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>, an explicative addition, and the combination is like &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; &#1493;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>, &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1493;&#1514;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, and the like. A &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; (Hitzig, after the Phoenician sacrificial tables) is unknown to the Israelitish sacrificial worship. The prayer: Build Thou the walls of Jerusalem, is not inadmissible in the mouth of David; since &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; signifies not merely to build up what has been thrown down, but also to go on and finish building what is in the act of being built (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>); and, moreover, the wall built round about Jerusalem by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>) can be regarded as a fulfilment of David's prayer.<p>Nevertheless what even Theodoret has felt cannot be denied: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;...&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;. Through penitence the way of the exiles led back to Jerusalem. The supposition is very natural that vv. 20f. may be a liturgical addition made by the church of the Exile. And if the origin of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> in the time of the Exile were as indisputable as the reasons against such a position are forcible, then it would give support not merely to the derivation of vv. 20f. (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>), but of the whole Psalm, from the time of the Exile; for the general impress of the Psalm is, according to the accurate observation of Hitzig, thoroughly deutero-Isaianic. But the writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> shows signs in other respects also of the most families acquaintance with the earlier literature of the Sh&#305;&#770;r and the Mashal; and that he is none other than Isaiah reveals itself in connection with this Psalm by the echoes of this very Psalm, which are to be found not only in the second but also in the first part of the Isaianic collection of prophecy (cf. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-9.htm">Psalm 51:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>). We are therefore driven to the inference, that <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a> was a favourite Psalm of Isaiah's, and that, since the Isaianic echoes of it extend equally from the first verse to the last, it existed in the same complete form even in his day as in ours; and that consequently the close, just like the whole Psalm, so beautifully and touchingly expressed, is not the mere addition of a later age. </body></html>
