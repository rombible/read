The patience and forbearance of God are abused by sinners, to the hardening of their hearts in their wicked ways. But the enemies in vain boast in their mischief, while we have God's mercy to trust in. It will not save us from the guilt of lying, to be able to say, there was some truth in what we said, if we make it appear otherwise than it was. The more there is of craft and contrivance in any wickedness, the more there is of Satan in it. When good men die, they are transplanted from the land of the living on earth, to heaven, the garden of the Lord, where they shall take root for ever; but when wicked men die, they are rooted out, to perish for ever. The believer sees that God will destroy those who make not him their strength.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/52.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou lovest all devouring words - All words that tend to devour or "swallow up" reputation and happiness. Luther, "Thou speakest gladly all things (anything) that will serve to destruction." Anything, everything, that will serve to ruin people. The word rendered "devouring" - &#1489;&#1500;&#1506;  bela&#8219; - occurs only here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-44.htm">Jeremiah 51:44</a>, though the verb from which it is derived occurs frequently: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-12.htm">Exodus 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-1.htm">Jonah 2:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-7.htm">Genesis 41:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-24.htm">Genesis 41:24</a>, et al. The verb means to swallow; and then, to consume or destroy.<p>O thou deceitful tongue - Margin, "and the deceitful tongue." The sense is best expressed in the text.

There are words that, like boa constrictors, swallow men whole, or like lions, rend men to pieces; these words evil minds are fond of. Their oratory is evermore furious and bloody. That which will most readily provoke the lowest passions they are sure to employ, and they think such pandering to the madness of the wicked to be eloquence of a high order. "O thou deceitful tongue." Men can manage to say a great many furious things, and yet cover all over with the pretext of justice. They claim that they are jealous for the right, but the truth is they are determined to put down truth and holiness, and craftily go about it under this transparent pretence.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a><p>"God shall likewise destroy thee for ever." Fain would the persecutor destroy the church, and therefore God shall destroy him, pull down his house, pluck up his roots, and make an end of him. "He shall take thee away." God shall extinguish his coal and sweep him away like the ashes of the hearth; he would have quenched the truth, and God shall quench him. "And pluck thee out of thy dwelling place," like a plant torn from the place where it grew, or a captive dragged from his home. Ahimelech and his brother priests were cut off from their abode, and so should those be who compassed and contrived their murder. "And root thee out of the land of the living." The persecutor shall be eradicated, stubbed up by the root, cut up root and branch. He sought the death of others and death shall fall upon him. He troubled the land of the living, and he shall be banished to that land where the wicked cease from troubling. Those who will not "let live" have no right to "live." God will turn the tables on malicious men, and mete to them a portion with their own measure. "Selah."

David does not seek to lessen his guilt; he calls it in &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; by its right name, - a word which signifies blood violently shed, and then also a deed of blood and blood-guiltiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a>, and frequently).

He had given Uriah over to death in order to possess himself of Bathsheba. And the accusation of his conscience spoke not merely of adultery, but also of murder. Nevertheless the consciousness of sin no longer smites him to the earth, Mercy has lifted him up; he prays only that she would complete her work in him, then shall his tongue exultingly praise (&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503; with an accusative of the object, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-17.htm">Psalm 59:17</a>) God's righteousness, which, in accordance with the promise, takes the sinner under its protection. But in order to perform what he vowed he would do under such circumstances, he likewise needs grace, and prays, therefore, for a joyous opening of his mouth. In sacrifices God delighteth not (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>), otherwise he would bring some (&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, darem, sc. si velles, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>); whole-burnt-offerings God doth not desire: the sacrifices that are well-pleasing to Him and most beloved by Him, in comparison with which the flesh and the dead work of the &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; and the &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;) is altogether worthless, are thankfulness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>) out of the fulness of a penitent and lowly heart. There is here, directly at least, no reference to the spiritual antitype of the sin-offering, which is never called &#1494;&#1489;&#1492;. The inward part of a man is said to be broken and crushed when his sinful nature is broken, his ungodly self slain, his impenetrable hardness softened, his haughty vainglorying brought low, - in fine, when he is in himself become as nothing, and when God is everything to him. Of such a spirit and heart, panting after grace or favour, consist the sacrifices that are truly worthy God's acceptance and well-pleasing to Him (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, where such a spirit and such a heart are called God's earthly temple).<p>(Note: The Talmud finds a significance in the plural &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;. Joshua ben Levi (B. Sanhedrin 43b) says: At the time when the temple was standing, whoever brought a burnt-offering received the reward of it, and whoever brought a meat-offering, the reward of it; but the lowly was accounted by the Scriptures as one who offered every kind of sacrifice at once (&#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1499;&#1493;&#1500;&#1503;).
