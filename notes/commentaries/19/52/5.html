The patience and forbearance of God are abused by sinners, to the hardening of their hearts in their wicked ways. But the enemies in vain boast in their mischief, while we have God's mercy to trust in. It will not save us from the guilt of lying, to be able to say, there was some truth in what we said, if we make it appear otherwise than it was. The more there is of craft and contrivance in any wickedness, the more there is of Satan in it. When good men die, they are transplanted from the land of the living on earth, to heaven, the garden of the Lord, where they shall take root for ever; but when wicked men die, they are rooted out, to perish for ever. The believer sees that God will destroy those who make not him their strength.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/52.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God shall likewise destroy thee for ever - Margin, "beat thee down." The Hebrew word means to "tear, to break down, to destroy:" <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-45.htm">Leviticus 14:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-30.htm">Judges 6:30</a>. The reference here is not to the "tongue" alluded to in the previous verses, but to Doeg himself. The language in the verse is intensive and emphatic. The main idea is presented in a variety of forms, all designed to denote utter and absolute destruction - a complete and entire sweeping away, so that nothing should be left. The word "here" used would suggest the idea of "pulling down" - as a house, a fence, a wall; that is, the idea of completely "demolishing" it; and the meaning is, that destruction would come upon the informer and slanderer "like" the destruction which comes upon a house, or wall, or fence, when it is entirely pulled down.<p>He shall take thee away - An expression indicating in another form that he would be certainly destroyed. The verb used here - &#1495;&#1514;&#1492;  cha&#770;tha&#770;h - is elsewhere used only in the sense of taking up and carrying fire or coals: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a>. The idea here "may" be that he would be seized and carried away with haste, as when one takes up fire or coals, he does it as rapidly as possible, lest he should be burned.<p>And shall pluck thee out of thy dwelling-place - literally, "out of the tent." The reference is to his abode. The allusion here in the verb that is used - &#1504;&#1505;&#1495;  na&#770;sach - is to the act of pulling up plants; and the idea is, that he would be plucked up as a plant is torn from its roots.<p>And root thee out of the land of the living - As a tree is torn up from the roots and thus destroyed. He would be no more among the living. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>. All these phrases are intended to denote that such a man would be utterly destroyed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/52.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. likewise&#8212;or, "so," "also," as you have done to others God will do to you (Ps 18:27).

By &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; beside &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; might be understood the priestly vegetable whole-offering, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-15.htm">Leviticus 6:15</a>. (&#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; &#1495;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, Epistle to the Hebrews, ii. 8), since every &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; as such is also &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;; but Psalm-poetry does not make any such special reference to the sacrificial tra. &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is, like &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>, an explicative addition, and the combination is like &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; &#1493;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>, &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1493;&#1514;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, and the like. A &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; (Hitzig, after the Phoenician sacrificial tables) is unknown to the Israelitish sacrificial worship. The prayer: Build Thou the walls of Jerusalem, is not inadmissible in the mouth of David; since &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; signifies not merely to build up what has been thrown down, but also to go on and finish building what is in the act of being built (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>); and, moreover, the wall built round about Jerusalem by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>) can be regarded as a fulfilment of David's prayer.<p>Nevertheless what even Theodoret has felt cannot be denied: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;...&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;. Through penitence the way of the exiles led back to Jerusalem. The supposition is very natural that vv. 20f. may be a liturgical addition made by the church of the Exile. And if the origin of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> in the time of the Exile were as indisputable as the reasons against such a position are forcible, then it would give support not merely to the derivation of vv. 20f. (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>), but of the whole Psalm, from the time of the Exile; for the general impress of the Psalm is, according to the accurate observation of Hitzig, thoroughly deutero-Isaianic. But the writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> shows signs in other respects also of the most families acquaintance with the earlier literature of the Sh&#305;&#770;r and the Mashal; and that he is none other than Isaiah reveals itself in connection with this Psalm by the echoes of this very Psalm, which are to be found not only in the second but also in the first part of the Isaianic collection of prophecy (cf. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-9.htm">Psalm 51:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>). We are therefore driven to the inference, that <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a> was a favourite Psalm of Isaiah's, and that, since the Isaianic echoes of it extend equally from the first verse to the last, it existed in the same complete form even in his day as in ours; and that consequently the close, just like the whole Psalm, so beautifully and touchingly expressed, is not the mere addition of a later age. </body></html>
