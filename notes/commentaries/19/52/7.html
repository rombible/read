The wicked man trusted in the abundance of his riches; he thought his wickedness would help him to keep his wealth. Right or wrong, he would get what he could, and keep what he had, and ruin any one that stood in his way; this he thought would strengthen him; but see what it comes to! Those who by faith and love dwell in the house of God, shall be like green olive-trees there. And that we may be as green olive-trees, we must live a life of faith and holy confidence in God and his grace. It adds much to the beauty of our profession, and to fruitfulness in every grace, to be much in praising God; and we never can want matter for praise. His name alone can be our refuge and strong tower. It is very good for us to wait on that saving name; there is nothing better to calm and quiet our spirits, when disturbed, and to keep us in the way of duty, when tempted to use any crooked courses for our relief, than to hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord. None ever followed his guidance but it ended well.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/52.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength - That is, the righteous <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a> would say this. They would designate him as a man who had not made God his refuge, but who had trusted in his own resources. The result would be that he would he abandoned by God, and that those things on which he had relied would fail him in the day of calamity. He would be pointed out as an instance of what must occur when a man does not act with a wise reference to the will of God, but, confiding in his own strength and resources, pursues his own plans of iniquity.<p>But trusted in the abundance of his riches - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>. From this it would seem that Doeg was a rich man, and that, as a general thing, in his life, and in his plans of evil, he felt confident in his wealth. He had that spirit of arrogance and self-confidence which springs from the conscious possession of property where there is no fear of God; and into all that he did he carried the sense of his own importance as derived from his riches. In the particular matter referred to in the psalm the meaning is, that he would perform the iniquitous work of giving "information" with the proud and haughty feeling springing from wealth and from self-importance - the feeling that he was a man of consequence, and that whatever such a man might do would be entitled to special attention.<p>And strengthened himself in his wickedness - Margin, "substance." This is the same word which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-1.htm">Psalm 52:1</a> is rendered "mischief." The idea is, that he had a malicious pleasure in doing wrong, or in injuring others, and that by every art, and against all the convictions and remonstrances of his own conscience, he endeavored to confirm himself "in" this unholy purpose and employment.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/52.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. for trusting in riches and being strong in "wickedness."<p>wickedness&#8212;literally, "mischief" (Ps 52:2), instead of trusting in God.<p>the man&#8212;literally, "the mighty man," or "hero" (Ps 52:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/52.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The man:</span> these are the triumphant words of the righteous.

The Targum renders it, "that made not the Word of the Lord his strength". These are the words the righteous would say, when they should see the destruction of Doeg: see the man, the mighty man, and his end; what all his ill gotten honour and riches are come to; and what his wickedness, deceit, and cruelty, have brought upon him. The righteous make the Lord their strength, put their trust in him, in whom is everlasting strength; do all they do in his strength; fly to him as their "strong hold", as the word (b) may be rendered; thither they run, and are safe: but the rich man's wealth is his strong city, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>; there he thinks himself safe, and places his confidence in it, as follows: <p>but trusted in the abundance of his riches; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>; so the antichristian whore is represented as boasting of her riches and honour, and trusting in them, that they would always continue, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a>; like the fool in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>; <p>and strengthened himself in his wickedness; encouraged and hardened himself in sin, gave up himself to it; and, by art obstinate continuance in it, strengthened the vicious habits contracted; stretched out his hand against God, and strengthened himself against the Almighty; went on in a daring manner, promising himself impunity; and as if his wickedness was his strength, his safeguard and protection: or in his mammon, his wealth and substance; as the Targum interprets it; and so R. Saadiah Gaon (c), and with which the Syriac version agrees; and then the sense is the same with the other clause.

Doeg, who causes a massacre, not, however, by the strength of his hand, but by the cunning of his tongue, does this. Hence he is sarcastically called &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>). David's cause, however, is not therefore lost; for it is the cause of God, whose loving-kindness endures continually, without allowing itself to be affected, like the favour of men, by calumny. Concerning &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a>. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; is as usual treated as fem; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (according to the Masora with Tsere) is consequently addressed to a person. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a> &#1512;&#1506; after &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; has the Dagesh that is usual also in other instances according to the rule of the &#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;, especially in connection with the letters &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1489;&#1490;&#1491; (with which Resh is associated in the Book of Jezira, Michlol 96b, cf. 63b).<p>(Note: &#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511; is the name by which the national grammarians designate a group of two words, of which the first, ending with Kametz or Segol, has the accent on the penult., and of which the second is a monosyllable, or likewise is accented on the penult. The initial consonant of the second word in this case receives a Dagesh, in order that it may not, in consequence of the first ictus of the group of words "coming out of the distance," i.e., being far removed, be too feebly and indistinctly uttered. This dageshing, however, only takes place when the first word is already of itself Milel, or at least, as e.g., &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, had a half-accented penult., and not when it is from the very first Milra and is only become Milel by means of the retreating of the accent, as &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>. The penultima-accent has a greater lengthening force in the former case than in the latter; the following syllables are therefore uttered more rapidly in the first case, and the Dagesh is intended to guard against the third syllable being too hastily combined with the second. Concerning the rule, vid., Baer's Thorath Emeth, p. 29f.)<p>The &#1502;&#1503; or &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; and &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is not meant to affirm that he loves good, etc., less than evil, etc., but that he does not love it at all (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>). The music which comes in after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a> has to continue the accusations con amarezza without words. Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a> the singing again takes them up, by addressing the adversary with the words "thou tongue of deceit" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a>), and by reproaching him with loving only such utterances as swallow up, i.e., destroy without leaving a trace behind (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;, pausal form of &#1489;&#1500;&#1506;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-36.htm">Psalm 119:36</a>, cf. the verb in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-25.htm">Psalm 35:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-16.htm">2 Samuel 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a>.), his neighbour's life and honour and goods. Hupfeld takes <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a> as a second object; but the figurative and weaker expression would then follow the unfigurative and stronger one, and "to love a deceitful tongue" might be said with reference to this character of tongue as belonging to another person, not with reference to his own. </body></html>
