Thus, “whatever at any time may be our distress, either as a community, or as individuals, still we are to believe, still to hope, still to bless, and praise Jehovah, whose word is true, whose works are faithful, whose chastisements are mercies, and all whose promises are, in Christ Jesus, yea and amen, for evermore.” — Horne. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/89.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>89:38-52 Sometimes it is not easy to reconcile God's providences with his promises, yet we are sure that God's works fulfil his word. When the great Anointed One, Christ himself, was upon the cross, God seemed to have cast him off, yet did not make void his covenant, for that was established for ever. The honour of the house of David was lost. Thrones and crowns are often laid in the dust; but there is a crown of glory reserved for Christ's spiritual seed, which fadeth not away. From all this complaint learn what work sin makes with families, noble families, with families in which religion has appeared. They plead with God for mercy. God's unchangeableness and faithfulness assure us that He will not cast off those whom he has chosen and covenanted with. They were reproached for serving him. The scoffers of the latter days, in like manner, reproach the footsteps of the Messiah when they ask, Where is the promise of his coming? 2Pe 3:3,4. The records of the Lord's dealings with the family of David, show us his dealings with his church, and with believers. Their afflictions and distresses may be grievous, but he will not finally cast them off. Self-deceivers abuse this doctrine, and others by a careless walk bring themselves into darkness and distress; yet let the true believer rely on it for encouragement in the path of duty, and in bearing the cross. The psalm ends with praise, even after this sad complaint. Those who give God thanks for what he has done, may give him thanks for what he will do. God will follow those with his mercies, who follow him with praises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed be the Lord for evermore - Praise to God always. So Chrysostom was accustomed to say, even when driven out as an exile and a wanderer, "Blessed be God for everything." The passage here denotes entire acquiescence in God; perfect confidence in him; a belief that he was right, and faithful, and true. It is an instance of the faith which those who are truly pious have in God, in all circumstances, and at all times; of their belief that he is worthy of entire confidence, and ought always to be praised. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>. At the close of all kinds of trouble - and in the midst of all kinds of trouble - true piety will enable us to say, "Blessed be God." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/89.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>52.

In this world, and in the world to come, as the Targum; for reproaches and afflictions for Christ's sake, since they work together for good; as Job blessed the Lord in the midst of his troubles, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>, or rather the psalmist, viewing, by a spirit of prophecy, Christ rising from the dead, ascending to heaven, sitting at the right hand of God, and interceding for the application of all the blessings of the covenant; and now, seeing all before objected and complained of was reconcilable to the love, covenant, and oath of God, breaks out into this benediction, and with it closes the psalm; which agrees with Christ, not only as God over all, blessed for ever, but as Mediator, who, as such, is made most blessed for evermore; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a>. These are not the words of the copier of the Psalms, blessing God for assistance in prosecuting the work thus far, which is the sense of some Jewish writers mentioned by Aben Ezra and Kimchi, but of the psalmist himself: <p>Amen, and Amen; which words are added to express the wish and faith of the psalmist; and the word is repeated to denote the vehemence and strength of the same. Here ends the third part of the book of Psalms, and so the Syriac version closes it. See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>.

But though it is no part of the original Psalm, it is entirely in harmony with the spirit of it, as an expression of the faith which can bless God even when the visible signs of His love are withdrawn.

The plaintive question, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-47.htm">Psalm 89:47</a>, with the exception of one word, is verbatim the same as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>. The wrath to which quousque refers, makes itself to be felt, as the intensifying (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-2.htm">Psalm 13:2</a>) &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495; implies, in the intensity and duration of everlasting wrath. &#1495;&#1500;&#1491; is this temporal life which glides past secretly and unnoticed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>); and &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is not equivalent to &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; (instead of which by way of emphasis only &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; can be said), but &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1495;&#1500;&#1491; stands for &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1495;&#1500;&#1491; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; - according to the sense equivalent to &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1495;&#1491;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a>. The conjecture of Houbigant and modern expositors, &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a>), is not needed, since the inverted position of the words is just the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-48.htm">Psalm 89:48</a> it is not pointed &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, "wherefore (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-14.htm">Job 13:14</a>) hast Thou in vain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>) created?" (Hengstenberg), but &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, on account of or for what a nothing (&#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; belonging together as adjective and substantive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>) hast Thou created all the children of men? (De Wette, Hupfeld, and Hitzig). &#1506;&#1500;, of the ground of a matter and direct motive, which is better suited to the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-49.htm">Psalm 89:49</a> than the other way of taking it: the life of all men passes on into death and Hades; why then might not God, within this brief space of time, this handbreadth, manifest Himself to His creatures as the merciful and kind, and not as the always angry God? The music strikes in here, and how can it do so otherwise than in elegiac mesto? If God's justice tarries and fails in this present world, then the Old Testament faith becomes sorely tempted and tried, because it is not able to find consolation in the life beyond. Thus it is with the faith of the poet in the present juncture of affairs, the outward appearance of which is in such perplexing contradiction to the loving-kindness sworn to David and also hitherto vouchsafed. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; has not the sense in this passage of the promises of favour, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, but proofs of favour; &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; glances back at the long period of the reigns of David and of Solomon.<p>(Note: The Pasek between &#1495;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; is not designed merely to remove the limited predicate from the Lord, who is indeed the First and the Last, but also to secure its pronunciation to the guttural Aleph, which might be easily passed over after Mem; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-20.htm">Genesis 30:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>, and frequently.)<p>The Asaph <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77.htm">Psalm 77</a> and the Tephilla <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63.htm">Isaiah 63</a> contain similar complaints, just as in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a> one is reminded of the Asaph <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-2.htm">Psalm 79:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-10.htm">Psalm 79:10</a>, and in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-12.htm">Psalm 79:12</a>. The phrase &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493; is used in other instances of loving nurture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>. In this passage it must have a sense akin to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;. It is impossible on syntactic grounds to regard &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; as still dependent upon &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; (Ewald) or, as Hupfeld is fond of calling it, as a "post-liminiar" genitive. Can it be that the &#1499;&#1500; is perhaps a mutilation of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-15.htm">Ezekiel 36:15</a>, as Bttcher suggests? We do not need this conjecture. For (1) to carry any one in one's bosom, if he is an enemy, may signify: to be obliged to cherish him with the vexation proceeding from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>), without being able to get rid of him; (2) there is no doubt that &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; can, after the manner of numerals, be placed before the substantive to which it belongs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-10.htm">Ezekiel 32:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-29.htm">Proverbs 31:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-28.htm">Nehemiah 9:28</a>; cf. the other position, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>; (3) consequently &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; may signify the "totality of many peoples" just as well as &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a>. The poet complains as a member of the nation, as a citizen of the empire, that he is obliged to foster many nations in his bosom, inasmuch as the land of Israel was overwhelmed by the Egyptians and their allies, the Libyans, Troglodytes, and Ethiopians. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a> cannot now be referred back over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a> to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; (qua&#770; calumnia&#770;), and yet the relative sense, not the confirmatory (because, quoniam), is at issue. We therefore refer it to &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, and take &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; as an apposition, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-20.htm">Psalm 139:20</a> : who reproach Thee, (as) Thine enemies, Jahve, who reproach the footsteps (&#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a> with Dag. dirimens, which gives it an emotional turn) of Thine anointed, i.e., they follow him everywhere, wheresoever he may go, and whatsoever he may do. With these significant words, &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498;, the Third Book of the Psalms dies away. </body></html>
