And to praise the Lord, is to acknowledge him to be such a one that there is none like him. Surely then we should feel and express reverence when we worship God. But how little of this appears in our congregations, and how much cause have we to humble ourselves on this account! That almighty power which smote Egypt, will scatter the enemies of the church, while all who trust in God's mercy will rejoice in his name; for mercy and truth direct all he does.

To illustrate His power and faithfulness examples are cited from history. His control of the sea (the most mighty and unstable object in nature), and of Egypt (Ps 87:4), the first great foe of Israel (subjected to utter helplessness from pride and insolence), are specimens. At the same time, the whole frame of nature founded and sustained by Him, Tabor and Hermon for "east and west," and "north and south," together representing the whole world, declare the same truth as to His attributes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/89.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The fulness thereof; </span> all the creatures wherewith it is replenished, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm" title="The earth is the LORD's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.">Psalm 24:1</a> 50:12</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou hast founded them; </span> they are all thy creatures, and therefore wholly subject to thy power and pleasure; and therefore all the monarchs and kingdoms of the earth cannot hinder thee from making good thy promise to the house and kingdom of David. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/89.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The heavens are thine,....

And &#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; attaches itself to this jubilant Sela. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6-19</a> there follows a hymnic description of the exalted majesty of God, more especially of His omnipotence and faithfulness, because the value of the promise is measured by the character of the person who promises. The God of the promise is He who is praised by the heavens and the holy ones above. His way of acting is &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, of a transcendent, paradoxical, wondrous order, and as such the heavens praise it; it is praised (&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;, according to Ges. 137, 3) in the assembly of the holy ones, i.e., of the spirits in the other world, the angels (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>), for He is peerlessly exalted above the heavens and the angels. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, poetic singular instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (vid., supra on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>), which is in itself already poetical; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, not, as e.g., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, in the signification to co-ordinate, but in the medial sense: to rank with, be equal to. Concerning &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a> He is apostrophized with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; as being the One exalted above the heavens and the angels. The question "Who is as Thou?" takes its origin from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503; is not the construct form, but the principal form, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; ,&#1497;&#1491;, and is a Syriasm; for the verbal stem Syr. hs&#803;an is native to the Aramaic, in which Syr. has&#803;&#305;&#772;na&#772;'  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;. In &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, what God is is reduced to the briefest possible expression (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>). In the words, "Thy faithfulness compasseth Thee round about," the primary thought of the poet again breaks through. Such a God it is who has the faithfulness with which He fulfils all His promises, and the promises given to the house of David also, as His constant surrounding. His glory would only strike one with terror; but the faithfulness which encompasses Him softens the sunlike brilliancy of His glory, and awakens trust in so majestic a Ruler. </body></html>
