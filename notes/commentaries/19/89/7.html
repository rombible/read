And to praise the Lord, is to acknowledge him to be such a one that there is none like him. Surely then we should feel and express reverence when we worship God. But how little of this appears in our congregations, and how much cause have we to humble ourselves on this account! That almighty power which smote Egypt, will scatter the enemies of the church, while all who trust in God's mercy will rejoice in his name; for mercy and truth direct all he does. His counsels from eternity, and their consequences to eternity, are all justice and judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God is greatly to be feared - There is that in him which is suited to fill the mind with solemn feelings, and this is a proper state of mind with which to come before him. Nature teaches us that God should be approached with awe; and all the teachings of revelation confirm this. His power is to be feared; his justice is to be feared; his holiness is to be feared; and there is much also in his goodness, his benevolence, his mercy, to fill the mind with solemn emotions.<p>In the assembly of the saints - The assembly of the holy; the assembly that is convened for his worship. The reference here may be either to worshippers on earth or in heaven. Wherever, and whenever, in this world or in other worlds, creatures are engaged in the worship of God, there should be deep solemnity and reverence. On the word rendered "assembly" here - &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;  so&#770;d - a council, or assemblage for counsel, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/64-2.htm">Psalm 64:2</a>, note; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>. The idea here is founded on what is said in the previous verse, that none can be compared with God.<p>And to be had in reverence - In fear; in awe.<p>Of all them that are about him - That approach him; that are in his presence. The conscious presence of God should fill the mind with awe. When we feel that his eye is upon us, when we know that he sees us, how can we trifle and be thoughtless? How can we then be sinful? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/89.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7.

Which Jarchi and Kimchi understand of angels again, and render it "God is to be feared in the great assembly of them"; for they are a very large number, even an innumerable company, in and by whom the Lord is feared and worshipped, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-21.htm">Hebrews 12:21</a>, but rather an assembly or congregation of holy men are designed: it is the duty of such to assemble together publicly for religious worship; they ought to do it on account of the Lord, who requires it, and encourages it by his presence, he has promised; on the account of themselves, it being for their profit and pleasure; and on the account of others, for their conversion and comfort; and in imitation of the people of God, in all ages; nor should they forsake the assembling of themselves: the word rendered "assembly", signifies "counsel" or "secret"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a> and so the Targum, <p>"God is mighty in the secrets of the saints, sitting on a throne of glory;'' <p>in the assembly of the saints, the secrets of God's love are disclosed unto them; the doctrines and mysteries of his grace, called the whole counsel of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a> are there made known; and the ordinances of the Gospel, which also are styled the counsel of God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>, are there administered: now, where all this is done, <p>God is greatly feared herein; not with a slavish fear, a fear of hell and damnation, such as may be in devils; nor with an hypocritical fear, such as is taught by the precepts of men; but with a filial, godly fear, such as is peculiar to the children of God; with an holy and humble fear, with a fiducial and fearless one; with a reverential affection for the Divine Being, and such as includes all worship of him, internal and external: and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him; which the Targum paraphrases <p>"and is to be feared above all the angels that stand round about him'' <p>and so Kimchi interprets it; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>, but the same thing, in different words, is meant, as in the preceding clause. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/89.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> saints, and to be had in reverence of all <i>them that are</i> about him.</span><p>(h) If the angels tremble before God's majesty and infinite justice, what earthly creature by oppressing the Church dares to set himself against God?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/89.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in the council of the holy ones</span> (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">And to be had in reverence of all them that are about him;</span> or, <span class="accented">above all them</span>, etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/89.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet, who, as one soon observes, is a &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; (for the very beginning of the Psalm is remarkable and ingenious), begins with the confession of the inviolability of the mercies promised to the house of David, i.e., of the &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; &#1491;&#1493;&#1491; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>.<p>(Note: The Vulgate renders: Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo. The second Sunday after Easter takes its name from this rendering.)<p>God's faithful love towards the house of David, a love faithful to His promises, will he sing without ceasing, and make it known with his mouth, i.e., audibly and publicly (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-16.htm">Job 19:16</a>), to the distant posterity. Instead of &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;, we find here, and also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a>, &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; with a not merely slightly closed syllable. The Lamed of &#1500;&#1491;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1512; is, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-7.htm">Psalm 103:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-12.htm">Psalm 145:12</a>, the datival Lamed. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (lxx, Jerome, contrary to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) the poet bases his resolve upon his conviction. &#1504;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; means not so much to be upheld in building, as to be in the course of continuous building (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-23.htm">Job 22:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-15.htm">Malachi 3:15</a>, of an increasingly prosperous condition). Loving-kindness is for ever (accusative of duration) in the course of continuous building, viz., upon the unshakeable foundation of the promise of grace, inasmuch as it is fulfilled in accordance therewith. It is a building with a most solid foundation, which will not only not fall into ruins, but, adding one stone of fulfilment upon another, will rise ever higher and higher. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; then stands first as casus absol., and &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>, a pronoun having a backward reference to it. In the heavens, which are exalted above the rise and fall of things here below, God establishes His faithfulness, so that it stands fast as the sun above the earth, although the condition of things here below seems sometimes to contradict it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>). Now follow in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4-5</a> the direct words of God, the sum of the promises given to David and to his seed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, at which the poet arrives more naturally in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>. Here they are strikingly devoid of connection. It is the special substance of the promises that is associated in thought with the "loving-kindness" and "truth" of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>, which is expanded as it were appositionally therein. Hence also &#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; and &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; correspond to one another. David's seed, by virtue of divine faithfulness, has an eternally sure existence; Jahve builds up David's throne "into generation and generation," inasmuch as He causes it to rise ever fresh and vigorous, never as that which is growing old and feeble. </body></html>
