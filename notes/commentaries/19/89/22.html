David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The enemy shall not exact upon him - The literal meaning here is derived from the force sometimes used in extorting or demanding a debt, where no indulgence is shown, but where it is exacted to the last mite, whether the man is able to pay it or not. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-28.htm">Matthew 18:28</a>. Then it is used to denote oppression, or subjugation, which is the idea here. The enemy shall not be suffered to act the part of one who rigidly exacts the payment of a debt; that is, he shall not be allowed to oppress him.<p>Nor the son of wickedness afflict him - This is copied almost literally from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a>. The phrase "the son of wickedness" means simply the wicked.

The enemy is the devil, as in the interpretation of the parable of the tares, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>, the implacable enemy of Christ and his church; and yet, notwithstanding all his enmity and malice, he could not "exact", or get more inflicted on him, than the law and justice of God required of him, as the sinner's surety; or could not "exact" a tribute of him, or make him tributary to him; or, in other words, conquer him, and subject him to him: so far from it, that he was conquered by Christ, and all his principalities and powers spoiled; or could not "deceive" him, in which sense the word (b) is sometimes used; and so the Targum here: though he deceived Eve, he could not deceive the Messiah, the seed of the woman; he tried it, in person, by his temptations in the wilderness, and by his agents and instruments, the Scribes and Pharisees: but in vain, and to no purpose; he could not succeed: <p>nor the son of wickedness afflict him: at least not always: he was indeed afflicted, as by wicked men, and by Satan the wicked one, yet not so as to be overcome by any; and as Christ personal, so Christ mystical, or his church and people, are afflicted by the sons of wickedness; yet, sooner or later, they are delivered out of all their afflictions. Antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that wicked one, that is eminently so, and may be well called "the son of wickedness", has long and greatly oppressed the people of Christ, and his interest; but he shall not always; he shall be destroyed with the spirit of his mouth, and with the brightness of his coming, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>.

Blessed, then, is the people that walks in the light of His countenance. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; of a self-assured, stately walk. The words &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; are the statement of the ground of the blessing interwoven into the blessing itself: such a people has abundant cause and matter for exultation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is the festive sound of joy of the mouth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a>), and of trumpets or sackbuts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-6.htm">Psalm 27:6</a>). This confirmation of the blessing is expanded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-17.htm">Psalm 89:17-19</a>. Jahve's &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, i.e., revelation or manifestation, becomes to them a ground and object of unceasing joy; by His &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, i.e., the rigour with which He binds Himself to the relationship He has entered upon with His people and maintains it, they are exalted above abjectness and insecurity. He is &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;, the ornament of their strength, i.e., their strength which really becomes an ornament to them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a> the poet declares Israel to be this happy people. Pinsker's conjecture, &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1501; (following the Targum), destroys the transition to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>, which is formed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>. The plural reading of Kimchi and of older editions (e.g., Bomberg's), &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is incompatible with the figure; but it is immaterial whether we read &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; with the Chethb (Targum, Jerome), or with the Ker (lxx, Syriac) &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;.<p>(Note: Zur Geschichte des Karaismus, pp. &#1511;&#1508;&#1488; and &#1511;&#1508;&#1489;, according to which, reversely, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a> &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is to be read instead of &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1501;, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a> &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> &#1514;&#1513;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1514;&#1513;&#1502;&#1512;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a> &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a> &#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-27.htm">Proverbs 25:27</a> &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1501; (the limiting of our honour brings honour, - an unlikely interpretation of the &#1495;&#1511;&#1512;).)<p>&#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a> are parallel designations of the human king of Israel; &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/47-10.htm">Psalm 47:10</a>, but not in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>. For we are not compelled, with a total disregard of the limits to the possibilities of style (Ew. 310, a), to render <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>: and the Holy One of Israel, (as to Him, He) is our King (Hitzig), since we do not bring down the Psalm beyond the time of the kings. Israel's shield, Israel's king, the poet says in the holy defiant confidence of faith, is Jahve's, belongs to the Holy One of Israel, i.e., he stands as His own possession under the protection of Jahve, the Holy One, who has taken Israel to Himself for a possession; it is therefore impossible that the Davidic throne should become a prey to any worldly power. </body></html>
