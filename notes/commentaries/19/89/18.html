Though believers are nothing in themselves, yet having all in Christ Jesus, they may rejoice in his name. May the Lord enable us to do so. The joy of the Lord is the strength of his people; whereas unbelief dispirits ourselves and discourages others. Though it steals upon us under a semblance of humility, yet it is the very essence of pride. Christ is the Holy One of Israel; and in him was that peculiar people more blessed than in any other blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Lord is our defense - Margin, "Our shield is of the Lord." The original word rendered "defense," is shield. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a>, note. The meaning is, that protection was to be found in God alone. The true construction of this verse is, "For to Yahweh (belongs) our shield, and to the Holy One of Israel our king." That is, All that they had, and all that they relied on as a defense, belonged to God, or was of God; in other words, their very protectors were themselves protected by Yahweh. They had no other defense; nothing else on which they could depend. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/89.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

He who rules the raging of the sea, also rules the raging of the sea of the peoples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-8.htm">Psalm 65:8</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, a proud rising, here of the sea, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1506;, Hitzig pleasantly enough reads &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;; but &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488; is also possible so far as language is concerned, either as an infinitive  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a> (instead of &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;), or as an infinitival noun, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;, loftiness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-6.htm">Job 20:6</a>, with a likewise rejected Nun. The formation of the clause favours our taking it as a verb: when its waves rise, Thou stillest them. From the natural sea the poet comes to the sea of the peoples; and in the doings of God at the Red Sea a miraculous subjugation of both seas took place at one and the same time. It is clear from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, that Egypt is to be understood by Rahab in this passage as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>. The word signifies first of all impetuosity, violence, then a monster, like "the wild beast of the reed," <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>, i.e., the leviathan or the dragon. &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; is conjugated after the manner of the Lamed He verbs, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-20.htm">Psalm 44:20</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1500; is to be understood as describing the event or issue (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>): so that in its fall the proudly defiant kingdom is like one fatally smitten. Thereupon in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-12.htm">Psalm 89:12-15</a> again follows in the same co-ordination first the praise of God drawn from nature, then from history. Jahve's are the heavens and the earth. He is the Creator, and for that very reason the absolute owner, of both. The north and the right hand, i.e., the south, represent the earth in its entire compass from one region of the heavens to the other. Tabor on this side of the Jordan represents the west (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-1.htm">Hosea 5:1</a>), and Hermon opposite the east of the Holy Land. Both exult by reason of the name of God; by their fresh, cheerful look they give the impression of joy at the glorious revelation of the divine creative might manifest in themselves. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a> the praise again enters upon the province of history. "An arm with (&#1506;&#1501;) heroic strength," says the poet, inasmuch as he distinguishes between the attribute inherent in God and the medium of its manifestation in history. His throne has as its &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., its immovable foundation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a>), righteousness of action and right, by which all action is regulated, and which is unceasingly realized by means of the action. And mercy and truth wait upon Him. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is not; to go before any one (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-14.htm">Psalm 85:14</a>), but anticipatingly to present one's self to any one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-14.htm">Psalm 88:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-2.htm">Psalm 95:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6</a>. Mercy and truth, these two genii of sacred history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>), stand before His face like waiting servants watching upon His nod. </body></html>
