When the great Anointed One, Christ himself, was upon the cross, God seemed to have cast him off, yet did not make void his covenant, for that was established for ever. The honour of the house of David was lost. Thrones and crowns are often laid in the dust; but there is a crown of glory reserved for Christ's spiritual seed, which fadeth not away. From all this complaint learn what work sin makes with families, noble families, with families in which religion has appeared. They plead with God for mercy. God's unchangeableness and faithfulness assure us that He will not cast off those whom he has chosen and covenanted with. They were reproached for serving him. The scoffers of the latter days, in like manner, reproach the footsteps of the Messiah when they ask, Where is the promise of his coming? 2Pe 3:3,4. The records of the Lord's dealings with the family of David, show us his dealings with his church, and with believers. Their afflictions and distresses may be grievous, but he will not finally cast them off. Self-deceivers abuse this doctrine, and others by a careless walk bring themselves into darkness and distress; yet let the true believer rely on it for encouragement in the path of duty, and in bearing the cross. The psalm ends with praise, even after this sad complaint. Those who give God thanks for what he has done, may give him thanks for what he will do. God will follow those with his mercies, who follow him with praises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast made his glory to cease - Margin," brightness."

The glory of his deity, though it did not properly cease, yet it seemed to do so, being covered, and out of sight, and seen but by a very few, while he appeared in the likeness of sinful flesh; and the glory of his humanity was made to cease, in which he was fairer than the children of men, and his visage was more marred than any man's, and his form than the sons of men; and the glory of his offices, prophetical, priestly, and kingly, which were reproached and vilified, and disputed and contradicted by the Jews, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-68.htm">Matthew 26:68</a>, it may be rendered, "his purity" (b), which seemed to cease when he was clothed with our filthy garments; or had all our sins laid upon him, and imputed to him, by his Father; and he was made sin for us, who knew none: the Targum is, <p>"thou hast made the priests to cease who sprinkle upon the altar, and purify his people:'' <p>and cast his throne down to the ground; this seems contrary, and is an objection to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a>, but is not; for not withstanding the usage of Christ by the Jews, who rejected him as the King Messiah; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm">Psalm 89:39</a>, yet he is now upon the same throne with his Father, and will sit upon a throne of glory when he comes to judge the world, and so in the New Jerusalem church state, and to all eternity. <p>(b) "puritatem ejus", Montanus, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/89.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/89.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">44</span>. <span class="ital">his glory</span>] R.V. his brightness: the lustre of his kingdom.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/89.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast made his glory to cease;</span> literally, <span class="accented">thou hast put an end to his brightness</span>; but the meaning is that given in the text. <span class="cmt_word">And cast his throne down to the ground</span> (comp. ver. 39). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/89.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now after the poet has turned his thoughts towards the beginnings of the house of David which were so rich in promise, in order that he might find comfort under the sorrowful present, the contrast of the two periods is become all the more sensible to him. With &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm">Psalm 89:39</a> (And Thou - the same who hast promised and affirmed this with an oath) his Psalm takes a new turn, for which reason it might even have been &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;. &#1494;&#1504;&#1495; is used just as absolutely here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-8.htm">Psalm 77:8</a>, so that it does not require any object to be supplied out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm">Psalm 89:39</a>. &#1504;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-40.htm">Psalm 89:40</a> the lxx renders kate'strepsas; it is better rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a> &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;; for &#1504;&#1488;&#1512; is synonymous with &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;, to shake off, push away, cf. Arabic el-mena&#770;&#8219;ir, the thrusters (with the lance). &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; is a vocational name of the king as such. His crown is sacred as being the insignia of a God-bestowed office. God has therefore made the sacred thing vile by casting it to the ground (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-17.htm">Psalm 74:17</a>, to cast profaningly to the ground). The primary passage to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-41.htm">Psalm 89:41-42</a>, is <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-13.htm">Psalm 80:13</a>. "His hedges" are all the boundary and protecting fences which the land of the king has; and &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; "the fortresses" of his land (in both instances without &#1499;&#1500;, because matters have not yet come to such a pass).<p>(Note: In the list of the nations and cities conquered by King Sheshonk I are found even cities of the tribe of Issachar, e.g., Shen-ma-an, Sunem; vid., Brugsch, Reiseberichte, S. 141-145, and Blau as referred to above.)<p>In &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; the notions of the king and of the land blend together. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; are the hordes of the peoples passing through the land. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; are the neighbouring peoples that are otherwise liable to pay tribute to the house of David, who sought to take every possible advantage of that weakening of the Davidic kingdom. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-44.htm">Psalm 89:44</a> we are neither to translate "rock of his sword" (Hengstenberg), nor "O rock" (Olshausen). &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not merely signify rupes, but also from another root (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, Arab. s&#803;a&#770;r, originally of the grating or shrill noise produced by pressing and squeezing, then more particularly to cut or cut off with pressure, with a sharply set knife or the like) a knife or a blade (cf. English knife, and German kneifen, to nip): God has decreed it that the edge or blade of the sword of the king has been turned back by the enemy, that he has not been able to maintain his ground in battle (&#1492;&#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493; with e&#772; instead of &#305;&#770;, as also when the tone is not moved forward, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-45.htm">Psalm 89:45</a> the Mem of &#1502;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;, after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-41.htm">Ezekiel 16:41</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-10.htm">Ezekiel 34:10</a>, and other passages, is a preposition: cessare fecisti eum a splendore suo. A noun &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;  equals  &#1502;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512; with Dag. dirimens, <p>(Note: The view of Pinsker (Einleitung, S. 69), that this Dag. is not a sign of the doubling of the letter, but a diacritic point (that preceded the invention of the system of vowel-points), which indicated that the respective letter was to be pronounced with a Chateph vowel (e.g., mit&#803;o&#774;har), is incorrect. The doubling Dag. renders the Sheb audible, and having once become audible it readily receives this or that colouring according to the nature of its consonant and of the neighbouring vowel.)<p>like &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>, &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a> (Abulwald, Aben-Ezra, Parchon, Kimchi, and others), in itself improbable in the signification required here, is not found either in post-biblical or in biblical Hebrew. &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;, like &#1510;&#1492;&#1512;, signifies first of all not purity, but brilliancy. Still the form &#1496;&#1492;&#1512; does not lie at the basis of it in this instance; for the reading found here just happens not to be &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;, but &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;; and the reading adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer, as also by Nissel and others, so far as form is concerned is not distinct from it, viz., &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493; (mit&#803;to&#774;haro), the character of the Sheb being determined by the analogy of the  following (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a>), which presupposes the principal form &#1496;&#1492;&#1512; (Bttcher, 386, cf. supra, 2:31, note). The personal tenor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-46.htm">Psalm 89:46</a> requires that it should be referred to the then reigning Davidic king, but not as dying before his time (Olshausen), but as becoming prematurely old by reason of the sorrowful experiences of his reign. The larger half of the kingdom has been wrested from him; Egypt and the neighbouring nations also threaten the half that remains to him; and instead of the kingly robe, shame completely covers him. </body></html>
