David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Also I will make him my first-born - He shall be regarded and treated by me as the first-born son is in a family; that is, with distinguished favor and honor.

The present circumstances are a contradiction to it. The prayer to Jahve, for which the way is thus prepared, is for the removal of this contradiction. A long line, extending beyond the measure of the preceding lines, introduces the promises given to David. With &#1488;&#1494; the respective period of the past is distinctly defined. The intimate friend of Jahve (&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;) is Nathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-15.htm">1 Chronicles 17:15</a>) or David, according as we translate &#1489;&#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; "in a vision" or "by means of a vision."

The plural refers to Samuel and Nathan, for the statement brings together what was revealed to these two prophets concerning David. &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; is assistance as a gift, and that, as the designation of the person succoured by it (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a>) with &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; shows, aid in battle. &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (from &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512; in the Mishna: to ripen, to be manly or of marriageable age, distinct from &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4</a>) is a young man, adolescens: while yet a young man David was raised out of his humble lowly condition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>) high above the people. When he received the promise (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>) he had been anointed and had attained to the lordship over all Israel. Hence the preterites in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20-21</a>, which are followed by promissory futures from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-22.htm">Psalm 89:22</a> onwards. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; is fut.
