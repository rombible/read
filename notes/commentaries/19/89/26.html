We might think that the poet was referring to an actual psalm of David, with whom the expression, “My God, the rock of my salvation,” was familiar (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/18-1.htm" title="I will love you, O LORD, my strength.">Psalm 18:1-2</a>, &c.), were it not for the word “Father,” a title for the Divine Being which the national religion did not frame till the exile period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-4.htm" title="Will you not from this time cry to me, My father, you are the guide of my youth?">Jeremiah 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-19.htm" title="But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, You shall call me, My father; and shall not turn away from me.">Jeremiah 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-16.htm" title="Doubtless you are our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: you, O LORD, are our father, our redeemer; your name is from everlasting.">Isaiah 63:16</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/89.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>89:19-37 The Lord anointed David with the holy oil, not only as an emblem of the graces and gifts he received, but as a type of Christ, the King Priest, and Prophet, anointed with the Holy Ghost without measure. David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father - He shall appeal to me, or come to me as a Father, and as his only hope and defense.<p>My God - He shall come to me as God, and shall recognize me as his God, his only trust and hope.<p>And the rock of my salvation - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>.

The present circumstances are a contradiction to it. The prayer to Jahve, for which the way is thus prepared, is for the removal of this contradiction. A long line, extending beyond the measure of the preceding lines, introduces the promises given to David. With &#1488;&#1494; the respective period of the past is distinctly defined. The intimate friend of Jahve (&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;) is Nathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-15.htm">1 Chronicles 17:15</a>) or David, according as we translate &#1489;&#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; "in a vision" or "by means of a vision." But side by side with the &#1500;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498; we also find the preferable reading &#1500;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;, which is followed in the renderings of the lxx, Syriac, Vulgate, Targum, Aquila, Symmachus, and the Quarta, and is adopted by Rashi, Aben-Ezra, and others, and taken up by Heidenheim and Baer. The plural refers to Samuel and Nathan, for the statement brings together what was revealed to these two prophets concerning David. &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; is assistance as a gift, and that, as the designation of the person succoured by it (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a>) with &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; shows, aid in battle. &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (from &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512; in the Mishna: to ripen, to be manly or of marriageable age, distinct from &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4</a>) is a young man, adolescens: while yet a young man David was raised out of his humble lowly condition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>) high above the people. When he received the promise (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>) he had been anointed and had attained to the lordship over all Israel. Hence the preterites in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20-21</a>, which are followed by promissory futures from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-22.htm">Psalm 89:22</a> onwards. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; is fut.
