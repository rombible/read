When the great Anointed One, Christ himself, was upon the cross, God seemed to have cast him off, yet did not make void his covenant, for that was established for ever. The honour of the house of David was lost. Thrones and crowns are often laid in the dust; but there is a crown of glory reserved for Christ's spiritual seed, which fadeth not away. From all this complaint learn what work sin makes with families, noble families, with families in which religion has appeared. They plead with God for mercy. God's unchangeableness and faithfulness assure us that He will not cast off those whom he has chosen and covenanted with. They were reproached for serving him. The scoffers of the latter days, in like manner, reproach the footsteps of the Messiah when they ask, Where is the promise of his coming? 2Pe 3:3,4. The records of the Lord's dealings with the family of David, show us his dealings with his church, and with believers. Their afflictions and distresses may be grievous, but he will not finally cast them off. Self-deceivers abuse this doctrine, and others by a careless walk bring themselves into darkness and distress; yet let the true believer rely on it for encouragement in the path of duty, and in bearing the cross. The psalm ends with praise, even after this sad complaint. Those who give God thanks for what he has done, may give him thanks for what he will do. God will follow those with his mercies, who follow him with praises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Lord - Have reproached thee and me.

And this suits very well, both with the singular number here used, which points at one particular and eminent person anointed by God to be the king of his people, and with the matter and occasion of this Psalm. For it was universally believed by the Jews, that the Messiah should come of the seed of David, and that by him the ancient glory and power of David’s house should be revived and vastly increased. And this coming of the Messiah the Jews did continually expect for a long time together before he did come, and supported themselves therewith under all their calamities; all which being well known to many of the heathens, they reproached the Jews with the vanity of this belief and expectation.

Which carries in it another argument why the Lord should take notice of these reproaches; because they come not only from their enemies, but from his also, and the enemies of his Son, who would not have him, the King Messiah, to reign over them, and are said to reproach him in the next clause: <p>wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine Anointed; or thy Messiah; so Aben Ezra and Kimchi interpret it of the Messiah: Jarchi renders it "the ends of the Messiah"; and all of them understand it of the coming of the Messiah, as in the Talmud (d); which, because delayed, or was not so soon as expected, was scoffed at and reproached by wicked men; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>, but it rather designs the ways and works, actions, and especially the miracles of Christ, which were reproached, either as done on the sabbath day, or by the help of Satan; and he was traduced in his kindest actions to the bodies and souls of men, as a friend of publicans and sinners, and himself as a sinner: and it may have a particular view to the latter end of the Messiah, the last part of his life, his sufferings and death, and when he hung on the cross; at which time he was, in the most insolent manner, reviled and reproached by his enemies: the words may be rendered "the heels of the Messiah" (e), and are thought by some to have reference to the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, and may regard either the human nature of Christ, which was both reproached and bruised; or his members suffering disgrace and persecution for his sake, and which he takes as done to himself.

His crown is sacred as being the insignia of a God-bestowed office. God has therefore made the sacred thing vile by casting it to the ground (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-17.htm">Psalm 74:17</a>, to cast profaningly to the ground). The primary passage to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-41.htm">Psalm 89:41-42</a>, is <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-13.htm">Psalm 80:13</a>. "His hedges" are all the boundary and protecting fences which the land of the king has; and &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; "the fortresses" of his land (in both instances without &#1499;&#1500;, because matters have not yet come to such a pass).<p>(Note: In the list of the nations and cities conquered by King Sheshonk I are found even cities of the tribe of Issachar, e.g., Shen-ma-an, Sunem; vid., Brugsch, Reiseberichte, S. 141-145, and Blau as referred to above.)<p>In &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; the notions of the king and of the land blend together. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; are the hordes of the peoples passing through the land. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; are the neighbouring peoples that are otherwise liable to pay tribute to the house of David, who sought to take every possible advantage of that weakening of the Davidic kingdom. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-44.htm">Psalm 89:44</a> we are neither to translate "rock of his sword" (Hengstenberg), nor "O rock" (Olshausen). &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not merely signify rupes, but also from another root (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, Arab. s&#803;a&#770;r, originally of the grating or shrill noise produced by pressing and squeezing, then more particularly to cut or cut off with pressure, with a sharply set knife or the like) a knife or a blade (cf. English knife, and German kneifen, to nip): God has decreed it that the edge or blade of the sword of the king has been turned back by the enemy, that he has not been able to maintain his ground in battle (&#1492;&#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493; with e&#772; instead of &#305;&#770;, as also when the tone is not moved forward, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-45.htm">Psalm 89:45</a> the Mem of &#1502;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;, after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-41.htm">Ezekiel 16:41</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-10.htm">Ezekiel 34:10</a>, and other passages, is a preposition: cessare fecisti eum a splendore suo. A noun &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;  equals  &#1502;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512; with Dag. dirimens, <p>(Note: The view of Pinsker (Einleitung, S. 69), that this Dag. is not a sign of the doubling of the letter, but a diacritic point (that preceded the invention of the system of vowel-points), which indicated that the respective letter was to be pronounced with a Chateph vowel (e.g., mit&#803;o&#774;har), is incorrect. The doubling Dag. renders the Sheb audible, and having once become audible it readily receives this or that colouring according to the nature of its consonant and of the neighbouring vowel.)<p>like &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>, &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a> (Abulwald, Aben-Ezra, Parchon, Kimchi, and others), in itself improbable in the signification required here, is not found either in post-biblical or in biblical Hebrew. &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;, like &#1510;&#1492;&#1512;, signifies first of all not purity, but brilliancy. Still the form &#1496;&#1492;&#1512; does not lie at the basis of it in this instance; for the reading found here just happens not to be &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;, but &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;; and the reading adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer, as also by Nissel and others, so far as form is concerned is not distinct from it, viz., &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493; (mit&#803;to&#774;haro), the character of the Sheb being determined by the analogy of the  following (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a>), which presupposes the principal form &#1496;&#1492;&#1512; (Bttcher, 386, cf. supra, 2:31, note). The personal tenor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-46.htm">Psalm 89:46</a> requires that it should be referred to the then reigning Davidic king, but not as dying before his time (Olshausen), but as becoming prematurely old by reason of the sorrowful experiences of his reign. The larger half of the kingdom has been wrested from him; Egypt and the neighbouring nations also threaten the half that remains to him; and instead of the kingly robe, shame completely covers him. </body></html>
