David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then will I visit their transgression with the rod - They shall be punished, though my mercy shall not be wholly taken from them. God has two objects in his dealings with his backsliding and offending people;<p>(a) one is to show his displeasure at their conduct, or to punish them;<p>(b) the other is to reclaim them.<p>All who have been truly converted, or who are truly his people, will be recovered though they fall into sin; but it may be done, and will be likely to be done, in such a way as to show his own displeasure at their offences.<p>And their iniquity with stripes - The word rendercd stripes means properly a stroke, a blow; then, judgments or calamities such as God sends on mankind as a punishment for their sins. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/89.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28-37. This relation is perpetual with David's descendants, as a whole typical in official position of his last greatest descendant. Hence though in personal relations any of them might be faithless and so punished, their typical relation shall continue. His oath confirms His promise, and the most enduring objects of earth and heaven illustrate its perpetual force (Ps 72:5, 7, 17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/89.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">No text from Poole on this verse.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/89.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then will I visit their transgression with the rod,....

Nor does the promise, however, sound so definite and boundless here as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>, but it is indefinite and universal, without any need for our asking what rivers are intended by &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>, of a giving and taking possession. With &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (with retreated tone, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-63.htm">Psalm 119:63</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-125.htm">Psalm 119:125</a>) God tells with what He will answer David's filial love. Him who is the latest-born among the sons of Jesse, God makes the first-born (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;, to be early, opp. &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, to be late, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1-13</a> :21), and therefore the most favoured of the "sons of the Most High," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>. And as, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>, Israel is to be high (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) above all nations of the earth, so David, Israel's king, in whom Israel's national glory realizes itself, is made as the high one (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) with respect to the kings, i.e., above the kings, of the earth. In the person of David his seed is included; and it is that position of honour which, after having been only prelusively realized in David and Solomon, must go on being fulfilled in his seed exactly as the promise runs. The covenant with David is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a>, one that shall stand for ever. David is therefore, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a> affirms, eternal in his seed; God will make David's seed and throne &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, into eternal, i.e., into such as will abide for ever, like the days of heaven, everlasting. This description of eternal duration is, as also in Sir. 45:15, Bar. 1:11, Taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-21.htm">Deuteronomy 11:21</a>; the whole of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a> is a poetic reproduction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. </body></html>
