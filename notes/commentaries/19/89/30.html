The poet acknowledges the sin of Israel in past times, but also regards the sufferings of the exile as having been the punishment foretold by them. Hence the sin has been expiated, and the perplexity arises why Israel is still afflicted.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/89.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>89:19-37 The Lord anointed David with the holy oil, not only as an emblem of the graces and gifts he received, but as a type of Christ, the King Priest, and Prophet, anointed with the Holy Ghost without measure. David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If his children - His posterity; his successors on the throne.<p>Forsake my law - If they are not regulated by it in the administration of their government, and in their private lives.

This relation is perpetual with David's descendants, as a whole typical in official position of his last greatest descendant.

The same with the seed before mentioned, the children of the Messiah: it is not said "if he forsakes", which cannot be supposed of Christ, because he knew no sin, nor did any; which yet might be supposed of David, had he been literally meant; but not he, nor his natural children, but the spiritual seed of mystical David, are here designed, who may sin, and do sin, of which there is too much proof and evidence; and who sin not only through infirmity, but sometimes very grossly, and which sins are here expressed by various phrases: they sometimes "forsake the law of God"; do not attend to it, as they should, as the rule of their walk and conversation; are remiss in their observance of it, and obedience to it, and transgress its precepts; or his "doctrine" (h), even the doctrine of the Gospel; which may be said to be forsaken when men grow indifferent to it; go off from it in any measure, drop their profession of it, or hold it remissly, or become careless in their attendance on it: forsaking the assembling together to hear it, in some sense, is a forsaking of it; and this the Lord takes notice of, and resents, in his people: <p>and walk not in my judgments; those laws of his house by which he judges, regulates, and governs his people; by which they are directed by him, as their Judge and Lawgiver, how to behave themselves in the church of God; and in which they are to walk, and continue in the observance of; and so to do is to walk as becomes the Gospel, and worthy of their calling; but to do otherwise is to walk disorderly; and such are cognizable by the Lord, and by his people. <p>(h) "verbum meaum revelatum", Gejerus; "legem et doctrinam meam", Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/89.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/89.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30–34</span>.

Nor does the promise, however, sound so definite and boundless here as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>, but it is indefinite and universal, without any need for our asking what rivers are intended by &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>, of a giving and taking possession. With &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (with retreated tone, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-63.htm">Psalm 119:63</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-125.htm">Psalm 119:125</a>) God tells with what He will answer David's filial love. Him who is the latest-born among the sons of Jesse, God makes the first-born (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;, to be early, opp. &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, to be late, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1-13</a> :21), and therefore the most favoured of the "sons of the Most High," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>. And as, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>, Israel is to be high (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) above all nations of the earth, so David, Israel's king, in whom Israel's national glory realizes itself, is made as the high one (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) with respect to the kings, i.e., above the kings, of the earth. In the person of David his seed is included; and it is that position of honour which, after having been only prelusively realized in David and Solomon, must go on being fulfilled in his seed exactly as the promise runs. The covenant with David is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a>, one that shall stand for ever. David is therefore, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a> affirms, eternal in his seed; God will make David's seed and throne &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, into eternal, i.e., into such as will abide for ever, like the days of heaven, everlasting. This description of eternal duration is, as also in Sir. 45:15, Bar. 1:11, Taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-21.htm">Deuteronomy 11:21</a>; the whole of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a> is a poetic reproduction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. </body></html>
