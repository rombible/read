The fortress, the hard labour, the subjection as by foes riding over the vanquished, the passage through fire and water, all raise a picture of the direst tyranny.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/66.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/66-11.htm" title="You brought us into the net; you laid affliction on our loins....">Psalm 66:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou broughtest us into the net — </span>Which our enemies had laid for us, and which could never have taken or held us but by thy permission, and the disposal of thy providence, which gave us into their hands. <span class="ital">Thou hast caused men — </span>Weak, mortal, and miserable men, as the word signifies, no better nor stronger than ourselves, if thou hadst not given them power over us; <span class="ital">to ride over our heads — </span>To trample upon us, and insult over us; to abuse, nay, and make perfect slaves of us.

By afflictions we are proved, as silver in the fire. The troubles of the church will certainly end well.

See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>. The allusion here is to the efforts made by their enemies to take them, as hunters lay gins, or spread nets, to capture wild beasts. The idea here is, that those enemies had been successful; God had suffered them to fall into their hands. If we suppose this psalm to have been composed on the return from the Babylonian captivity, the propriety of this language will be apparent, for it well describes the fact that the nation had been subdued by the Babylonians, and had been led captive into a distant land. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>.<p>Thou laidst affliction upon our loins - The loins are mentioned as the seat of strength (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-11.htm">Deuteronomy 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-10.htm">1 Kings 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a>).; and the idea here is, that he had put their strength to the test; he had tried them to see how much they could bear; he had made the test effectual by applying it to the part which was able to bear most. The idea is, that he had called them to endure as much as they were able to endure. He had tried them to the utmost. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/66.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. affliction&#8212;literally, "pressure," or, as in Ps 55:3, "oppression," which, laid on the<p>loins&#8212;the seat of strength (De 33:11), enfeebles the frame.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/66.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou broughtest us into the net</span> which our enemies laid for us, and which could never have taken or held us but by the permission and disposal of thy providence, which gave us into their hands. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/66.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou broughtest us into the net,.... That is, suffered them to be taken in the net of wicked men, which they laid and spread for them; whereby they were drawn either into bad principles or bad practices, or into ruinous circumstances; though the Lord does not leave his own people there, but breaks the net or snare, sooner or later, and they escape; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>. Jarchi interprets it of a strait place, as in a prison; and which has often been literally true of the people of God, into which, though they have been cast by Satan, or by men instigated by him, yet, because permitted by the Lord, it is ascribed to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>; <p>thou laidst affliction upon our loins: the Targum renders it "a chain": the word signifies anything that is binding and pressing; it seems to be a metaphor taken from the binding of burdens upon the backs of any creatures. Afflictions often lie heavy upon the saints, are very close upon them, and press them sore, even, as they sometimes think, beyond measure; though the Lord supports them, and will not suffer them to sink under them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/66.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou broughtest us into the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.</span><p>(g) The condition of the Church is here described, which is to be led by God's providence into troubles, to be subject under tyrants, and to enter into many dangers.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/66.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Thou broughtest us into the net</span>] God had deliberately brought them into the power of their enemies, to punish them for their sins.

(borrowed apparently from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>), is called forth by contemporary manifestations of God's power, the consequences of which now lie open to view, the rendering of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>, "then will we rejoice in Him," is nevertheless unnatural, and, rightly looked at, neither grammar nor the matter requires it. For since &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; in this passage is equivalent to &#1488;&#1494;, and the future after &#1488;&#1494; takes the signification of an aorist; and since the cohortative form of the future can also (e.g., after &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/73-7.htm">Psalm 73:7</a>, and in clauses having a hypothetical sense) be referred to the past, and does sometimes at least occur where the writer throws himself back into the past (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-38.htm">2 Samuel 22:38</a>), the rendering: Then did we rejoice in Him, cannot be assailed on syntactical grounds. On the "we," cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>, Chethb, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1-14</a> :54. The church of all ages is a unity, the separate parts being jointly involved in the whole. The church here directs the attention of all the world to the mighty deeds of God at the time of the deliverance from Egypt, viz., the laying of the Red Sea and of Jordan dry, inasmuch as it can say in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-7.htm">Psalm 66:7</a>, by reason of that which it has experienced ibn the present, that the sovereign power of God is ever the same: its God rules in His victorious might &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, i.e., not "over the world," because that ought to be &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, but "in eternity" (accusative of duration, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>), and therefore, as in the former days, so also in all time to come. His eyes keep searching watch among the peoples; the rebellious, who struggle agaisnt His yoke and persecute His people, had better not rise, it may go ill with them. The Chethb runs &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, for which the Ker is &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;.

By means of &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; this proud bearing is designated as being egotistical, and as unrestrainedly boastful. Only let them not imagine themselves secure in their arrogance! There is One more exalted, whose eye nothing escapes, and to whose irresistible might whatever is not conformed to His gracious will succumbs. </body></html>
