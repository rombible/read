By afflictions we are proved, as silver in the fire. The troubles of the church will certainly end well. Through various conflicts and troubles, the slave of Satan escapes from his yoke, and obtains joy and peace in believing: through much tribulation the believer must enter into the kingdom of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/66.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which holdeth our soul in life - Margin, as in Hebrew, putteth. That is, He has put (or placed) us in a state of safety. The word rendered "in life" means literally "among the living." The word soul here is equivalent to us - ourselves; and the idea is, that he keeps us among the living. What is here said of this special deliverance is true of all people at all times, that they owe the fact that they are among the living to the care of God; or, it is because he puts them among the living, or keeps them alive.<p>And suffereth not our feet to be moved - That is, from their firm position of safety. The idea is taken from one who is walking, and who is kept from slipping or falling. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/66.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. holdeth &#8230; in life&#8212;literally, "putteth our soul in life"; that is, out of danger (Ps 30:3; 49:15).<p>to be moved&#8212;(Compare Ps 10:6; 55:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/66.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which holdeth our soul in life; </span> who by a succession of miracles of mercy hath kept us alive in the midst of a thousand deaths, to which we were exposed, and hath restored us to life, when we were like dead men, and dry bones scattered at the mouth of the grave. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To be moved, </span> to wit, so as to fall into mischief and utter ruin, as our enemies designed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/66.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Which holdeth our soul in life,.... Or, "putteth our soul in life" (b), or "among the living", which is not to be understood of infusing a living soul in man, nor of the preservation of natural life, which is common to all men; but of appointing and ordaining them unto eternal life, as the Targum; and of procuring it for them by Christ; and of implanting a principle of spiritual life in them, by his Spirit and grace; and of the preservation of the principle of life, that it be not lost; and of giving them a right and title to eternal life, and that itself: all which are a sufficient reason, and powerful argument, to bless our God, and praise his name. It follows: <p>and suffereth not our feet to be moved; that is, not to be greatly moved; or if moved so as to slip and fall, yet not so as to fall finally and totally; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>. <p>(b) "qui posuit", V.

We prefer the middle rendering: give glory as His praise, i.e., to Him as or for praise. It is unnecessary, with Hengstenberg, to render: How terrible art Thou in Thy works! in that case &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; ought not to be wanting. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; might more readily be singular (Hupfeld, Hitzig); but these forms with the softened Jod of the root dwindle down to only a few instances upon closer consideration. The singular of the predicate (what a terrible affair) here, as frequently, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a>, precedes the plural designating things. The song into which the Psalmist here bids the nations break forth, is essentially one with the song of the heavenly harpers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>., which begins, &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. </body></html>
