The Red sea, or sea of Zuph, as the Targum; by causing a strong east wind to blow, which made it dry, so that the children of Israel passed through it on dry ground, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>. Or, "he turneth" (y); for though the allusion is to the making the Red sea dry land, when the Israelites passed through it; yet it refers to something to be done in the times of Christ and the Gospel dispensation. So Christ might be said to do this literally, when he walked upon the sea of Galilee as on dry land, and enabled Peter to do so likewise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>; and figuratively, when he makes his people walk through the sea of this world, and the waters of afflictions in it, without overflowing them. He with them, bears them up, and upholds them with his right hand; so that they pass on, as on dry land, till they come safe to the shores of bliss and happiness; <p>they went through the flood on foot; or "river" (z); the river Jordan, as the Targum: for this alludes not to the passage of the Israelites through the sea, but through Jordan, when they entered into the land, of Canaan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>. The words may be rendered, according to Kimchi, <p>"they shall pass through the river on foot;'' <p>the Targum adds, <p>"the children of Israel;'' <p>so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, and Arabic versions. Such things are said in prophecy concerning the people of God in future times; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>. So the river Euphrates shall be dried up, to make way for the kings of the east, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>; <p>there did we rejoice in him; still alluding to the above cases, when Israel passed through the Red sea, and sung praise to God; and went through Jordan, and set up stones of memorial, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>. Or "there shall we rejoice in him": so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, Syriac, and Arabic versions; only the latter reads in the singular, "he shall rejoice." The Targum is, <p>"I will lead them to the mountain of his holiness, there shall we rejoice in his word:'' <p>in the essential Word, the Messiah, as the saints do rejoice in him in his house, under his word and ordinances; when they see the salvation wrought out by him, and their interest in it; the righteousness he has brought in, and themselves clothed with it; pardon procured by him, and that applied to them; and when they are favoured with a sight of him, and communion with him; so will they rejoice in him when the marriage of the Lamb is come, and the bride is ready; when antichrist shall be destroyed, and they shall have got the victory over him; then they shall stand on the sea of glass, and there shall they sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>; and when they shall have come through all their difficulties safely to heaven; there shall they rejoice in Christ, and with him to all eternity. <p>(y) "convertit", V.

The passage of the Red Sea and the crossing of the Jordan are referred to as the most notable of His terrible acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm" title="By terrible things in righteousness will you answer us, O God of our salvation; who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off on the sea:">Psalm 65:5</a>).

The Psalmist can thus identify himself and his contemporaries with the Israelites of ancient time, for he regards the nation as possessing an unbroken continuity of life. This rendering is grammatically justifiable, and it suits the context better than the alternative of R.V. marg., <span class="ital">there let us rejoice in him</span>, whether this is understood to mean, “<span class="ital">There</span>—on the spot where those old historical events occurred,—there let us take our stand, and renew our praise to Him, our wondrous Benefactor” (Kay); or, “<span class="ital">There</span>, pointing as it were to the field in which God had made bare His arm, and where the past history had been repeated in the present, <span class="ital">there</span> let us rejoice in Him” (Perowne). For the Psalmist is addressing the nations, not his countrymen, and a historical reference to the rejoicing which took place after the passage of the Red Sea is more natural than an invitation to join in celebrating either that or the recent deliverance. Moreover mention of the recent deliverance appears to be reserved for the next stanza, to which <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-7.htm" title="He rules by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.">Psalm 66:7</a></span> forms the appropriate transition. Bp. Perowne’s explanation would at any rate require the adoption of the LXX reading, ‘who turneth the sea into dry land, they go through the river on foot’; i.e. He is ever doing as He did at the Red Sea and the Jordan, opening ways of escape for His people.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot; there did we rejoice in him</span>. The passage of the Red Sea at the time of the Exodus was one of the most wonderful of God's works. To the Israelites it was altogether a matter of joy and rejoicing (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-21</a>). But how terrible a thing was it to the Egyptians! "The waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/65.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The praise of God on account of the present year's rich blessing, which He has bestowed upon the land of His people. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> God is thanked for having sent down the rain required for the ploughing (vid., Commentary on Isaiah, ii. 522) and for the increase of the seed sown, so that, as vv. 12-14 affirm, there is the prospect of a rich harvest. The harvest itself, as follows from v. 14b, is not yet housed. The whole of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> is a retrospect; in vv. 12-14 the whole is a description of the blessing standing before their eyes, which God has put upon the year now drawing to a close. Certainly, if the forms &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; were supplicatory imperatives, then the prayer for the early or seed-time rain would attach itself to the retrospect in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a>, and the standpoint would be not about the time of the Passover and Pentecost, both festivals belonging to the beginning of the harvest, but about the time of the feast of Tabernacles, the festival of thanksgiving for the harvest, and vv. 12-14 would be a glance into the future (Hitzig). But there is nothing to indicate that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> the retrospect changes into a looking forward. The poet goes on with the same theme, and also arranges the words accordingly, for which reason &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; are not to be understood in any other way. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1511; beside &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; (to enrich) signifies to cause to run over, overflow, i.e., to put anything in a state of plenty or abundance, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; (Hiph. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>, to yield in abundance), Arab, sa&#770;q, to push, impel, to cause to go on in succession and to follow in succession. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; (for which we find &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-3.htm">Psalm 62:3</a>) is an adverb, copiously, richly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-6.htm">Psalm 120:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-1.htm">Psalm 129:1</a>), like &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, a hundred times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is Hiph. with the middle syllable shortened, Ges. 53, 3, rem. 4. The fountain (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;) of God is the name given here to His inexhaustible stores of blessing, and more particularly the fulness of the waters of the heavens from which He showers down fertilizing rain. &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, "thus thoroughly," forms an alliteration with &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, to prepare, and thereby receives a peculiar twofold colouring. The meaning is: God, by raising and tending, prepared the produce of the field which the inhabitants of the land needed; for He thus thoroughly prepared the land in conformity with the fulness of His fountain, viz., by copiously watering (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; infin. absol. instead of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-12.htm">1 Samuel 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-10.htm">2 Chronicles 24:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-9.htm">Hosea 6:9</a>) the furrows of the land and pressing down, i.e., softening by means of rain, its ridges (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, defective plural, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-13.htm">Ruth 2:13</a>), which the ploughshare has made. &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; (related by root with Arab. tll, tell, a hill, prop. that which is thrown out to a place, that which is thrown up, a mound) signifies a furrow as being formed by casting up or (if from Arab. t&#817;lm, e&#769;bre&#769;cher, to make a fracture, rent, or notch in anything) by tearing into, breaking up the ground; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; (related by root with uchdu&#770;d and chat&#803;t&#803;, the usual Arabic words for a furrow<p>(Note: Frst erroneously explains &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; as a bed or strip of ground between two deep furrows, in distinction from &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; or &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>), a furrow. Beds such as we have in our potato fields are unknown to Syrian agriculture. There is a mode which may be approximately compared with it called ketif (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;), another far wider called meskeba (&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;). The Arabic tilm (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, Hebrew &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;  equals  talm), according to the Kams (as actually in Magrebinish Arabic) talam (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;), corresponds exact to our furrow, i.e., (as the Turkish Kams explains) a ditch-like fissure which the iron of the plough cuts into the field. Neshwn (i. 491) says: "The verb talam, fut. jatlum and jatlim, signifies in Jemen and in the Ghr (the land on the shore of the Red Sea) the crevices (Arab. 'l-s&#780;uqu&#770;q) which the ploughman forms, and tilm, collective plural tila&#770;m, is, in the countries mentioned, a furrow of the corn-field. Some persons pronounce the word even thilm, collective plural thila&#770;m." Thus it is at the present day universally in H&#803;aura&#770;n; in Edre&#8219;a&#770;t I heard the water-furrow of a corn-field called thilm el-kana&#770;h (Arab. t&#817;lm 'l-qna&#770;t). But this pronunciation with Arab. t&#817; is certainly not the original one, but has arisen through a substitution of the cognate and more familiar verbal stem Arab. t&#817;lm, cf. s&#780;rm, to slit (shure&#770;m, a harelip). In other parts of Syria and Palestine, also where the distinction between the sounds Arab. t and t&#817; is carefully observed, I have only heard the pronunciation tilm. - Wetzstein.))<p>as being formed by cutting into the ground.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12</a> the year in itself appears as a year of divine goodness (&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, bonitas), and the prospective blessing of harvest as the crown which is set upon it. For Thou hast crowned "the year of Thy goodness" and "with Thy goodness" are different assertions, with which also different (although kindred as to substance) ideas are associated. The futures after &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; depict its results as they now lie out to view. The chariot-tracks (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>) drop with exuberant fruitfulness, even the meadows of the uncultivated and, without rain, unproductive pasture land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26</a>.). The hills are personified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-13.htm">Psalm 65:13</a> in the manner of which Isaiah in particular is so fond (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13</a>), and which we find in the Psalms of his type (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-7.htm">Psalm 98:7</a>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-13.htm">Psalm 89:13</a>). Their fresh, verdant appearance is compared to a festive garment, with which those which previously looked bare and dreary gird themselves; and the corn to a mantle in which the valleys completely envelope themselves (&#1506;&#1496;&#1507; with the accusative, like Arab. t&#8219;t&#803;t&#803;f with b of the garment: to throw it around one, to put it on one's self). The closing words, locking themselves as it were with the beginning of the Psalm together, speak of joyous shouting and singing that continues into the present time. The meadows and valleys (Bttcher) are not the subject, of which it cannot be said that they sing; nor can the same be said of the rustling of the waving corn-fields (Kimchi). The expression requires men to be the subject, and refers to men in the widest and most general sense. Everywhere there is shouting coming up from the very depths of the breast (Hithpal.), everywhere songs of joy; for this is denoted by &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; in distinction from &#1511;&#1504;&#1503;. </body></html>
