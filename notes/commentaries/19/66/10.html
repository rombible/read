God had proved or tried them by bringing calamity upon them to test the reality of their allegiance to him. The nature of the proof or trial is referred to in the following verses.<p>Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried - That is, by being subjected to appropriate tests to ascertain its real nature, and to remove from it imperfections.

And by the experiment found them to be true and faithful; to have the truth of grace, and the root of the matter in them; not reprobate silver, or their grace counterfeit grace; but of the right kind, solid and substantial; <p>thou hast tried us as silver is tried; in a furnace, where it is put and melted by the refiner, and purified from the dross that attends it. So the Targum, <p>"thou hast purified us as the silversmith purifieth the silver;'' <p>or tries it by melting and purifying it. Thus the Lord puts his people into the furnace of afflictions, and sits as a refiner and purifier of them; hereby he tries their graces, faith, patience, hope, and love, their principles and their professions; refines their graces, and makes them more bright and illustrious; removes their dross and tin, and reforms their manners; and proves them to be good silver, and approves of them, and esteems them as such, even as his peculiar treasure. From whence it appears, as well as from the following verses, that afflictions are of God; that they are for the good of his people, and not their hurt; like silver they are put into the fire of affliction, not to be destroyed and lost, but to be purged and refined; and that they are not in wrath, but in love: and this, with what follows, may respect the sufferings of the saints under Rome, Pagan and Papal; when Christ's feet, the members of his mystical body, were like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; when their graces were tried, their works were known, and their persons proved and approved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/66.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/66.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">proved us … tried us</span>] Words used of testing precious metals, and smelting away the dross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm" title="You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.">Psalm 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-2.htm" title="Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.">Psalm 26:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-3.htm" title="The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD tries the hearts.">Proverbs 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?">Jeremiah 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm" title="And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/3-2.htm" title="But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:...">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).

We prefer the middle rendering: give glory as His praise, i.e., to Him as or for praise. It is unnecessary, with Hengstenberg, to render: How terrible art Thou in Thy works! in that case &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; ought not to be wanting. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; might more readily be singular (Hupfeld, Hitzig); but these forms with the softened Jod of the root dwindle down to only a few instances upon closer consideration. The singular of the predicate (what a terrible affair) here, as frequently, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a>, precedes the plural designating things. The song into which the Psalmist here bids the nations break forth, is essentially one with the song of the heavenly harpers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>., which begins, &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. </body></html>
