We cannot share these spiritual privileges, if we retain the love of sin in our hearts, though we refrain from the gross practice, Sin, regarded in the heart, will spoil the comfort and success of prayer; for the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the Lord. But if the feeling of sin in the heart causes desires to be rid of it; if it be the presence of one urging a demand we know we must not, cannot comply with, this is an argument of sincerity. And when we pray in simplicity and godly sincerity, our prayers will be answered. This will excite gratitude to Him who hath not turned away our prayer nor his mercy from us. It was not prayer that fetched the deliverance, but his mercy that sent it. That is the foundation of our hopes, the fountain of our comforts; and ought to be the matter of our praises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/66.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer - That is, It is fit that I should praise and adore God for the fact that he has graciously condescended to listen to the voice of my supplications.<p>Nor his mercy from me - There is no more proper ground of praise than the fact that God hears prayer - the prayer of poor, ignorant, sinful, dying men. When we consider how great is his condescension in doing this; when we think of his greatness and immensity; when we reflect that the whole universe is dependent on him, and that the farthest worlds need his care and attention; when we bear in mind that we are creatures of a day and "know nothing;" and especially when we remember how we have violated his laws, how sensual, corrupt, and vile our lives have been, how low and grovelling have been our aims and purposes, how we have provoked him by our unbelief, our ingratitude, and our hardness of heart - we can never express, in appropriate words, the extent of his goodness in hearing our prayers, nor can we find language which will properly give utterance to the praises due to his name for having condescended to listen to our cries for mercy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/66.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

It is forced to explain ‘who has not removed my prayer and His loving-kindness from me’ to mean ‘who has not deprived me of the power to pray or of the blessing of an answer’; in spite of the beauty of St Augustine’s comment: “Cum videris non a te amotam deprecationem tuam, securus esto, quia non est a te amota misericordia eius.” Possibly a verb, such as Coverdale (P. B.V.) supplies for the sake of the rhythm, has been lost; so that the clause would read, nor withdrawn his lovingkindness from me.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</span> The psalm of thanksgiving appropriately concludes with a special blessing of God by the psalmist, who felt that such especial mercy had been shown to himself (vers. 16-20). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/66.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From this point onwards the poet himself speaks, but, as the diversity and the kind of the sacrifices show, as being a member of the community at large. The &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; stand first, the girts of adoring homage; &#1489;&#1468; is the Beth of the accompaniment, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-24.htm">1 Samuel 1:24</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-25.htm">Hebrews 9:25</a>. "My vows" refer more especially to &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1475;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497; &#1504;&#1491;&#1512; also occurs elsewhere of the involuntary vowing to do extraordinary things urged from one by great distress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-35.htm">Judges 11:35</a>). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is an accusative of the object relating to the vows, quae aperuerunt  equals  aperiendo nuncupaverunt labia mea (Geier). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a> &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, used directly (like the Aramaic and Phoenician &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;) in the signification "to sacrifice" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36-41</a>, and frequently), alternates with &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, the synonym of &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;. The sacrifices to be presented are enumerated. &#1502;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; (incorrect for &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;) are marrowy, fat lambs; lambs and bullocks (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;) have the most universal appropriation among the animals that were fit for sacrifices. The ram (&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;), on the contrary, is the animal for the whole burnt-offering of the high priest, of the princes of the tribes, and of the people; and appears also as the animal for the shelamim only in connection with the shelamim of Aaron, of the people, of the princes of the tribes, and, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-14.htm">Numbers 6:14</a>, of the Nazarite. The younger he-goat (&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;) is never mentioned as an animal for the whole burnt-offering; but, indeed, as an animal for the shelamim of the princes of the tribes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a>. It is, therefore, probable that the shelamim which were to be offered in close connection with the whole burnt-offerings are introduced by &#1506;&#1501;, so that &#1511;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514; signifies the fat portions of the shelamim upon the altar smoking in the fire. The mention of "rams" renders it necessary that we should regard the poet as here comprehending himself among the people when he speaks thus. </body></html>
