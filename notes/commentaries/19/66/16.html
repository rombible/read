We cannot share these spiritual privileges, if we retain the love of sin in our hearts, though we refrain from the gross practice, Sin, regarded in the heart, will spoil the comfort and success of prayer; for the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the Lord. But if the feeling of sin in the heart causes desires to be rid of it; if it be the presence of one urging a demand we know we must not, cannot comply with, this is an argument of sincerity. And when we pray in simplicity and godly sincerity, our prayers will be answered. This will excite gratitude to Him who hath not turned away our prayer nor his mercy from us. It was not prayer that fetched the deliverance, but his mercy that sent it. That is the foundation of our hopes, the fountain of our comforts; and ought to be the matter of our praises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/66.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Come and hear, all ye that fear God - All who are true worshippers of God - the idea of fear or reverence being put for worship in general. The call is on all who truly loved God to hear what he had done, in order that he might be suitably honored, and that due praise might be given him.<p>And I will declare what he hath done for my soul - This is probably the personification of an individual to represent the people, considered as delivered from oppression and bondage. The words "for my soul" are equivalent to "for me." Literally, "for my life." The phrase would embrace all that God had done by his gracious intervention in delivering the people from bondage. The language here is such as may be used by any one who is converted to God, in reference<p>(a) to all that God has done to redeem the soul;<p>(b) to all that he has done to pardon its guilt;<p>(c) to all that he has done to give it peace and joy;<p>(d) to all that he has done to enable it to overcome sin;<p>(e) to all that he has done to give it comfort in the prospect of death;<p>(f) to all that he has done to impart thee hope of heaven.<p>The principle here is one which it is right to apply to all such cases.

With these he unites his public thanks, inviting those who fear God (Ps 60:4; 61:5, His true worshippers) to hear.

Before, they were bidden to come and see. Heating is faith's seeing. Mercy comes to us by way of ear-gate. "Hear, and your soul shall live." They saw how terrible God was, but they heard how gracious he was. "All ye that fear God." These are a fit audience when a good man is about to relate his experience; and it is well to select our hearers when inward soul matters are our theme. It is forbidden us to throw pearls before swine. We do not want to furnish wanton minds with subjects for their comedies, and therefore it Is wise to speak of personal spiritual matters where they can be understood, and not where they will be burlesqued. All God-fearing men may hear us, but far hence ye profane. "And I will declare what he hath done for my soul." I will count and recount the mercies of God to me, to my soul, my best part, my most real self. Testimonies ought to be borne by all experienced Christians, in order that the younger and feebler sort may be encouraged by the recital to put their trust in the Lord. To declare man's doings is needless; they are too trivial, and, besides, there are trumpeters enough of man's trumpery deeds; but to declare the gracious acts of God is instructive, consoling, inspiriting, and beneficial in many respects. Let each man speak for himself, for a personal witness is the surest and most forcible; second-hand experience is like "cauld kale her again;" it lacks the flavour of first-hand interest. Let no mock modesty restrain the grateful believer from speaking of himself, or rather of God's dealings to himself, for it is justly due to God; neither let him shun the individual use of the first person, which is most correct in detailing the Lord's ways of love; We must not be egotists, but we must be egotists when we bear witness for the Lord.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-17.htm">Psalm 66:17</a><p>"I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue." It Is well when prayer and praise go together, like the horses in Pharaoh's chariot. Some cry who do not sing, and some sing who do not cry: both together are best. Since the Lord's answers so frequently follow close at the heels of our petitions, and even overtake them, it becomes us to let our grateful praises keep pace with our humble prayers. Observe that the Psalmist did both cry and speak; the Lord hast cast the dumb devil out of his children, and those of them who are least fluent with their tongues are often the most eloquent with their hearts.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a><p>"If I regard iniquity in my heart." If, having seen it to be there, I continue to gaze upon it without aversion; if I cherish it, have a side glance of love towards it, excuse it, and palliate it; "The Lord will not hear me." How can he? Can I desire him to connive at my sin, and accept me while I wilfully, cling to any evil way? Nothing hinders prayer like iniquity harboured in the breast; as with Cain, so with us, sin lieth at the door, and blocks the passage. If thou listen to the devil, God will not listen to thee. If thou refusest to hear God's commands, he will surely refuse to hear thy prayers. An imperfect petition God will hear for Christ's sake, but not one which is wilfully mis-written by a traitor's hand. For God to accept our devotions, while we are delighting in sin, would be to make himself the God of hypocrites, which is a fitter name for Satan than for the Holy One of Israel.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-19.htm">Psalm 66:19</a><p>"But verily God hath heard me." Sure sign this that the petitioner was no secret lover of sin, The answer to his prayer was a fresh assurance that his heart was sincere before the Lord. See how sure the Psalmist is that he has been heard; it is with him no hope, surmise, or fancy, but he seals it with a "verily." Facts are blessed things when they reveal both God's heart as loving and our own heart as sincere. "He hath attended to the voice of my prayer." He gave his mind to consider my cries, interpreted them, accepted them, and replied to them; and therein proved his grace and also my uprightness of heart. Love of sin is a plague spot, a condemning mark, a killing sign, but those Prayers, which evidently live and prevail with God, most clearly arise from a heart which is free from dalliance with evil. Let the reader see to it, that his inmost soul be rid of all alliance with inquiry, all toleration of secret lust, or hidden wrong.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-20.htm">Psalm 66:20</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/66.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All ye that fear God; </span> whether Israelites, or Gentiles proselyted to them.

It has been because his prayers and vows proceeded from a sincere and honest heart, one which was free from "iniquity" (ver. 18). As Hengstenberg points out, this portion of the psalm is didactic, and inculcates the lesson "that there is no way of salvation except that of well doing." God, by answering the psalmist's prayer, and giving the deliverance for which he had entreated, had set his testimony to the fact of the psalmist's integrity (vers. 19, 20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come and hear, all ye that fear God.</span> The address is scarcely to all that have any sense of religion anywhere, as Professor Cheyne suggests, but rather to the religious section of his own nation - the "righteous" or "godly" of other psalms. They are invited to draw near, and be received into the psalmist's confidence. <span class="cmt_word">And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</span> What God had done for the psalmist was to give him confidence and assurance. He knew that his prayers would be ineffectual unless his heart was pure.

God has averted the peril of death and overthrow from His people: He has put their soul in life (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>), i.e., in the realm of life; He has not abandoned their foot to tottering unto overthrow (mowT the substantive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a>; cf. the reversed construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>). For God has cast His people as it were into a smelting-furnace or fining-pot in order to purify and to prove them by suffering; - this is a favourite figure with Isaiah and Jeremiah, but is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-9.htm">Ezekiel 19:9</a> is decisive concerning the meaning of &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, where &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; signifies "to bring into the holds or prisons;" besides, the figure of the fowling-net (although this is also called &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; as well as &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;) has no footing here in the context. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>) signifies specula, and that both a natural and an artificial watch-post on a mountain; here it is the mountain-hold or prison of the enemy, as a figure of the total loss of freedom. The laying on of a heavy burden mentioned by the side of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-11.htm">Psalm 66:11</a> also accords well with this. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492;, a being oppressed, the pressure of a burden, is a Hophal formation, like &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, a being spread out, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>; cf. the similar masculine forms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-6.htm">Isaiah 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>.

God so ordered it, that "wretched men" rode upon Israel's head. Or is it to be interpreted: He caused them to pass over Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>)? It can scarcely mean this, since it would then be in dorso nostro, which the Latin versions capriciously substitute. The preposition &#1500; instead of &#1506;&#1500; is used with reference to the phrase &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1500;: sitting upon Israel's head, God caused them to ride along, so that Israel was not able to raise its head freely, but was most ignominiously wounded in its self-esteem. Fire and water are, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, a figure of vicissitudes and perils of the most extreme character. Israel was nigh to being burnt up and drowned, but God led it forth &#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, to an abundant fulness, to abundance and superabundance of prosperity.
