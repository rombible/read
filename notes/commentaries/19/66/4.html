In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> God is thanked for having sent down the rain required for the ploughing (vid., Commentary on Isaiah, ii. 522) and for the increase of the seed sown, so that, as vv. 12-14 affirm, there is the prospect of a rich harvest. The harvest itself, as follows from v. 14b, is not yet housed. The whole of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> is a retrospect; in vv. 12-14 the whole is a description of the blessing standing before their eyes, which God has put upon the year now drawing to a close. Certainly, if the forms &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; were supplicatory imperatives, then the prayer for the early or seed-time rain would attach itself to the retrospect in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a>, and the standpoint would be not about the time of the Passover and Pentecost, both festivals belonging to the beginning of the harvest, but about the time of the feast of Tabernacles, the festival of thanksgiving for the harvest, and vv. 12-14 would be a glance into the future (Hitzig). But there is nothing to indicate that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> the retrospect changes into a looking forward. The poet goes on with the same theme, and also arranges the words accordingly, for which reason &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; are not to be understood in any other way. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1511; beside &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; (to enrich) signifies to cause to run over, overflow, i.e., to put anything in a state of plenty or abundance, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; (Hiph. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>, to yield in abundance), Arab, sa&#770;q, to push, impel, to cause to go on in succession and to follow in succession. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; (for which we find &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-3.htm">Psalm 62:3</a>) is an adverb, copiously, richly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-6.htm">Psalm 120:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-1.htm">Psalm 129:1</a>), like &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, a hundred times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is Hiph. with the middle syllable shortened, Ges. 53, 3, rem. 4. The fountain (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;) of God is the name given here to His inexhaustible stores of blessing, and more particularly the fulness of the waters of the heavens from which He showers down fertilizing rain. &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, "thus thoroughly," forms an alliteration with &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, to prepare, and thereby receives a peculiar twofold colouring. The meaning is: God, by raising and tending, prepared the produce of the field which the inhabitants of the land needed; for He thus thoroughly prepared the land in conformity with the fulness of His fountain, viz., by copiously watering (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; infin. absol. instead of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-12.htm">1 Samuel 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-10.htm">2 Chronicles 24:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-9.htm">Hosea 6:9</a>) the furrows of the land and pressing down, i.e., softening by means of rain, its ridges (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, defective plural, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-13.htm">Ruth 2:13</a>), which the ploughshare has made. &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; (related by root with Arab. tll, tell, a hill, prop. that which is thrown out to a place, that which is thrown up, a mound) signifies a furrow as being formed by casting up or (if from Arab. t&#817;lm, e&#769;bre&#769;cher, to make a fracture, rent, or notch in anything) by tearing into, breaking up the ground; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; (related by root with uchdu&#770;d and chat&#803;t&#803;, the usual Arabic words for a furrow<p>(Note: Frst erroneously explains &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; as a bed or strip of ground between two deep furrows, in distinction from &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; or &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>), a furrow. Beds such as we have in our potato fields are unknown to Syrian agriculture. There is a mode which may be approximately compared with it called ketif (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;), another far wider called meskeba (&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;). The Arabic tilm (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, Hebrew &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;  equals  talm), according to the Kams (as actually in Magrebinish Arabic) talam (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;), corresponds exact to our furrow, i.e., (as the Turkish Kams explains) a ditch-like fissure which the iron of the plough cuts into the field. Neshwn (i. 491) says: "The verb talam, fut. jatlum and jatlim, signifies in Jemen and in the Ghr (the land on the shore of the Red Sea) the crevices (Arab. 'l-s&#780;uqu&#770;q) which the ploughman forms, and tilm, collective plural tila&#770;m, is, in the countries mentioned, a furrow of the corn-field. Some persons pronounce the word even thilm, collective plural thila&#770;m." Thus it is at the present day universally in H&#803;aura&#770;n; in Edre&#8219;a&#770;t I heard the water-furrow of a corn-field called thilm el-kana&#770;h (Arab. t&#817;lm 'l-qna&#770;t). But this pronunciation with Arab. t&#817; is certainly not the original one, but has arisen through a substitution of the cognate and more familiar verbal stem Arab. t&#817;lm, cf. s&#780;rm, to slit (shure&#770;m, a harelip). In other parts of Syria and Palestine, also where the distinction between the sounds Arab. t and t&#817; is carefully observed, I have only heard the pronunciation tilm. - Wetzstein.))<p>as being formed by cutting into the ground.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12</a> the year in itself appears as a year of divine goodness (&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, bonitas), and the prospective blessing of harvest as the crown which is set upon it. For Thou hast crowned "the year of Thy goodness" and "with Thy goodness" are different assertions, with which also different (although kindred as to substance) ideas are associated. The futures after &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; depict its results as they now lie out to view. The chariot-tracks (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>) drop with exuberant fruitfulness, even the meadows of the uncultivated and, without rain, unproductive pasture land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26</a>.). The hills are personified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-13.htm">Psalm 65:13</a> in the manner of which Isaiah in particular is so fond (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13</a>), and which we find in the Psalms of his type (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-7.htm">Psalm 98:7</a>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-13.htm">Psalm 89:13</a>). Their fresh, verdant appearance is compared to a festive garment, with which those which previously looked bare and dreary gird themselves; and the corn to a mantle in which the valleys completely envelope themselves (&#1506;&#1496;&#1507; with the accusative, like Arab. t&#8219;t&#803;t&#803;f with b of the garment: to throw it around one, to put it on one's self). The closing words, locking themselves as it were with the beginning of the Psalm together, speak of joyous shouting and singing that continues into the present time. The meadows and valleys (Bttcher) are not the subject, of which it cannot be said that they sing; nor can the same be said of the rustling of the waving corn-fields (Kimchi). The expression requires men to be the subject, and refers to men in the widest and most general sense. Everywhere there is shouting coming up from the very depths of the breast (Hithpal.), everywhere songs of joy; for this is denoted by &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; in distinction from &#1511;&#1504;&#1503;. </body></html>
