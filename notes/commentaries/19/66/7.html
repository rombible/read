The idea is, that he does this constantly; in each age and generation. He never has ceased to rule; he never will. His dominion extends from age to age, and will stretch forward forever. The power which he evinced in delivering his people he retains now, and will retain forever. In that unchanging power, his people may confide; that unchanging power, the wicked should fear.<p>His eyes behold the nations - All nations; all people. He sees all their conduct. They can conceal nothing from him. They should, therefore, stand in awe. The wicked have much to fear from One who sees all that they do, and who has power to crush and destroy them. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>.<p>Let not the rebellious exalt themselves - Be lifted up with pride, or feel secure. They cannot overcome an Almighty God; they cannot escape from his power. The word rebellious here has reference to those who are impatient under the restraints of the law of God, and who are disposed to east off his authority. The admonition is one that may be addressed to all who thus rebel against God, whether they are nations or individuals. Alike they must feel the vengeance of his arm, and fall beneath his power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/66.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. behold the nations&#8212;watch their conduct.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/66.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The same power which God had and put forth for his people in ancient time, he still hath in as great vigour as ever, and is not at all weakened by age, and is as able and ready to act for them now as ever he was; which he hath showed by this late and glorious instance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His eyes behold the nations; </span> he sees all their secret and subtle devices, and can and will defeat them, when he sees fit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let not the rebellious exalt themselves; </span> lift up their hands against God, or against his people.

Christ is the Ruler in Israel, King over his holy hill of Zion; who must reign till all enemies are put under his feet. He rules in the kingdom of nature and providence by his power, and does whatsoever he pleases; nor can any stay his hand. He rules in the kingdom of grace, in the hearts of his people, by his efficacious grace; which makes them willing, in the day of his power, to be subject to him; and in the latter day he will take to himself his great power and reign, when he will be King for ever. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, it shall never be subverted nor usurped; nor will he in it be succeeded by another; he will reign to the end of the world, throughout the thousand years, with his saints on earth, and then with them in heaven for evermore. The Targum renders it, <p>"over the world;'' <p>over the whole world; for Christ will be King over all the earth in the latter day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>; <p>his eyes behold the nations; the antichristian states. He sees all the idolatry and wickedness committed in them; and his eyes will be as flames of fire to destroy them, when the time is come.

That are rebels against Christ, would not have him to reign over them; antichrist, who exalts himself above all that is called God, and all his followers.

We prefer the middle rendering: give glory as His praise, i.e., to Him as or for praise. It is unnecessary, with Hengstenberg, to render: How terrible art Thou in Thy works! in that case &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; ought not to be wanting. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; might more readily be singular (Hupfeld, Hitzig); but these forms with the softened Jod of the root dwindle down to only a few instances upon closer consideration. The singular of the predicate (what a terrible affair) here, as frequently, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a>, precedes the plural designating things. The song into which the Psalmist here bids the nations break forth, is essentially one with the song of the heavenly harpers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>., which begins, &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. </body></html>
