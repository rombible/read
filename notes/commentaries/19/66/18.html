What the psalmist here observes merits our deep attention. From this, and many other passages in the Old Testament, we learn that the religion of the Holy Scriptures has always been the same in substance, and that in the time when various sacrifices and divers ceremonies were enjoined, the truly pious were persuaded that sincerity of heart and purity of intention, with a conscientious care to abstain from all known sin, were things absolutely necessary in order to their pleasing God, and being acceptable in his sight: and that without these, thousands of sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and the most scrupulous observance of outward ceremonies, were of no signification before him who searches the heart, and requires truth in the inward parts.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/66.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>66:13-20 We should declare unto those that fear God, what he has done for our souls, and how he has heard and answered our prayers, inviting them to join us in prayer and praise; this will turn to our mutual comfort, and to the glory of God. We cannot share these spiritual privileges, if we retain the love of sin in our hearts, though we refrain from the gross practice, Sin, regarded in the heart, will spoil the comfort and success of prayer; for the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the Lord. But if the feeling of sin in the heart causes desires to be rid of it; if it be the presence of one urging a demand we know we must not, cannot comply with, this is an argument of sincerity. And when we pray in simplicity and godly sincerity, our prayers will be answered. This will excite gratitude to Him who hath not turned away our prayer nor his mercy from us. It was not prayer that fetched the deliverance, but his mercy that sent it. That is the foundation of our hopes, the fountain of our comforts; and ought to be the matter of our praises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/66.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I regard iniquity in my heart - literally, "If I have seen iniquity in my heart." That is, If I have indulged in a purpose of iniquity; if I have had a wicked end in view; if I have not been willing to forsake all sin; if I have cherished a purpose of pollution or wrong. The meaning is not literally, If I have "seen" any iniquity in my heart - for no one can look into his own heart, and not see that it is defiled by sin; but, If I have cherished it in my soul; if I have gloated over past sins; if I am purposing to commit sin again; if I am not willing to abandon all sin, and to be holy.<p>The Lord will not hear me - That is, He will not regard and answer my prayer. The idea is, that in order that prayer may be heard, there must be a purpose to forsake all forms of sin. This is a great and most important principle in regard to prayer. The same principle is affirmed or implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-41.htm">Psalm 18:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-29.htm">Proverbs 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-11.htm">Jeremiah 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-13.htm">Zechariah 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-31.htm">John 9:31</a>. It is also especially stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3-7</a>. The principle is applicable<p>(a) to secret purposes of sin; to sinful desires, corrupt passions. and evil propensities;<p>(b) to acts of sin in individuals, as when a man is pursuing a business founded on fraud, dishonesty, oppression, and wrong;<p>(c) to public acts of sin, as when a people fast and pray <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1-14</a>, and yet hold their fellow-men in bondage; or enact and maintain unjust and unrighteous laws; or uphold the acts of wicked rulers; or countenance and support by law that which is contrary to the law of God; and<p>(d) to the feelings of an awakened and trembling sinner when he is professedly seeking salvation.<p>If there is still the love of evil in his heart; if he has some cherished purpose of iniquity which he is not willing to abandon; if there is any one sin, however small or unimportant it may seem to be, which he is not willing to forsake, he cannot hope that God will hear his prayer; he may be assured that he will not. All prayer, to be acceptable to God, must be connected with a purpose to forsake all sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/66.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

God has averted the peril of death and overthrow from His people: He has put their soul in life (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>), i.e., in the realm of life; He has not abandoned their foot to tottering unto overthrow (mowT the substantive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a>; cf. the reversed construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>). For God has cast His people as it were into a smelting-furnace or fining-pot in order to purify and to prove them by suffering; - this is a favourite figure with Isaiah and Jeremiah, but is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-9.htm">Ezekiel 19:9</a> is decisive concerning the meaning of &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, where &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; signifies "to bring into the holds or prisons;" besides, the figure of the fowling-net (although this is also called &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; as well as &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;) has no footing here in the context. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>) signifies specula, and that both a natural and an artificial watch-post on a mountain; here it is the mountain-hold or prison of the enemy, as a figure of the total loss of freedom. The laying on of a heavy burden mentioned by the side of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-11.htm">Psalm 66:11</a> also accords well with this. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492;, a being oppressed, the pressure of a burden, is a Hophal formation, like &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, a being spread out, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>; cf. the similar masculine forms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-6.htm">Isaiah 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>.

God so ordered it, that "wretched men" rode upon Israel's head. Or is it to be interpreted: He caused them to pass over Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>)? It can scarcely mean this, since it would then be in dorso nostro, which the Latin versions capriciously substitute. The preposition &#1500; instead of &#1506;&#1500; is used with reference to the phrase &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1500;: sitting upon Israel's head, God caused them to ride along, so that Israel was not able to raise its head freely, but was most ignominiously wounded in its self-esteem. Fire and water are, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, a figure of vicissitudes and perils of the most extreme character. Israel was nigh to being burnt up and drowned, but God led it forth &#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, to an abundant fulness, to abundance and superabundance of prosperity.

Both give a stronger antithesis. But the state of straitness or oppression was indeed also a state of privation. </body></html>
