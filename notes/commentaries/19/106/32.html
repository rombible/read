An undue desire, even for lawful things, becomes sinful. God showed his displeasure for this. He filled them with uneasiness of mind, terror of conscience, and self-reproach. Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are healthful, have leanness in their souls: no love to God, no thankfulness, no appetite for the Bread of life, and then the soul must be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves, that feast their bodies and starve their souls. Even the true believer will see abundant cause to say, It is of the Lord's mercies that I am not consumed. Often have we set up idols in our hearts, cleaved to some forbidden object; so that if a greater than Moses had not stood to turn away the anger of the Lord, we should have been destroyed. If God dealt severely with Moses for unadvised words, what do those deserve who speak many proud and wicked words? It is just in God to remove those relations that are blessings to us, when we are peevish and provoking to them, and grieve their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They angered him also at the waters of strife - <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-3.htm">Numbers 20:3-13</a>. They complained of the lack of water. They wished that they had died as others had done. They murmured against God as if he could not supply their needs. They showed an unbelieving and rebellious spirit - provoking God, and tempting Moses to in act of great impatience by their conduct. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>, this is, "the waters of Meribah;" - margin, "strife." This is the meaning of the Hebrew word. The place took its name from the fact that the people there strove against the Lord and against Moses.<p>So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes - Evil came upon him. He was betrayed into impatience, and was tempted to use words which offended God, and prevented his being permitted to lead the people into the promised land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32, 33.

Will they never have done? The scene changes, but the sin continues. Aforetime they had mutinied about water when prayer would soon have turned the desert into a standing pool, but now they do it again after their former experience of the divine goodness. This made the sin a double, yea a sevenfold offence, and caused the anger of the Lord to be the more intense. "So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes." Moses was at last wearied out, and began to grow angry with them, and utterly hopeless of their ever improving; can we wonder at it, for he was man and not God? After forty years bearing with them the meek man's temper gave way, and he called them rebels, and showed unhallowed anger; and therefore he was not permitted to enter the land which he desired to inherit. Truly, he had a sight of the goodly country from the top of Pisgah, but entrance was denied him, and thus it went ill with him. It was their sin Which angered him, but he had to bear the consequences; however clear it may be that others are more guilty than ourselves, we should always remember that this will not screen us, but every man must bear his own burden.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a><p>"Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips." Which seems a small sin compared with that of others, but then it was the sin of Moses, the Lord's chosen servant, who had seen and known so much of the Lord, and therefore it could not be passed by. He did not speak blasphemously, or falsely, but only hastily and without care; but this is a serious fault in a lawgiver, and especially in one who speaks for God. This passage is to our mind one of the most terrible in the Bible. Truly we serve a jealous God. Yet he is not a hard master, or austere; we must not think so, but we must the rather be jealous of ourselves, and watch that we live the more carefully, and speak the more advisedly, because we serve such a Lord. We ought also to be very careful how we treat the ministers of the gospel, lest by provoking their spirit we should drive them into any unseemly behaviour which should bring upon them the chastisement of the Lord. Little do a murmuring, quarrelsome people dream of the perils in which they involve their pastors by their untoward behaviour. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">because of them</span>, upon occasion of their unbelief and murmuring, whereby he was provoked to speak unadvisedly, as it here follows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/106.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They angered him also at the waters of strife,....

The threat of exile is founded upon the two great threatening chapters, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>; cf. more particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> (together with the echoes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>, etc.), <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a> (together with the echoes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>, etc.). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-23.htm">Ezekiel 20:23</a> stands in a not accidental relationship to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-26.htm">Psalm 106:26</a>.; and according to that passage, &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500; is an error of the copyist for &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509; (Hitzig).<p>Now follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28-31</a> the fifth of the principal sins, viz., the taking part in the Moabitish worship of Baal. The verb &#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1491; (to be bound or chained), taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>, points to the prostitution with which Baal Per, this Moabitish Priapus, was worshipped. The sacrificial feastings in which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-2.htm">Numbers 25:2</a>, they took part, are called eating the sacrifices of the dead, because the idols are dead beings (nekroi', Wisd. 13:10-18) as opposed to God, the living One. The catena on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a> correctly interprets: &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;.<p>(Note: In the second section of Aboda zara, on the words of the Mishna: "The flesh which is intended to be offered first of all to idols is allowed, but that which comes out of the temple is forbidden, because it is like sacrifices of the dead," it is observed, fol. 32b: "Whence, said R. Jehuda ben Bethra, do I know that that which is offered to idols (&#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; &#1494;&#1512;&#1492;) pollutes like a dead body? From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28</a>. As the dead body pollutes everything that is under the same roof with it, so also does everything that is offered to idols." The Apostle Paul declares the objectivity of this pollution to be vain, cf. more particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-28.htm">1 Corinthians 10:28</a>.)<p>The object of "they made angry" is omitted; the author is fond of this, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a>.

The verb &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; is chosen with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-13.htm">Numbers 17:13</a>.

This act of zeal for Jahve, which compensated for Israel's unfaithfulness, was accounted unto him for righteousness, by his being rewarded for it with the priesthood unto everlasting ages, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-10.htm">Numbers 25:10-13</a>. This accounting of a work for righteousness is only apparently contradictory to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>.: it was indeed an act which sprang from a constancy in faith, and one which obtained for him the acceptation of a righteous man for the sake of this upon which it was based, by proving him to be such.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a> follows the sixth of the principal sins, viz., the insurrection against Moses and Aaron at the waters of strife in the fortieth year, in connection with which Moses forfeited the entrance with them into the Land of Promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-37.htm">Deuteronomy 1:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>), since he suffered himself to be carried away by the persevering obstinacy of the people against the Spirit of God (&#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; mostly providing the future for &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a>, of obstinacy against God; on &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>) into uttering the words addressed to the people, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>, in which, as the smiting of the rock which was twice repeated shows, is expressed impatience together with a tinge of unbelief. The poet distinguishes, as does the narrative in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>, between the obstinacy of the people and the transgression of Moses, which is there designated, according to that which lay at the root of it, as unbelief. The retrospective reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a> needs adjustment accordingly. </body></html>
