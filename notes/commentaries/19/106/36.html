One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of God on them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his people for his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful nature and love to his people, makes him change the course of justice into mercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case is awful when the outward church is considered. When nations professing Christianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord brings them low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance, there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalm concludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people, and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people of the earth, ere long, add their Amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they served their idols - <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-12.htm">Judges 2:12-13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-19.htm">Judges 2:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-6.htm">Judges 3:6-7</a>.<p>Which were a snare unto them - Like the snares or toils by which birds and wild beasts are caught. That is, they were taken unawares; they were in danger when they did not perceive it; they fell when they thought themselves safe. The bird and the wild beast approach the snare, unconscious of danger; so the friend of God approaches the temptations which are spread out before him by the enemy of souls - and, ere he is aware, he is a captive, and has fallen. Nothing could better describe the way in which the people of God are led into sin than the arts by which birds are caught by the fowler, and wild beasts by the hunter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34-39.

They served "their" idols, the idols of the Canaanites, who were dispossessed of their land for their idolatries and other sins; and these Israelites were put in their place. They served those which they were ordered to destroy; they who knew the true God, whose servants they were, or ought to have been, and professed to be, and were so called; and yet served the idols of the nations driven out before them. Which were a snare unto them; either the Canaanites were, who were left in the land, with whom they mixed, and whose works they learned; these ensnared them, and drew them into idolatry, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-13.htm">Joshua 23:13</a>, or the idols they worshipped, which were the cause of many evils and calamities, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>, or the act of serving and worshipping them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>.

The appellation &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-14.htm">Zechariah 7:14</a>. As to the rest, the expression is altogether Pentateuchal. "They despised the land," after <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>; "they murmured in their tents," after <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-27.htm">Deuteronomy 1:27</a>; "to lift up the land"  equals  to swear, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>; the threat &#1500;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, to make them fall down, fall away, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-32.htm">Numbers 14:32</a>. The threat of exile is founded upon the two great threatening chapters, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>; cf. more particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> (together with the echoes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>, etc.), <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a> (together with the echoes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>, etc.). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-23.htm">Ezekiel 20:23</a> stands in a not accidental relationship to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-26.htm">Psalm 106:26</a>.; and according to that passage, &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500; is an error of the copyist for &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509; (Hitzig).<p>Now follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28-31</a> the fifth of the principal sins, viz., the taking part in the Moabitish worship of Baal. The verb &#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1491; (to be bound or chained), taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>, points to the prostitution with which Baal Per, this Moabitish Priapus, was worshipped. The sacrificial feastings in which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-2.htm">Numbers 25:2</a>, they took part, are called eating the sacrifices of the dead, because the idols are dead beings (nekroi', Wisd. 13:10-18) as opposed to God, the living One. The catena on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a> correctly interprets: &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;.<p>(Note: In the second section of Aboda zara, on the words of the Mishna: "The flesh which is intended to be offered first of all to idols is allowed, but that which comes out of the temple is forbidden, because it is like sacrifices of the dead," it is observed, fol. 32b: "Whence, said R. Jehuda ben Bethra, do I know that that which is offered to idols (&#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; &#1494;&#1512;&#1492;) pollutes like a dead body? From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28</a>. As the dead body pollutes everything that is under the same roof with it, so also does everything that is offered to idols." The Apostle Paul declares the objectivity of this pollution to be vain, cf. more particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-28.htm">1 Corinthians 10:28</a>.)<p>The object of "they made angry" is omitted; the author is fond of this, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a>. The expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-29.htm">Psalm 106:29</a> is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-24.htm">Exodus 19:24</a>. The verb &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; is chosen with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-13.htm">Numbers 17:13</a>. The result is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-30.htm">Psalm 106:30</a> after <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-18.htm">Numbers 25:18</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-13.htm">Numbers 17:13</a>. With &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, to adjust, to judge adjustingly (lxx, Vulgate, correctly according to the sense, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;), the poet associates the thought of the satisfaction due to divine right, which Phinehas executed with the javelin. This act of zeal for Jahve, which compensated for Israel's unfaithfulness, was accounted unto him for righteousness, by his being rewarded for it with the priesthood unto everlasting ages, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-10.htm">Numbers 25:10-13</a>. This accounting of a work for righteousness is only apparently contradictory to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>.: it was indeed an act which sprang from a constancy in faith, and one which obtained for him the acceptation of a righteous man for the sake of this upon which it was based, by proving him to be such.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a> follows the sixth of the principal sins, viz., the insurrection against Moses and Aaron at the waters of strife in the fortieth year, in connection with which Moses forfeited the entrance with them into the Land of Promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-37.htm">Deuteronomy 1:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>), since he suffered himself to be carried away by the persevering obstinacy of the people against the Spirit of God (&#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; mostly providing the future for &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a>, of obstinacy against God; on &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>) into uttering the words addressed to the people, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>, in which, as the smiting of the rock which was twice repeated shows, is expressed impatience together with a tinge of unbelief. The poet distinguishes, as does the narrative in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>, between the obstinacy of the people and the transgression of Moses, which is there designated, according to that which lay at the root of it, as unbelief. The retrospective reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a> needs adjustment accordingly. </body></html>
