But as his purpose is to make his generation look on the Captivity as a supreme instance of this punishment, and to seek for deliverance by repentance, he mentions only the judgments inflicted by foreign foes.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>106:34-48 The conduct of the Israelites in Canaan, and God's dealings with them, show that the way of sin is down-hill; omissions make way for commissions: when they neglected to destroy the heathen, they learned their works. One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of God on them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his people for his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful nature and love to his people, makes him change the course of justice into mercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case is awful when the outward church is considered. When nations professing Christianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord brings them low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance, there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalm concludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people, and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people of the earth, ere long, add their Amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people - Anger is often compared with a fire; as we say now, a man is "inflamed" with passion.

Of course, this must be taken in a manner appropriate to God. It means that his treatment of his offending people was as if he were burning with wrath against them.<p>Insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance - He was offended with his people; he treated them "as if" they were an abomination to him. He punished them; he cast them off; he left them to the just results of their own conduct. Were ever any writers more candid and honest than the sacred penmen? There is no effort to vindicate the nation; there is no apology offered for them; there is no concealment of their guilt; there is no attempt to soften the statement in regard to the feelings of God toward them. Their conduct was abominable; they deserved the divine displeasure; they were ungrateful, evil, and rebellious; and the sacred writers do not hesitate to admit the truth of this to the fullest extent. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40-43.

Sin is the cause of wrath, which is compared to fire kindled by the breath of the Almighty, and is intolerable; this shows that the offence must be very great, as to incense the Lord against a people he had chosen above all others to be his peculiar people; as well as it was an aggravation, of their sin, so highly to provoke the Lord, whom they had vouched to be their God. There may be appearances of wrath for sin against those who are the Lord's people in the highest and best sense. <p>Insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance; the people of Israel, whom he had chosen for his inheritance, and were his portion, and the lot of his inheritance. This must be understood of the body of the people, not of every individual; not of the remnant according to the election of grace among them, of which there were some in all ages; for this would be contrary to his love, and the unchangeableness of it: and however not of the persons of his people, but of their sins; and of the appearances of his providence towards them, which look like wrath, indignation, and abhorrence; for God will not cast off his people, nor forsake his inheritance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a> the following verses explain this wrath and abhorrence.

So Jehovah’s anger was kindled against Israel, a standing formula in the Book of Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-14.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.">Jdg 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-20.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;">Jdg 2:20</a>, &c.; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-4.htm" title="For they will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy you suddenly.">Deuteronomy 7:4</a>; &c.), and he abhorred his inheritance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">40–46</span>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-34.htm">Psalm 106:34</a> the poet appeals to the command, frequently enjoined upon them from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>. onwards, to extirpate the inhabitants of Canaan. Since they did not execute this command (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>), that which it was intended to prevent came to pass: the heathen became to them a snare (mowqeesh), <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>. They intermarried with them, and fell into the Canaanitish custom in which the abominations of heathenism culminate, viz., the human sacrifice, which Jahve abhorreth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>), and only the demons (&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>) delight in. Thus then the land was defiled by blood-guiltiness (&#1495;&#1504;&#1507;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>), and they themselves became unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>) by the whoredom of idolatry. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40-43</a> the poet (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>.) sketches the alternation of apostasy, captivity, redemption, and relapse which followed upon the possession of Canaan, and more especially that which characterized the period of the judges. God's "counsel" was to make Israel free and glorious, but they leaned upon themselves, following their own intentions (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1501;); wherefore they perished in their sins. The poet uses &#1502;&#1499;&#1498; (to sink down, fall away) instead of the &#1504;&#1502;&#1511; (to moulder, rot) of the primary passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>, retained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a>, which is no blunder (Hitzig), but a deliberate change. </body></html>
