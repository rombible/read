Or the words may be meant to signify two instances of their sin. 1st, <span class="ital">They made haste — </span>So as to anticipate God’s promises in their expectations; they expected to be in Canaan presently, and, because they were not, they questioned whether they should ever be there; grew impatient, looked upon themselves as neglected, and given over to destruction, forgetting those works which were undeniable evidences of God’s wisdom, power, and goodness: and hence they quarrelled with all the difficulties which they met with in their way: <span class="ital">they waited not for his counsel — </span>They did not wait patiently and believingly upon God for such supplies from his hand, and in such manner and time as he, in his counsel, had appointed. <span class="ital">But lusted exceedingly — </span>Namely, for flesh. <span class="ital">And he gave them their request — </span>But gave it them in anger, and with a curse, for <span class="ital">he sent leanness into their souls — </span>Or, into their <span class="ital">bodies; </span>as many commentators understand the expression.

The word <span class="greekheb">נפשׁ</span>, <span class="ital">nephesh, </span>however, may be understood of the soul, properly so called; for their inordinate desire of flesh, and their eating to excess, were of course followed with uneasiness of mind, terror of conscience, and self-reproach, destructive of all confidence toward God, love to him, thankfulness for his mercies, and appetite for the bread of life; the consequence of which must, figuratively speaking, be <span class="ital">leanness of soul.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>106:13-33 Those that will not wait for God's counsel, shall justly be given up to their own hearts' lusts, to walk in their own counsels. An undue desire, even for lawful things, becomes sinful. God showed his displeasure for this. He filled them with uneasiness of mind, terror of conscience, and self-reproach. Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are healthful, have leanness in their souls: no love to God, no thankfulness, no appetite for the Bread of life, and then the soul must be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves, that feast their bodies and starve their souls. Even the true believer will see abundant cause to say, It is of the Lord's mercies that I am not consumed. Often have we set up idols in our hearts, cleaved to some forbidden object; so that if a greater than Moses had not stood to turn away the anger of the Lord, we should have been destroyed. If God dealt severely with Moses for unadvised words, what do those deserve who speak many proud and wicked words? It is just in God to remove those relations that are blessings to us, when we are peevish and provoking to them, and grieve their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They soon forgat his works - On <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-13.htm">Psalm 106:13-15</a>, see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17-22</a>.

They seemed in a hurry to get the Lord's mercies out of their memories; they hasted to be ungrateful. "They waited not for his counsel," neither waiting for the word of command or promise; eager to have their own way, and prone to trust in themselves. This is a common fault in the Lord's family to this day; we are long in learning to wait for the Lord, and upon the Lord. With him is counsel and strength, but we are vain enough to look for these to ourselves, and therefore we grievously err.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-14.htm">Psalm 106:14</a><p>"But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness." Though they would not wait God's will, they are hot to have their own. When the most suitable and pleasant food was found them in abundance, it did not please them long, but they grew dainty and sniffed at angel's food, and must needs have flesh to eat, which was unhealthy diet for that warm climate, and for their easy life. This desire of theirs they dwelt upon till it became a mania with them, and, like a wild horse, carried away its rider. For a meal of meat they were ready to curse their God and renounce the land which floweth with milk and honey. What a wonder that the Lord did not take them at their word! It is plain that they vexed him greatly, "And tempted God in the desert." In the place where they were absolutely dependent upon him and were every day fed by his direct provision, they had the presumption to provoke their God. They would have him change the plans of his wisdom, supply their sensual appetites, and work miracles to meet their wicked unbelief these things the Lord would not do, but they went as far as they could in trying to induce him to do so. They failed not in their wicked attempt because of any goodness in themselves, but because God "cannot be tempted," - temptation has no power over him, he yields not to man's threats or promises.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-15.htm">Psalm 106:15</a><p>"And he gave them their request." Prayer may be answered in anger and denied in love. That God gives a man his desire is no proof that he is the object of divine favour, everything depends upon what that desire is: "But sent leanness into their soul." Ah, that "but"! It embittered all. The meat was poison to them when it came without a blessing; whatever it might do in fattening the body, it was poor stuff when it made the soul lean. If we must know scantiness, may God grant it may not be scantiness of soul - yet this is a common attendant upon worldly prosperity. When wealth grows with many a man his worldly estate is fatter, but his soul's state is leaner. To gain silver and lose gold is a poor increase; but to win for the body and lose for the soul is far worse. How earnestly might Israel have unprayed her prayers had she known what would come with their answer! The prayers of lust will have to be wept over. We fret and fume till we have our desire, and then we have to fret still more because the attainment of it ends in bitter disappointment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Soon; </span> even within three days, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm" title="So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.">Exodus 15:22</a>,23</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They waited not for his counsel; </span> they did not wait patiently and believingly upon God for supplies from his hand, in such manner and time as he in his own counsel had appointed and thought fit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/106.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They soon forgat his works,....

Bar. 2:12), makes itself heard here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>; Israel is bearing at this time the punishment of its sins, by which it has made itself like its forefathers. In this needy and helpless condition the poet, who all along speaks as a member of the assembly, takes the way of the confession of sin, which leads to the forgiveness of sin and to the removal of the punishment of sin. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-47.htm">1 Kings 8:47</a>, signifies to be, and the Hiph. to prove one's self to be, a &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. &#1506;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a> is equivalent to aeque ac, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>. With <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a> the retrospect begins. The fathers contended with Moses and Aaron in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>), and gave no heed to the prospect of redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-9.htm">Exodus 6:9</a>). The miraculous judgments which Moses executed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>) had no more effect in bringing them to a right state of mind, and the abundant tokens of loving-kindness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>) amidst which God redeemed them made so little impression on their memories that they began to despair and to murmur even at the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11</a>.). With &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>, alternates &#1489;&#1468; (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;); cf. the alternation of prepositions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>. When they behaved thus, Jahve might have left their redemption unaccomplished, but out of unmerited mercy He nevertheless redeemed them. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-8.htm">Psalm 106:8-11</a> are closely dependent upon <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-11.htm">Psalm 106:11</a> is a transposition (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-21.htm">Psalm 34:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>) from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>. On the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a> is taken out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-13.htm">Isaiah 63:13</a> (cf. Wisd. 19:9); <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7-64:12</a> is a prayer for redemption which has a similar ground-colouring. The sea through which they passed is called, as in the T&#1508;ra, &#1497;&#1501;&#1470;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, which seems, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>, to signify the sea of reed or sedge, although the sedge does not grow in the Red Sea itself, but only on the marshy places of the coast; but it can also signify the sea of sea-weed, mare algosum, after the Egyptian sippe, wool and sea-weed (just as Arab. s&#803;u&#770;f also signifies both these). The word is certainly Egyptian, whether it is to be referred back to the Egyptian word sippe (sea-weed) or seebe (sedge), and is therefore used after the manner of a proper name; so that the inference drawn by Knobel on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18</a> from the absence of the article, that &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; is the name of a town on the northern point of the gulf, is groundless. The miracle at the sea of sedge or sea-weed - as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-12.htm">Psalm 106:12</a> says - also was not without effect. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a> tells us that they believed on Jahve and Moses His servant, and the song which they sang follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>. But they then only too quickly added sins of ingratitude. </body></html>
