We are encouraged to hope that though justly corrected, yet we shall not be utterly forsaken. God's afflicted people own themselves guilty before him.

Not for any worth or worthiness in them; not for their righteousness sake, for they were a rebellious and disobedient people; but for his name's sake, because his name was called upon them, and he was called the God of the Hebrews, as Aben Ezra observes; and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, their ancestors; to whom he had promised the land of Canaan, and was their covenant God; and because of his covenant, and of his divine perfections, and the glory of them, which were engaged to make it good; therefore he saved them, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a>. And so the spiritual Israel of God are saved, not for any superior excellencies in them, for they are in no wise better than others; nor for their righteousness sake; but to display the wisdom and faithfulness of God, his grace and mercy, his justice and holiness, power, goodness, and truth. And so here it follows; <p>that he might make his mighty power to be known; not only among the Israelites, but among the nations of the world; who, had he not saved them, might have thought, and said, that it was for want of power, and that he could not do it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/106.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Nevertheless he <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</span><p>(e) The inestimable goodness of God appears in this, that he would rather change the order of nature than have his people not be delivered, even though they were wicked.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/106.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>.

The fulness of this revelation, says <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-2.htm">Psalm 106:2</a> (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>), is inexhaustible. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; are the manifestations of His all-conquering power which makes everything subservient to His redemptive purposes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>); and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is the glory (praise or celebration) of His self-attestation in history. The proclaiming of these on the part of man can never be an exhaustive echo of them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-3.htm">Psalm 106:3</a> the poet tells what is the character of those who experience such manifestations of God; and to the assertion of the blessedness of these men he appends the petition in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-4.htm">Psalm 106:4</a>, that God would grant him a share in the experiences of the whole nation which is the object of these manifestations. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; beside &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; is a genitive of the object: with the pleasure which Thou turnest towards Thy people, i.e., when Thou again (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>) showest Thyself gracious unto them.
