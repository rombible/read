An undue desire, even for lawful things, becomes sinful. God showed his displeasure for this. He filled them with uneasiness of mind, terror of conscience, and self-reproach. Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are healthful, have leanness in their souls: no love to God, no thankfulness, no appetite for the Bread of life, and then the soul must be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves, that feast their bodies and starve their souls. Even the true believer will see abundant cause to say, It is of the Lord's mercies that I am not consumed. Often have we set up idols in our hearts, cleaved to some forbidden object; so that if a greater than Moses had not stood to turn away the anger of the Lord, we should have been destroyed. If God dealt severely with Moses for unadvised words, what do those deserve who speak many proud and wicked words? It is just in God to remove those relations that are blessings to us, when we are peevish and provoking to them, and grieve their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness - Margin, as in Hebrew, "lusted a lust."

Or, "lusted a lust" (p) as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a> to which story there related this refers; they were not content with the manna they had every day, though very nourishing and of a sweet taste; they lusted after the fish and flesh of Egypt, and other things they ate there; so that this was not a natural lust, or craving after food and drink, to satisfy nature, which would not have been criminal; but a voluptuous last to gratify their appetite: it was lusting after evil tidings, as the apostle interprets it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>, lust after sinful things, or any unlawful object, or after anything in an unlawful way, is sin. <p>And tempted God in the desert; which is expressly forbidden by a law which our Lord referred to when he was tempted by Satan in the wilderness: a very ungrateful action this, since God tempts no man to sin; a very daring impiety, a sin of the first magnitude, and which lay in making experiments, in trying whether the presence of God was among them or not; and putting God as it were on proving that he had power sufficient to provide for them in the wilderness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>. It seems it was Jesus Christ whom they tempted, from whence it appears that he is truly God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-9.htm">1 Corinthians 10:9</a>. Both in this and the preceding clause an emphasis lies on the place where all this was done, the wilderness or desert, where God had done such great things for them, and where they could not help themselves, but were wholly and immediately dependent on him. <p>(p)  "concupierunt concupiscentiam", V.

The expression is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>, where it is translated in the Authorized Version by "fell a-lusting." The lust was for "flesh," and for "the fish, the cucumbers, the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic, which they did eat in Egypt freely" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-5.htm">Numbers 11:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And tempted God in the desert</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-18.htm">Psalm 78:18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/106.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The key-note of the vidduj, which is a settled expression since <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-47.htm">1 Kings 8:47</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>, cf. Bar. 2:12), makes itself heard here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>; Israel is bearing at this time the punishment of its sins, by which it has made itself like its forefathers. In this needy and helpless condition the poet, who all along speaks as a member of the assembly, takes the way of the confession of sin, which leads to the forgiveness of sin and to the removal of the punishment of sin. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-47.htm">1 Kings 8:47</a>, signifies to be, and the Hiph. to prove one's self to be, a &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. &#1506;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a> is equivalent to aeque ac, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>. With <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a> the retrospect begins. The fathers contended with Moses and Aaron in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>), and gave no heed to the prospect of redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-9.htm">Exodus 6:9</a>). The miraculous judgments which Moses executed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>) had no more effect in bringing them to a right state of mind, and the abundant tokens of loving-kindness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>) amidst which God redeemed them made so little impression on their memories that they began to despair and to murmur even at the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11</a>.). With &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>, alternates &#1489;&#1468; (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;); cf. the alternation of prepositions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>. When they behaved thus, Jahve might have left their redemption unaccomplished, but out of unmerited mercy He nevertheless redeemed them. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-8.htm">Psalm 106:8-11</a> are closely dependent upon <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-11.htm">Psalm 106:11</a> is a transposition (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-21.htm">Psalm 34:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>) from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>. On the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a> is taken out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-13.htm">Isaiah 63:13</a> (cf. Wisd. 19:9); <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7-64:12</a> is a prayer for redemption which has a similar ground-colouring. The sea through which they passed is called, as in the T&#1508;ra, &#1497;&#1501;&#1470;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, which seems, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>, to signify the sea of reed or sedge, although the sedge does not grow in the Red Sea itself, but only on the marshy places of the coast; but it can also signify the sea of sea-weed, mare algosum, after the Egyptian sippe, wool and sea-weed (just as Arab. s&#803;u&#770;f also signifies both these). The word is certainly Egyptian, whether it is to be referred back to the Egyptian word sippe (sea-weed) or seebe (sedge), and is therefore used after the manner of a proper name; so that the inference drawn by Knobel on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18</a> from the absence of the article, that &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; is the name of a town on the northern point of the gulf, is groundless. The miracle at the sea of sedge or sea-weed - as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-12.htm">Psalm 106:12</a> says - also was not without effect. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a> tells us that they believed on Jahve and Moses His servant, and the song which they sang follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>. But they then only too quickly added sins of ingratitude. </body></html>
