One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of God on them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his people for his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful nature and love to his people, makes him change the course of justice into mercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case is awful when the outward church is considered. When nations professing Christianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord brings them low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance, there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalm concludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people, and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people of the earth, ere long, add their Amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen - From among the nations. From this it would seem that the psalm was composed when the nation was in captivity, or was dispersed among the nations that were hostile to them. The prayer is, that as God had, in former periods, recovered his people when they were in exile, or were scattered abroad, he would again graciously interpose and bring them to the land of their fathers, where they had been accustomed to worship God.<p>To give thanks unto thy holy name - Unto thee; a holy God. That we may praise thee in the place where thou art accustomed to be worshipped - in the sanctuary.<p>And to triumph in thy praise - To exult; to rejoice; to be glad in praising thee - in thy worship. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46. made &#8230; pitied&#8212;(1Ki 8:50; Da 1:9).

Here the psalmist represents the people in captivity, and represents them as praying for deliverance; as well knowing that none but God could save them: and a prayer of this nature, with respect to spiritual salvation, supposes danger, and a sense of it; that they are not able to save themselves, nor any creature able to save them; only the Lord, who is both willing and able; and of this kind is the prayer of faith. <p>And gather us from among the Heathen; in Babylon, and other countries; See Gill on the title note "Ps 106:1". <p>To give thanks unto thy holy name; bring us out of captivity to our own land, to Jerusalem, to the temple there to give thanks to thy holy name for the merciful deliverance of us; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-4.htm">Psalm 122:4</a>. <p>And to triumph in thy praise; in thy salvation, in thy wondrous works, worthy of praise; or while praising thee: the word signifies to glory therein; and such who are sensible of the mercies they receive from the Lord will make their boast of him and them, and glory; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/106.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Save us, O LORD our God, and <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, <i>and</i> to triumph in thy praise.</span><p>(a) Gather your Church which is dispersed, and give us constancy under the cross, that with one consent we may all praise you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/106.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">47</span>.

"It can scarcely be doubted," as Dean Johnson well observes, "that the words of ver. 47 refer to deliverance from the Babylonish captivity," which was the only one that involved the dispersion of the whole people, and the suspension of the liturgical offering of thanks and praise. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Save us, O Lord our God.</span> Contrast with this the "remember me" of ver. 4. The review of the national history has quickened  the psalmist's sympathies and widened them. Previously he prayed only for himself. Now it will not content him unless the people generally are "saved." <span class="cmt_word">And gather us from among the heathen.</span> (On the wide dispersion of the Israelites at the time of the Babylonian captivity, see the comment on ver. 27.) <span class="cmt_word">To give thanks unto thy holy Name, and to triumph in thy praise.</span> This is spoken of as the consequence of the gathering together. Dispersion could not, of course, prevent the rendering of praise and thanks by individual Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>); but it had stopped the united liturgical expression of them. On the restoration of the Israelites to their own land, this was resumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2-11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/106.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sins in Canaan: the failing to exterminate the idolatrous peoples and sharing in their idolatry. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-34.htm">Psalm 106:34</a> the poet appeals to the command, frequently enjoined upon them from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>. onwards, to extirpate the inhabitants of Canaan. Since they did not execute this command (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>), that which it was intended to prevent came to pass: the heathen became to them a snare (mowqeesh), <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>. They intermarried with them, and fell into the Canaanitish custom in which the abominations of heathenism culminate, viz., the human sacrifice, which Jahve abhorreth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>), and only the demons (&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>) delight in. Thus then the land was defiled by blood-guiltiness (&#1495;&#1504;&#1507;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>), and they themselves became unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>) by the whoredom of idolatry. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40-43</a> the poet (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>.) sketches the alternation of apostasy, captivity, redemption, and relapse which followed upon the possession of Canaan, and more especially that which characterized the period of the judges. God's "counsel" was to make Israel free and glorious, but they leaned upon themselves, following their own intentions (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1501;); wherefore they perished in their sins. The poet uses &#1502;&#1499;&#1498; (to sink down, fall away) instead of the &#1504;&#1502;&#1511; (to moulder, rot) of the primary passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>, retained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a>, which is no blunder (Hitzig), but a deliberate change. </body></html>
