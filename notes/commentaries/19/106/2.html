The more unworthy we are, the more is his kindness to be admired. And those who depend on the Redeemer's righteousness will endeavour to copy his example, and by word and deed to show forth his praise. God's people have reason to be cheerful people; and need not envy the children of men their pleasure or pride.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? - Who can speak the great things of God? Who can find language which will suitably express what he has done, or which will "come up" in sublimity to his acts? In other words, human language must fall immeasurably short of adequately expressing the praises of Yahweh, or conveying the fullness of what he has done. Who has not felt this when he has endeavored to praise God in a proper manner?

The fact that the cloud (&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, root &#1506;&#1503;, to meet, to present itself to view, whence the Arabic &#8219;a&#774;na&#774;n, the visible outward side of the vault of heaven) by day, and becoming like fire by night, was their guide (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), is left out of consideration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>. With &#1500;&#1502;&#1505;&#1498; we are not to associate the idea of a covering against foes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>., but of a covering from the smiting sun, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-19.htm">Exodus 40:19</a>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>., points to the idea of a canopy. In connection with the sending of the quails the tempting character of the desire is only momentarily dwelt upon, the greater emphasis is laid on the omnipotence of the divine goodness which responded to it. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is to be read instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, the w before w having been overlooked; and the Ker&#1502; writes and points &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (like &#1505;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) in order to secure the correct pronunciation, after the analogy of the plural termination &#1497;&#1493;-. The bread of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>.) is the manna. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-41.htm">Psalm 105:41</a> the giving of water out of the rock at Rephidim and at Kadesh are brought together; the expression corresponds better to the former instance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>). &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; refers to the waters, and &#1504;&#1492;&#1512; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>, is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>, an equation instead of a comparison. In this miraculous escort the patriarchal promise moves on towards its fulfilment; the holy word of promise, and the stedfast, proved faith of Abraham - these were the two motives. The second &#1488;&#1514; is, like the first, a sign of the object, not a preposition (lxx, Targum), in connection with which <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-42.htm">Psalm 105:42</a> would be a continuation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-42.htm">Psalm 105:42</a>, dragging on without any parallelism. Joy and exulting are mentioned as the mood of the redeemed ones with reference to the festive joy displayed at the Red Sea and at Sinai. By <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a> one is reminded of the same descriptions of the antitype in Isaiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>, just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-41.htm">Psalm 105:41</a> recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>. "The lands of the heathen" are the territories of the tribes of Canaan. &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; is equivalent to &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a> : the cultivated ground, the habitable cities, and the accumulated treasures. Israel entered upon the inheritance of these peoples in every direction. As an independent people upon ground that is theirs by inheritance, keeping the revealed law of their God, was Israel to exhibit the pattern of a holy nation moulded after the divine will; and, as the beginning of the Psalm shows, to unite the peoples to themselves and their God, the God of redemption, by the proclamation of the redemption which has fallen to their own lot. </body></html>
