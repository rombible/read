This interpretation of the fault of Moses is partial. A comparison of all the historical narratives shows that it was rather for a momentary lapse into the despairing spirit of the people, than for addressing them as rebels, that Moses was excluded from the Promised Land.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>106:13-33 Those that will not wait for God's counsel, shall justly be given up to their own hearts' lusts, to walk in their own counsels. An undue desire, even for lawful things, becomes sinful. God showed his displeasure for this. He filled them with uneasiness of mind, terror of conscience, and self-reproach. Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are healthful, have leanness in their souls: no love to God, no thankfulness, no appetite for the Bread of life, and then the soul must be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves, that feast their bodies and starve their souls. Even the true believer will see abundant cause to say, It is of the Lord's mercies that I am not consumed. Often have we set up idols in our hearts, cleaved to some forbidden object; so that if a greater than Moses had not stood to turn away the anger of the Lord, we should have been destroyed. If God dealt severely with Moses for unadvised words, what do those deserve who speak many proud and wicked words? It is just in God to remove those relations that are blessings to us, when we are peevish and provoking to them, and grieve their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because they provoked his spirit - literally, "They made his spirit bitter," or they embittered his soul. They threw him off his guard, so that instead of manifesting the meekness and gentleness which so eminently characterized him in general (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a>), he gave way to expressions of anger. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>.<p>So that he spake unadvisedly with his lips - Passionately; in a severe, harsh, and threatening manner. He did not bear with them as he should have done; he did not refer to God, to his power, and to his goodness as he should have done; he spake as if the whole thing depended on him and Aaron: "Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?" The word rendered "spake unadvisedly" - &#1489;&#1496;&#1488;  ba&#770;t&#803;a&#770;' - means properly to "babble;" and then, to talk idly, or unadvisedly; to utter that which has no meaning, or an improper meaning. Let us not harshly blame Moses, until we are placed in circumstances similar to his, and see how we would ourselves act. Who is there that would not have been provoked as he was, or even to a greater degree? If there are any such, let them "cast the first stone." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32, 33.

The Targum is, <p>"for they rebelled against his Holy Spirit;'' <p>the Holy Spirit of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>. Jarchi interprets it of Moses and Aaron provoking the Spirit of God; which sense is mentioned, by Aben Ezra and Kimchi; though they seem to prefer the former, and which seems best. Some interpret it of the Israelites, that they caused Moses and Aaron to provoke his Spirit. <p>So that he spake unadvisedly with his lips; that is, Moses spake, <p>saying, Hear now, ye rebels, must we, or "can we", <p>fetch you water out of this rock? Which words were spoken in an angry passionate way, calling them rebels, and expressing diffidence about getting water out of the rock; which was the thing that was so displeasing to God, because they did not believe him to sanctify him in the eyes of the children of Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-10.htm">Numbers 25:10</a>. Jarchi, as before, understands this of God, of his speaking, pronouncing, and declaring, that Moses and Aaron should not bring the congregation into the land of Canaan, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-18.htm">Numbers 25:18</a>, and so the word "unadvisedly" may be left out, and only read, "he spake with his lips"; but the other sense is to be preferred. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/106.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/106.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>.

Moses, being provoked, made his rash utterance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>). He was vexed, impatient, carried away by a gust of passion, and made the unfitting speech, "Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of the rock?" speaking as if the power were his own. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/106.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fact to which the poet refers in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-24.htm">Psalm 106:24</a>, viz., the rebellion in consequence of the report of the spies, which he brings forward as the fourth principal sin, is narrated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>. The appellation &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-14.htm">Zechariah 7:14</a>. As to the rest, the expression is altogether Pentateuchal.

The threat of exile is founded upon the two great threatening chapters, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>; cf. more particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> (together with the echoes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>, etc.), <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a> (together with the echoes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>, etc.). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-23.htm">Ezekiel 20:23</a> stands in a not accidental relationship to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-26.htm">Psalm 106:26</a>.; and according to that passage, &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500; is an error of the copyist for &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509; (Hitzig).<p>Now follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28-31</a> the fifth of the principal sins, viz., the taking part in the Moabitish worship of Baal. The verb &#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1491; (to be bound or chained), taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>, points to the prostitution with which Baal Per, this Moabitish Priapus, was worshipped. The sacrificial feastings in which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-2.htm">Numbers 25:2</a>, they took part, are called eating the sacrifices of the dead, because the idols are dead beings (nekroi', Wisd. 13:10-18) as opposed to God, the living One. The catena on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a> correctly interprets: &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;.<p>(Note: In the second section of Aboda zara, on the words of the Mishna: "The flesh which is intended to be offered first of all to idols is allowed, but that which comes out of the temple is forbidden, because it is like sacrifices of the dead," it is observed, fol. 32b: "Whence, said R. Jehuda ben Bethra, do I know that that which is offered to idols (&#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; &#1494;&#1512;&#1492;) pollutes like a dead body? From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28</a>. As the dead body pollutes everything that is under the same roof with it, so also does everything that is offered to idols." The Apostle Paul declares the objectivity of this pollution to be vain, cf. more particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-28.htm">1 Corinthians 10:28</a>.)<p>The object of "they made angry" is omitted; the author is fond of this, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a>. The expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-29.htm">Psalm 106:29</a> is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-24.htm">Exodus 19:24</a>. The verb &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; is chosen with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-13.htm">Numbers 17:13</a>. The result is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-30.htm">Psalm 106:30</a> after <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-18.htm">Numbers 25:18</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-13.htm">Numbers 17:13</a>.

This act of zeal for Jahve, which compensated for Israel's unfaithfulness, was accounted unto him for righteousness, by his being rewarded for it with the priesthood unto everlasting ages, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-10.htm">Numbers 25:10-13</a>. This accounting of a work for righteousness is only apparently contradictory to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>.: it was indeed an act which sprang from a constancy in faith, and one which obtained for him the acceptation of a righteous man for the sake of this upon which it was based, by proving him to be such.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a> follows the sixth of the principal sins, viz., the insurrection against Moses and Aaron at the waters of strife in the fortieth year, in connection with which Moses forfeited the entrance with them into the Land of Promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-37.htm">Deuteronomy 1:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>), since he suffered himself to be carried away by the persevering obstinacy of the people against the Spirit of God (&#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; mostly providing the future for &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a>, of obstinacy against God; on &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>) into uttering the words addressed to the people, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>, in which, as the smiting of the rock which was twice repeated shows, is expressed impatience together with a tinge of unbelief. The poet distinguishes, as does the narrative in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>, between the obstinacy of the people and the transgression of Moses, which is there designated, according to that which lay at the root of it, as unbelief. The retrospective reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a> needs adjustment accordingly. </body></html>
