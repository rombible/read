An undue desire, even for lawful things, becomes sinful. God showed his displeasure for this. He filled them with uneasiness of mind, terror of conscience, and self-reproach. Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are healthful, have leanness in their souls: no love to God, no thankfulness, no appetite for the Bread of life, and then the soul must be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves, that feast their bodies and starve their souls. Even the true believer will see abundant cause to say, It is of the Lord's mercies that I am not consumed. Often have we set up idols in our hearts, cleaved to some forbidden object; so that if a greater than Moses had not stood to turn away the anger of the Lord, we should have been destroyed. If God dealt severely with Moses for unadvised words, what do those deserve who speak many proud and wicked words? It is just in God to remove those relations that are blessings to us, when we are peevish and provoking to them, and grieve their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They forgat God their Saviour ... - The God who had saved, or delivered them, out of Egypt.

They would have made an ox or bull, but their idol turned out but a calf; an imitation of the divine symbols, the cherubim; or of the sacred bull of Egyptian idolatry. The idolatry was more sinful in view of their recent experience of God's power in Egypt and His wonders at Sinai (Ex 32:1-6). Though intending to worship Jehovah under the symbol of the calf, yet as this was incompatible with His nature (De 4:15-17), they in reality gave up Him, and so were given up by Him. Instead of the Lord of heaven, they had as their glory the image of an ox that does nothing but eat grass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/106.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wondrous works in the land of Ham,....

For what <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-13.htm">Psalm 106:13</a> places foremost was the root of the whole evil, that, falling away from faith in God's promise, they forgot the works of God which had been wrought in confirmation of it, and did not wait for the carrying out of His counsel. The poet has before his eye the murmuring for water on the third day after the miraculous deliverance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22-24</a>) and in Rephidim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2</a>). Then the murmuring for flesh in the first and second years of the exodus which was followed by the sending of the quails (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>), together with the wrathful judgment by which the murmuring for the second time was punished (Kibro&#770;th ha-Ta'avah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33-35</a>). This dispensation of wrath the poet calls &#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; (lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac erroneously &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, perhaps &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, nourishment), inasmuch as he interprets <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33-35</a> of a wasting disease, which swept away the people in consequence of eating inordinately of the flesh, and in the expression (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-31.htm">Psalm 78:31</a>) he closely follows <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>.

The poet has <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a> in his eye. The rebellious ones were swallowed up by the earth, and their two hundred and fifty noble, non-Levite partisans consumed by fire. The fact that the poet does not mention Korah among those who were swallowed up is in perfect harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-25.htm">Numbers 16:25</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>; cf. however <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-10.htm">Numbers 26:10</a>.

The poet here glances back at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, but not without at the same time having <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8-12</a> in his mind; for the expression "in Horeb" is Deuteronomic, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2</a>, and frequently. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-20.htm">Psalm 106:20</a> is also based upon the Book of Deuteronomy: they exchanged their glory, i.e., the God who was their distinction before all peoples according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>), for the likeness (&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;) of a plough-ox (for this is pre-eminently called &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, in the dialects &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;), contrary to the prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-17.htm">Deuteronomy 4:17</a>.
