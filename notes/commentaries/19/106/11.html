We are encouraged to hope that though justly corrected, yet we shall not be utterly forsaken. God's afflicted people own themselves guilty before him. God is distrusted because his favours are not remembered. If he did not save us for his own name's sake, and to the praise of his power and grace, we should all perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the waters covered their enemies ... - <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-5.htm">Exodus 15:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. rebuked&#8212;(Ps 104:7).<p>as through the wilderness&#8212;(Isa 63:11-14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/106.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the waters covered their enemies,....

The lxx appropriately renders &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; by &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, for God is called "good" not so much in respect of His nature as of the revelation of His nature. The fulness of this revelation, says <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-2.htm">Psalm 106:2</a> (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>), is inexhaustible. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; are the manifestations of His all-conquering power which makes everything subservient to His redemptive purposes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>); and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is the glory (praise or celebration) of His self-attestation in history. The proclaiming of these on the part of man can never be an exhaustive echo of them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-3.htm">Psalm 106:3</a> the poet tells what is the character of those who experience such manifestations of God; and to the assertion of the blessedness of these men he appends the petition in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-4.htm">Psalm 106:4</a>, that God would grant him a share in the experiences of the whole nation which is the object of these manifestations. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; beside &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; is a genitive of the object: with the pleasure which Thou turnest towards Thy people, i.e., when Thou again (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>) showest Thyself gracious unto them. On &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-15.htm">Psalm 80:15</a>, and on &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-32.htm">Jeremiah 29:32</a>; a similar Beth is that beside &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; (at, on account of, not: in connection with), <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1</a>. God's "inheritance" is His people; the name for them is varied four times, and thereby &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; is also exceptionally brought into use, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>. </body></html>
