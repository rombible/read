The more unworthy we are, the more is his kindness to be admired. And those who depend on the Redeemer's righteousness will endeavour to copy his example, and by word and deed to show forth his praise. God's people have reason to be cheerful people; and need not envy the children of men their pleasure or pride.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed are they that keep judgment - They are blessed, for their conduet is right, and it leads to happiness. The Hebrew is, "the keepers of judgment;" that is, they who observe the rules of justice in their conduct, or who are governed by the principles of integrity.<p>And he that doeth righteousness at all times - All who yield obedience to just law - whether a nation or an individual. The psalm is designed to illustrate this "by contrast;" that is, by showing, in the conduct of the Hebrew people, the consequences of "disobedience," and thus impliedly what would have been, and what always must be, the consequences of the opposite course. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-5</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. The blessing is limited to those whose principles and acts are right. How "blessed" Israel would be now, if he had "observed God's statutes" (Ps 105:45).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That keep judgment; </span> that observe and practise what is just and right towards God and men; which in the next clause he calls <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">doing righteousness. At all times; </span> in adversity as well as in prosperity. And this clause may belong either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. To the last foregoing words, <span class="ital">that doeth righteousness at all times</span>, constantly and perpetually; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. To the first words, <span class="ital">they are blessed at all times</span>, even in the day of their calamity, which therefore ought not to hinder us from this great and just duty of praising God. And so this verse coheres with the former. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/106.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Blessed are they that keep judgment,.... Or "observe" (k) it; the righteous judgment of God on wicked men; by which he is known in his justice, holiness, truth, and faithfulness; and by which the inhabitants of the earth observing it, learn to do righteousness, as follows: or else it may intend the word of God, his laws, statutes, and ordinances, after called his judgments, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>, which should be observed and kept, as the rule of our actions, walk, and conversation. <p>And he that doeth righteousness at all times; continually believes in Christ for righteousness, and puts on that as his justifying righteousness; whereby he becomes righteous as he is, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>, and performs acts of righteousness from a principle of grace, as a fruit of regeneration, and an evidence of it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm">1 John 2:29</a>, that does it with right views, aims, and ends; not to be justified and saved by it, but because God requires it; and it is for his glory, and to testify subjection to him, and thankfulness for favours received from him. And this is to be done at all times; we should never be weary of well doing, but be always abounding in good works; and happy are those that will be found so doing, such are "blessed" persons: not that their blessedness lies in or arises from righteousness done by them; but this is descriptive of such that are blessed in Christ with the remission of sins, and his justifying righteousness. And these are the proper persons to show forth the mighty acts and praise of the Lord; they are most capable of it, and more likely to perform it with acceptance than any other; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>. <p>(k) "observarent", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "observantium", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/106.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Blessed <i>are</i> they that <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> keep judgment, <i>and</i> he that doeth righteousness at all times.</span><p>(b) He shows that it is not enough to praise God with the mouth, unless the whole heart agrees to it, and all our life framed after it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/106.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. From the thought of the mercy and the might of Jehovah which are the ground of Israel’s hope, the Psalmist passes to the conditions of participation in the blessing for which he looks. Happy those who obey the Divine command, given in view of the near approach of Jehovah’s Advent to redeem, “Keep judgement, and do righteousness” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Keep you judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.">Isaiah 56:1</a>): who repent, and bring forth fruits worthy of their repentance, conforming their conduct to the demands and will of God. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-45.htm" title="That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.

The second clause merely repeats the first. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/105.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now follows the miraculous guidance through the desert to the taking possession of Canaan. The fact that the cloud (&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, root &#1506;&#1503;, to meet, to present itself to view, whence the Arabic &#8219;a&#774;na&#774;n, the visible outward side of the vault of heaven) by day, and becoming like fire by night, was their guide (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), is left out of consideration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>. With &#1500;&#1502;&#1505;&#1498; we are not to associate the idea of a covering against foes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>., but of a covering from the smiting sun, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-19.htm">Exodus 40:19</a>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>., points to the idea of a canopy. In connection with the sending of the quails the tempting character of the desire is only momentarily dwelt upon, the greater emphasis is laid on the omnipotence of the divine goodness which responded to it. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is to be read instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, the w before w having been overlooked; and the Ker&#1502; writes and points &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (like &#1505;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) in order to secure the correct pronunciation, after the analogy of the plural termination &#1497;&#1493;-. The bread of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>.) is the manna. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-41.htm">Psalm 105:41</a> the giving of water out of the rock at Rephidim and at Kadesh are brought together; the expression corresponds better to the former instance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>). &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; refers to the waters, and &#1504;&#1492;&#1512; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>, is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>, an equation instead of a comparison. In this miraculous escort the patriarchal promise moves on towards its fulfilment; the holy word of promise, and the stedfast, proved faith of Abraham - these were the two motives. The second &#1488;&#1514; is, like the first, a sign of the object, not a preposition (lxx, Targum), in connection with which <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-42.htm">Psalm 105:42</a> would be a continuation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-42.htm">Psalm 105:42</a>, dragging on without any parallelism. Joy and exulting are mentioned as the mood of the redeemed ones with reference to the festive joy displayed at the Red Sea and at Sinai. By <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a> one is reminded of the same descriptions of the antitype in Isaiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>, just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-41.htm">Psalm 105:41</a> recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>. "The lands of the heathen" are the territories of the tribes of Canaan. &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; is equivalent to &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a> : the cultivated ground, the habitable cities, and the accumulated treasures. Israel entered upon the inheritance of these peoples in every direction. As an independent people upon ground that is theirs by inheritance, keeping the revealed law of their God, was Israel to exhibit the pattern of a holy nation moulded after the divine will; and, as the beginning of the Psalm shows, to unite the peoples to themselves and their God, the God of redemption, by the proclamation of the redemption which has fallen to their own lot. </body></html>
