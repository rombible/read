An undue desire, even for lawful things, becomes sinful. God showed his displeasure for this. He filled them with uneasiness of mind, terror of conscience, and self-reproach. Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are healthful, have leanness in their souls: no love to God, no thankfulness, no appetite for the Bread of life, and then the soul must be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves, that feast their bodies and starve their souls. Even the true believer will see abundant cause to say, It is of the Lord's mercies that I am not consumed. Often have we set up idols in our hearts, cleaved to some forbidden object; so that if a greater than Moses had not stood to turn away the anger of the Lord, we should have been destroyed. If God dealt severely with Moses for unadvised words, what do those deserve who speak many proud and wicked words? It is just in God to remove those relations that are blessings to us, when we are peevish and provoking to them, and grieve their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But murmured in their tents ... - <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-27.htm">Numbers 14:27</a>. They complained of Moses; they complained of their food; they complained of the hardships of their journey; they complained of God. They did this when "in their tents;" when they had a comfortable home; when safe; when provided for; when under the direct divine protection and care. So people often complain: perhaps oftener when they have "many" comforts than when they have "few." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-27. The sin of refusing to invade Canaan, "the pleasant land" (Jer 3:19; Eze 20:6; Da 8:9), "the land of beauty," was punished by the destruction of that generation (Nu 14:28), and the threat of dispersion (De 4:25; 28:32) afterwards made to their posterity, and fulfilled in the great calamities now bewailed, may have also been then added.<p>despised&#8212;(Nu 14:31).<p>believed not his word&#8212;by which He promised He would give them the land; but rather the word of the faithless spies (compare Ps 78:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To Godâ€™s command, which was, that they should boldly and confidently enter into it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/106.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But murmured in their tents,.... Throughout their tents; the murmuring was general; they murmured often; but what is here referred to seems to be their murmuring upon the report of the spies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>. To murmur against God and his providence is a very great evil; and which generally proceeds on one or other of these two things; either because men have not so much of the good things of this world as others have; or because they endure more afflictions, and so are ready to charge the ways of God with inequality; not considering that God is a Sovereign, and may do with his own what he pleases; and that they are deserving of nothing at his hands; and that their punishment or chastisement is less than their sins deserve. <p>And hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord; to go up and possess the land; they disbelieved his word, and were disobedient to his command. The use the apostle makes of this, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7</a>, and of their other provocations, of their lust, idolatry, fornication, tempting of God, and murmuring against him, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/106.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/106.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">But murmured in their tents</span>] From <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-27.htm" title="And you murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.">Deuteronomy 1:27</a>, a graphic picture of the Israelites sulking in their tents instead of boldly preparing for the march.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/106.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But murmured in their tents.</span> The "murmuring" intended is undoubtedly that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>.

For what <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-13.htm">Psalm 106:13</a> places foremost was the root of the whole evil, that, falling away from faith in God's promise, they forgot the works of God which had been wrought in confirmation of it, and did not wait for the carrying out of His counsel. The poet has before his eye the murmuring for water on the third day after the miraculous deliverance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22-24</a>) and in Rephidim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2</a>). Then the murmuring for flesh in the first and second years of the exodus which was followed by the sending of the quails (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>), together with the wrathful judgment by which the murmuring for the second time was punished (Kibro&#770;th ha-Ta'avah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33-35</a>). This dispensation of wrath the poet calls &#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; (lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac erroneously &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, perhaps &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, nourishment), inasmuch as he interprets <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33-35</a> of a wasting disease, which swept away the people in consequence of eating inordinately of the flesh, and in the expression (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-31.htm">Psalm 78:31</a>) he closely follows <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>. The "counsel" of God for which they would not wait, is His plan with respect to the time and manner of the help. &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, root Arab. h&#803;k, a weaker power of Arab. h&#803;q, whence also Arab. h&#803;kl, p. 111, h&#803;km, p. 49 note 1, signifies prop. to make firm, e.g., a knot (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>), and starting from this (without the intervention of the metaphor moras nectere, as Schultens thinks) is transferred to a firm bent of mind, and the tension of long expectation.

The poet has <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a> in his eye. The rebellious ones were swallowed up by the earth, and their two hundred and fifty noble, non-Levite partisans consumed by fire. The fact that the poet does not mention Korah among those who were swallowed up is in perfect harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-25.htm">Numbers 16:25</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>; cf. however <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-10.htm">Numbers 26:10</a>.

The poet here glances back at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, but not without at the same time having <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8-12</a> in his mind; for the expression "in Horeb" is Deuteronomic, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2</a>, and frequently. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-20.htm">Psalm 106:20</a> is also based upon the Book of Deuteronomy: they exchanged their glory, i.e., the God who was their distinction before all peoples according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>), for the likeness (&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;) of a plough-ox (for this is pre-eminently called &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, in the dialects &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;), contrary to the prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-17.htm">Deuteronomy 4:17</a>.

God made and also expressed the resolve to destroy Israel.
