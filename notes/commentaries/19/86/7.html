The best self-preservation is to commit ourselves to God's keeping. I am one whom thou favourest, hast set apart for thyself, and made partaker of sanctifying grace. It is a great encouragement to prayer, to feel that we have received the converting grace of God, have learned to trust in him, and to be his servants. We may expect comfort from God, when we keep up our communion with God. God's goodness appears in two things, in giving and forgiving. Whatever others do, let us call upon God, and commit our case to him; we shall not seek in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee - That is, I do it now; I have done it; I will do it. The language implies a habit, or a steady purpose of mind, that in all times of trouble he would make God his refuge. It was this fixed purpose - this regular habit - which was now the ground of his confidence. A man who always makes God his refuge, who has no other ground of reliance, may feel assured that God will interpose and save him.<p>For thou wilt answer me - This also implies a fixed and steady assurance of mind, applicable not only to this case, but to all similar cases. He had firm confidence in God at all times; an unwavering belief that God is a hearer of prayer. This is a just foundation of hope when we approach God.

David had his troubles, both inward and outward, before and after he came to the throne, in private and public life; and every good man has his troubles; and there are some particular times or days of trouble; which trouble arises from different causes; sometimes from themselves, their corruptions, the weakness of their grace, and the poor performance of their duties; sometimes from others; from the persecutions of the men of the world; from the wicked lives of profane sinners, and especially professors of religion, and from the spread of false doctrine; sometimes from Satan and his temptations; and sometimes from the more immediate hand of God in afflictions, and from the hidings of his face: these troubles do not last always; they are but for a day, for a particular time; and such a season is a fit one for prayer, and the Lord invites and encourages his people to call upon him in prayer when this is the case, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>. Christ had his times of trouble, in which he called upon his divine Father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a>. <p>for thou wilt answer me; which the idols of the Gentiles could not do; Baal could not answer his priests, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>, this the psalmist concluded, both from the promise of God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>, and from his frequent experience, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/138-3.htm">Psalm 138:3</a>, a very encouraging reason or argument this to call on the Lord: Christ was always heard and answered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-41.htm">John 11:41</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/86.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/86.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

The Lord is good (&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;), i.e., altogether love, and for this very reason also ready to forgive, and great and rich in mercy for all who call upon Him as such. The beginning of the following group also accords with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/130-1.htm">Psalm 130:1-8</a> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>. </body></html>
