The best self-preservation is to commit ourselves to God's keeping. I am one whom thou favourest, hast set apart for thyself, and made partaker of sanctifying grace. It is a great encouragement to prayer, to feel that we have received the converting grace of God, have learned to trust in him, and to be his servants. We may expect comfort from God, when we keep up our communion with God. God's goodness appears in two things, in giving and forgiving. Whatever others do, let us call upon God, and commit our case to him; we shall not seek in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer ... - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-1.htm">Psalm 5:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/86.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7. unto all &#8230; that call upon thee&#8212;or, "worship Thee" (Ps 50:15; 91:15) however undeserving (Ex 34:6; Le 11:9-13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/86.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He repeats and multiplies his requests, both to ease his own troubled mind, and to prevail with God, who is well-pleased with his people’s importunity in prayer.

After God's &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, i.e., faithfulness to the promises, has descended like dew, &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, i.e., faithfulness to the covenant, springs up out of the land, the fruit of that fertilizing influence. And &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, gracious justice, looks down from heaven, smiling favour and dispensing blessing. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-13.htm">Psalm 85:13</a> places these two prospects in reciprocal relation to one another (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>); it is found once instead of twice. Jahve gives &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, everything that is only and always good and that imparts true happiness, and the land, corresponding to it, yields &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, the increase which might be expected from a land so richly blessed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-7.htm">Psalm 67:7</a> and the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4</a>). Jahve Himself is present in the land: righteousness walks before Him majestically as His herald, and righteousness &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, sets (viz., its footsteps) upon the way of His footsteps, that is to say, follows Him inseparably. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; stands once instead of twice; the construct is to a certain extent attractional, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>. Since the expression is neither &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>) nor &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>), it is natural to interpret the expression thus, and it gives moreover (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>) an excellent sense. But if, which we prefer, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; is taken in the sense of &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489; (as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>) with the following &#1500;, to give special heed to anything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-46.htm">Deuteronomy 32:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-4.htm">Ezekiel 40:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5</a>), to be anxiously concerned about it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-20.htm">1 Samuel 9:20</a>), then we avoid the supplying in thought of a second &#1508;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, which is always objectionable, and the thought obtained by the other interpretation is brought clearly before the mind: righteousness goes before Jahve, who dwells and walks abroad in Israel, and gives heed to the way of His steps, that is to say, follows carefully in His footsteps. </body></html>
