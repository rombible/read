Christ is the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth of God, in order to walk therein, than to be delivered out of earthly distress. Those who set not the Lord before them, seek after believers' souls; but the compassion, mercy, and truth of God, will be their refuge and consolation. And those whose parents were the servants of the Lord, may urge this as a plea why he should hear and help them. In considering David's experience, and that of the believer, we must not lose sight of Him, who though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me - Look upon me; as if God were now turned away, and were unmindful of his danger, his needs, and his pleading. The expression is equivalent to those in which he prays that God would incline his ear to him. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/86-1.htm">Psalm 86:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/86-6.htm">Psalm 86:6</a>, and the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-1.htm">Psalm 5:1</a>.<p>Give thy strength unto thy servant - Give such strength as proceeds from thee, and such as will accomplish what thou alone canst effect. Enable me to act as if clothed with divine power. The ground of the plea here is, that he was the "servant" of God, and he might, therefore, hope for God's interposition.<p>And save the son of thine handmaid - This is, as far as I know, the only separate allusion which David ever makes to his mother individually, unless the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a> - "I bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his mother" - be supposed to refer to his own mother. But we have elsewhere no such mention of his mother as can give us any idea of her character, and indeed it is not easy to determine who she was. The language here, however, would seem to imply that she was a pious woman, for the words "thy handmaid," as employed in the Scriptures, would most naturally suggest that idea. If so, then the ground of the plea here is that his mother was a child of God; that she had lived for his service; and that she had trained up her children for him. David now prays that, as he had been devoted to God by her, and had thus been trained up, God would remember all this, and would interfere in his behalf. Can it be wrong to urge before God, as a reason for his interposition, that we have been devoted to him by parental faithfulness and prayer; that we have been consecrated to him by baptism; that we have been trained up for his service; that in reference to us high hopes were cherished that we might carry out the purposes of pious parents, and live to accomplish what was so dear to their hearts? He who has had a pious mother has entered on life under great advantages; he has been placed under solemn responsibilites; he is permitted to hope that a mother's prayers will not be forgotten, but that her example, her teachings, and her piety will shed a hallowed influence on all the paths of life until he joins her in heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/86.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. son &#8230; handmaid&#8212;homeborn servant (compare Lu 15:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/86.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Give thy strength, </span> to assist, support, and save me.

For it seems the Lord had turned away from him, and had hid his face, and withheld the manifestation of his grace and mercy from him, and had not yielded him the help and assistance he expected; and therefore entreats that he would turn again to him, and show him his face and favour, and be merciful to him: <p>give thy strength unto thy servant; spiritual strength, strength in his soul, to exercise grace, perform duty, bear the cross, and stand up against all enemies, and hold out to the end: this is God's gift; and the psalmist pleads his relation to him as his servant, not merely by creation, but by grace; this is interpreted by the Jews of the King Messiah (u): <p>and save the son of thine handmaid; out of the hands of those that were risen up against him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-94.htm">Psalm 119:94</a>.

But although for the most part flowing on only in the language of prayer borrowed from earlier periods, this Psalm is, moreover, not without remarkable significance and beauty. With the confession of the incomparableness of the Lord is combined the prospect of the recognition of the incomparable One throughout the nations of the earth. This clear unallegorical prediction of the conversion of the heathen is the principal parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>. "All nations, which Thou hast made" - they have their being from Thee; and although they have forgotten it (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-18.htm">Psalm 9:18</a>), they will nevertheless at last come to recognise it. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, since the article is wanting, are nations of all tribes (countries and nationalities); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>; Tobit 13:11, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;, with ibid. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-6.htm">Psalm 14:6</a>, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;.

Luther has rightly departed from the renderings of the lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate: laetetur (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468; from &#1495;&#1491;&#1492;). The meaning, however, is not so much "keep my heart near to the only thing," as "direct all its powers and concentrate them on the one thing." The following group shows us what is the meaning of the deliverance out of the hell beneath (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, like &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, the earth beneath, the inner parts of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-14.htm">Ezekiel 31:14</a>.), for which the poet promises beforehand to manifest his thankfulness (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/86-13.htm">Psalm 86:13</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-14.htm">Psalm 56:14</a>). </body></html>
