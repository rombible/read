The best self-preservation is to commit ourselves to God's keeping. I am one whom thou favourest, hast set apart for thyself, and made partaker of sanctifying grace. It is a great encouragement to prayer, to feel that we have received the converting grace of God, have learned to trust in him, and to be his servants. We may expect comfort from God, when we keep up our communion with God. God's goodness appears in two things, in giving and forgiving. Whatever others do, let us call upon God, and commit our case to him; we shall not seek in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rejoice the soul of thy servant - Cause me to rejoice; to wit, by thy gracious interposition, and by delivering me from danger and death.<p>For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>. The idea is that of arousing himself, or exerting himself, as one does who makes strenuous efforts to obtain an object. He was not languid, or indifferent; he did not put forth merely weak and fitful efforts to find God, but he bent his whole powers to that end; he arouses himself thoroughly to seek the divine help. Languid and feeble efforts in seeking after God will be attended with no success. In so great a matter - when so much depends on the divine favor - when such great interests are at stake - the whole soul should be roused to one great and strenuous effort; not that we can obtain his favor by force or power, and not that any strength of ours will prevail of itself, but<p>(a) because nothing less will indicate the proper intensity of desire; and<p>(b) because such is his appointment in regard to the manner in which we are to seek his favor.<p>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/86.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. lift up my soul&#8212;with strong desire (Ps 25:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/86.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The expression notes fervent desire joined with hope or expectation, as appears by comparing <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-15.htm" title="At his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it: lest he cry against you to the LORD, and it be sin to you.">Deu 24:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-27.htm" title="But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.">Jeremiah 22:27</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/86.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Rejoice the soul of thy servant,....

The faithful are promised that they shall come ultimately to a condition of exceeding great joy; but even saints are sometimes impatient, and want their joy in this world and at once. <span class="cmt_word">For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-1.htm">Psalm 25:1</a>, entitled, like this, "a Psalm of David"). There is no more likely way of attaining to spiritual joy than to be always lifting up the soul to God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/85.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet pursues this charming picture of the future further. After God's &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, i.e., faithfulness to the promises, has descended like dew, &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, i.e., faithfulness to the covenant, springs up out of the land, the fruit of that fertilizing influence. And &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, gracious justice, looks down from heaven, smiling favour and dispensing blessing. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-13.htm">Psalm 85:13</a> places these two prospects in reciprocal relation to one another (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>); it is found once instead of twice. Jahve gives &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, everything that is only and always good and that imparts true happiness, and the land, corresponding to it, yields &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, the increase which might be expected from a land so richly blessed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-7.htm">Psalm 67:7</a> and the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4</a>). Jahve Himself is present in the land: righteousness walks before Him majestically as His herald, and righteousness &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, sets (viz., its footsteps) upon the way of His footsteps, that is to say, follows Him inseparably. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; stands once instead of twice; the construct is to a certain extent attractional, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>. Since the expression is neither &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>) nor &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>), it is natural to interpret the expression thus, and it gives moreover (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>) an excellent sense. But if, which we prefer, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; is taken in the sense of &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489; (as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>) with the following &#1500;, to give special heed to anything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-46.htm">Deuteronomy 32:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-4.htm">Ezekiel 40:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5</a>), to be anxiously concerned about it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-20.htm">1 Samuel 9:20</a>), then we avoid the supplying in thought of a second &#1508;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, which is always objectionable, and the thought obtained by the other interpretation is brought clearly before the mind: righteousness goes before Jahve, who dwells and walks abroad in Israel, and gives heed to the way of His steps, that is to say, follows carefully in His footsteps. </body></html>
