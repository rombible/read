The best self-preservation is to commit ourselves to God's keeping. I am one whom thou favourest, hast set apart for thyself, and made partaker of sanctifying grace. It is a great encouragement to prayer, to feel that we have received the converting grace of God, have learned to trust in him, and to be his servants. We may expect comfort from God, when we keep up our communion with God. God's goodness appears in two things, in giving and forgiving. Whatever others do, let us call upon God, and commit our case to him; we shall not seek in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be merciful unto me, O Lord - It was mercy after all that he relied on, and not justice. It was not because he had any claim on the ground that he was "holy," but all that he had and hoped for was to be traced to the mercy of God.<p>For I cry unto thee daily - Margin, as in Hebrew, "All the day." The meaning is, that he did this constantly, or without intermission. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/86.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 86<p>Ps 86:1-17.

The poet stirs himself up to give ear to the words of God, like Habakkuk, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>. Beside &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492; we find the reading &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>. The construction of &#1492;&#1488;&#1500; &#1492; is appositional, like &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;, Ges. 113. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; neither introduces the divine answer in express words, nor states the ground on which he hearkens, but rather supports the fact that God speaks from that which He has to speak. Peace is the substance of that which He speaks to His people, and that (the particularizing Waw) to His saints; but with the addition of an admonition. &#1488;&#1500; is dehortative. It is not to be assumed in connection with this ethical notion that the ah of &#1500;&#1499;&#1505;&#1500;&#1492; is the locative ah as in &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-18.htm">Psalm 9:18</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;&#1492; is related to &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; like foolery to folly. The present misfortune, as is indicated here, is the merited consequence of foolish behaviour (playing the fool). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>. the poet unfolds the promise of peace which he has heard, just as he has heard it. What is meant by &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493; is particularized first by the infinitive, and then in perfects of actual fact. The possessions that make a people truly happy and prosperous are mentioned under a charming allegory exactly after Isaiah's manner, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-16.htm">Isaiah 32:16</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>. The glory that has been far removed again takes up its abode in the land. Mercy or loving-kindness walks along the streets of Jerusalem, and there meets fidelity, like one guardian angel meeting the other. Righteousness and peace or prosperity, these two inseparable brothers, kiss each other there, and fall lovingly into each other's arms.<p>(Note: Concerning St. Bernard's beautiful parable of the reconciliation of the inviolability of divine threatening and of justice with mercy and peace in the work of redemption, which has grown out of this passage of the Psalms, Misericordia et veritas obviaverunt sibi, justitia et pax osculatae sunt, and has been transferred to the painting, poetry, and drama of the middle ages, vid., Piper's Evangelischer Kalender, 1859, S. 24-34, and the beautiful miniature representing the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; and &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; of a Greek Psalter, 1867, S. 63.) </body></html>
