Observe, reader, it is the continual subject of the Mediator’s intercession above, and should be the subject of our prayers below, “that we may be taught the way of Jehovah, the way to life eternal, prepared for us, through faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus,” and that we may walk therein “without error in doctrine, or deviation in practice, believing all things which God hath revealed, and doing whatsoever he hath commanded us; that the affections of our hearts may be withdrawn from other objects, and, being no longer divided between God and the world, may become united in the filial fear of his name: as the grand principle of action.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/86.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>86:8-17 Our God alone possesses almighty power and infinite love. Christ is the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth of God, in order to walk therein, than to be delivered out of earthly distress. Those who set not the Lord before them, seek after believers' souls; but the compassion, mercy, and truth of God, will be their refuge and consolation. And those whose parents were the servants of the Lord, may urge this as a plea why he should hear and help them. In considering David's experience, and that of the believer, we must not lose sight of Him, who though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Teach me thy way, O Lord - That is, in the present emergency.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>, it is rendered united: "Unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-20.htm">Isaiah 14:20</a>, it is translated joined: "Thou shalt not be joined with them." The adverb - &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;  yachad, occurs often, and is rendered together, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-6.htm">Genesis 13:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-6.htm">Genesis 22:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-19.htm">Genesis 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-7.htm">Genesis 36:7</a>; et saepe. The idea is that of union, or conjunction; of being together; of constituting one; and this is accomplished in the heart when there is one great ruling object before the mind which nothing is allowed to interfere with. It may be added, that there is no more appropriate prayer which a man can offer than that his heart may have such a unity of purpose, and that nothing may be allowed to interfere with that one supreme purpose. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/86.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

The methods of thy grace, which thou hast taken, and dost take, in the salvation of men, in the contrivance, impetration, and application of it; or the way which thou hast marked out for thy people to walk in, the way of thy commandments: each of these the psalmist had knowledge of before; but he desires to be more and more instructed therein, as every good man does; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a>. <p>I will walk in thy truth; in Christ, the truth of types, and by whom grace and truth came, and who is truth itself, and the true way to eternal life; and to walk in him is to walk by faith in him, in hope of eternal happiness through him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a> or in the truth of the Gospel, of Gospel doctrine, Gospel worship, and Gospel conversation; to walk in it is to walk becoming it, and abide by it, its truths and ordinances; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm">2 John 1:4</a>. <p>unite my heart to fear thy name; there must be an heart given to man to fear the Lord; for the fear of the Lord is not naturally in their hearts, or before their eyes; and they should have, not a divided and distracted heart, an heart divided between God and the world, between the fear of God and the fear of man; but a heart united to the Lord, that cleaves to him, and him only; a single and a sincere heart; a heart that has a single view to his glory, and a sincere affection for him; and such a heart the Lord has promised to give to his people, in order to fear him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-39.htm">Jeremiah 32:39</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/86.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{h}</span> Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.</span><p>(h) He confesses himself ignorant till God has taught him, and his heart variable and separate from God, till God join it to him, and confirm it in his obedience.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/86.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Teach me thy way, O Lord</span>] Word for word from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-11.htm" title="Teach me your way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of my enemies.">Psalm 27:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will walk in thy truth</span>] When Thou dost teach me Thy way.

The unity and uniqueness of God demand unity of heart in His worshippers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/6-4.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:...">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-12.htm" title="And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>). Such singleheartedness is frequently expressed by the phrases ‘a whole heart,’ ‘a perfect heart,’ but the verb <span class="ital">unite</span> is found here only in this sense. Doubtless it is an allusion to the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-39.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:">Jeremiah 32:39</a>, “I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever.” Cp. too <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-58.htm" title="If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;">Deuteronomy 28:58</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX and Syr. read the consonants with different vowels (<span class="ital">yichad</span> for <span class="ital">yachçd</span>), <span class="ital">let my heart rejoice to fear thy name</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/86.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-17.</span> - The third strophe is almost equally divided between prayer and praise, vers. 11, 16, and 17 being devoted to the one; and vers. 12, 13, and 15 to the other.

Man cannot know "the way of the Lord," unless he is taught of God. The inward anointing of the Spirit is needful to teach us what God would really have us do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27</a>). It is only when we are thus taught that we can "walk in his truth." <span class="cmt_word">Unite my heart to fear thy Name.</span> So Symmachus, who has <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; Canon Cook, Dr. Kay, Hupfeld, Professor Alexander, and the Revised Version.

But the textual reading has the weight of authority in its favour, and gives an excellent sense, "Bring all my heart into unison, that it may be wholly fixed on thee."
