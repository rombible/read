Their hearts, as well as their times, are all in his hand; he formed the spirit of each man within him. All the powers of the creature depend upon him, and are of no account, of no avail at all, without him. If we make God's favour sure towards us, then we need not fear whatever is against us. We are to give to him the glory of his special grace. All human devices for the salvation of our souls are vain; but the Lord's watchful eye is over those whose conscientious fear of his name proceeds from a believing hope in his mercy. In difficulties they shall be helped; in dangers they shall not receive any real damage. Those that fear God and his wrath, must hope in God and his mercy; for there is no flying from him, but by flying to him. Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us; let us always have the comfort and benefit, not according to our merits, but according to the promise which thou hast in thy word given to us, and according to the faith thou hast by thy Spirit and grace wrought in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Our soul waiteth for the Lord - This and the subsequent verses to the end of the psalm refer to the people of God, expressing their faith in him in view of the considerations suggested in the former part of the psalm. The language is expressive of the general character of piety. True piety leads people to wait on the Lord; to depend on Him; to look to His interposition in danger, sickness, poverty, want; to rely upon Him for all that is hoped for in this life, and for salvation in the life to come. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-1.htm">Psalm 62:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>.<p>He is our help - Our aid; our helper.

Here the godly avow their reliance upon him whom the Psalm extols. To wait is a great lesson. To be quiet in expectation, patient in hope, single in confidence, is one of the bright attainments of a Christian. Our soul, our life, must hang upon God; we are not to trust him with a few gewgaws, but with all we have and are. "He is our help and our shield." Our help in labour, our shield in danger. The Lord answereth all things to his people. He is their all in all. Note the three "ours" in the text. These holdfast words are precious. Personal possession makes the Christian man; all else is mere talk.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-21.htm">Psalm 33:21</a><p>"For our hearts shall rejoice in him." The duty commended and commanded in the first verse is here presented to the Lord. We, who trust, cannot but be of a glad heart, our inmost nature must triumph in our faithful God. "Because we have trusted in his holy name." The root of faith in due time bears the flower of rejoicing. Doubts breed sorrow, confidence creates joy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The help of us Israelites, to whom he hath made many promises and glorious discoveries of his goodness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Our soul waiteth for the Lord,.... This, and what follows, are the words of the church, expressing her expectation, faith, and joy, by reason of what is suggested in the preceding verses.

This portion of the song is like a paraphrase of the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>. The theme in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a> is proved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13</a> by the fact, that Jahve is the omniscient Ruler, because He is the Creator of men, without whose knowledge nothing is undertaken either secretly or openly, and especially if against His people.  Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a> it is supported by the fact, that His people have in Jahve a stronger defence than the greatest worldly power would be. Jahve is called the fashioner of all the hearts of men, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, as being their Maker. As such He is also the observer of all the works of men; for His is acquainted with their origin in the laboratory of the heart, which He as Creator has formed. Hupfeld takes &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; as an equalisation (pariter ac) of the two appositions; but then it ought to be &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>). The lxx correctly renders it &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, singillatim. It is also needless to translate it, as Hupfeld does: He who formed, qui finxit; for the hearts of men were not from the very first created all at one time, but the primeval impartation of spirit-life is continued at every birth in some mysterious way. God is the Father of spirits, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-9.htm">Hebrews 12:9</a>. For this very reason everything that exists, even to the most hidden thing, is encompassed by His omniscience and omnipotence. He exercises an omniscient control over all things, and makes all things subservient to the designs of His plan of the universe, which, so far as His people are concerned, is the plan of salvation. Without Him nothing comes to pass; but through Him everything takes place. The victory of the king, and the safety of the warrior, are not their own works. Their great military power and bodily strength can accomplish nothing without God, who can also be mighty in the feeble.  Even for purposes of victory (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, cf. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>) the war-horse is &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, i.e., a thing that promises much, but can in reality do nothing; it is not its great strength, by which it enables the trooper to escape (&#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;). "The horse," says Solomon in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>, "is equipped for the day of battle, but &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;, Jahve's is the victory," He giveth it to whomsoever He will. The ultimate ends of all things that come to pass are in His hands, and - as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>. say, directing special attention to this important truth by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; - the eye of this God, that is to say the final aim of His government of the world, is directed towards them that fear Him, is pointed at them that hope in His mercy (&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-19.htm">Psalm 33:19</a>, the object, &#1500;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, is expanded by way of example. From His mercy or loving-kindness, not from any acts of their own, conscious of their limited condition and feebleness, they look for protection in the midst of the greatest peril, and for the preservation of their life in famine. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a> is very similar; but the one passage sounds as independent as the other. </body></html>
