Their hearts, as well as their times, are all in his hand; he formed the spirit of each man within him. All the powers of the creature depend upon him, and are of no account, of no avail at all, without him. If we make God's favour sure towards us, then we need not fear whatever is against us. We are to give to him the glory of his special grace. All human devices for the salvation of our souls are vain; but the Lord's watchful eye is over those whose conscientious fear of his name proceeds from a believing hope in his mercy. In difficulties they shall be helped; in dangers they shall not receive any real damage. Those that fear God and his wrath, must hope in God and his mercy; for there is no flying from him, but by flying to him. Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us; let us always have the comfort and benefit, not according to our merits, but according to the promise which thou hast in thy word given to us, and according to the faith thou hast by thy Spirit and grace wrought in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed is the nation - For the meaning of the word "blessed," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. The idea here is, that the nation referred to is happy, or that its condition is desirable. What is true of a nation is also as true of an individual.<p>Whose God is the Lord - Whose God is Yahweh - for so this is in the original Hebrew. That is, the nation which worships Yahweh, and is under his protection. This is evidently said to distinguish such a nation from those which worshipped false gods or idols. Such a nation is blessed or happy, because:<p>(a) He is a real God, the true God, and not an imagination or fiction;<p>(b) because His laws are just and good, and their observance will always tend to promote the public welfare and prosperity;<p>(c) because His protection will be vouchsafed to such a nation; and<p>(d) because His worship, and the influence of His religion, will tend to diffuse virtue, intelligence, purity, and truth, over a land, and thus will promote its welfare.<p>And the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance - Chosen to be "His;" or, His portion. The primary reference here is undoubtedly to the Hebrew people, called his "inheritance:" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-62.htm">Psalm 78:62</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>; or "heritage," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-5.htm">Psalm 94:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-9.htm">Jeremiah 12:9</a>; but what is here affirmed of that people is true also of all other people who worship the true God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-19. The inference from the foregoing in Ps 33:12 is illustrated by God's special providence, underlying which is His minute knowledge of all men.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/33.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.<p>"Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord." Israel was happy in the worship of the only true God. It was the blessedness of the chosen nation to have received a revelation from Jehovah. While others grovelled before their idols, the chosen people were elevated by a spiritual religion which introduced them to the invisible God, and led them to trust in him. All who confide in the Lord are blessed in the largest and deepest sense, and none can reverse the blessing. "And the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance." Election is at the bottom of it all. The divine choice rules the day; none take Jehovah to be their God till he takes them to be his people. What an ennobling choice this is! We are selected to no mean estate, and for no ignoble purpose: we are made the peculiar domain and delight of the Lord our God. Being so blessed, let us rejoice in our portion, and show the world by our lives that we serve a glorious Master. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Seeing the Lord is so great and glorious in wisdom, and power, and goodness, as hath been hitherto said, as they must needs be very miserable who are strangers or enemies to him; so thrice happy is that people of Israel, who, though they be despised by the Gentiles, are chosen by this Almighty God, to be his peculiar portion, and friends, and servants. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,.... Who have an interest in such a wonder working God, both in creation and in providence, and especially in grace: which, though it may have a principal regard to the nation of Israel, whose God he was in a very distinguishing manner, yet must not be limited to them; for he is the God of the Gentiles also: this nation is the chosen generation, the holy nation and peculiar people, both among Jews and Gentiles; and the Lord is the God of these; not only as the God of nature and providence, but as the God of all grace; who must be happy, since he is their portion and exceeding great reward; nor shall they want any good thing, nor need they fear any evil; they are on the heart of God, and cannot be separated from his love; they are engraven on the palms of his hands, and shall be helped, strengthened, and upheld with the right hand of his righteousness; all things work together for their good; and this God of theirs will be their God and guide unto death; they may expect every needful good thing now, and all glory and happiness hereafter; <p>and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance; not Israel only, but the Gentiles also; not all mankind, but a peculiar people, whom the Lord has chosen out of the world to be his possession, and who are his jewels and peculiar treasure; these are happy, being the Lord's portion, and the lot of his inheritance; and he chooses an inheritance for them, adopts and begets them unto it, and makes them meet to be partakers of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Blessed <i>is</i> the nation whose <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> God <i>is</i> the LORD; <i>and</i> the people <i>whom</i> he hath chosen for his own inheritance.</span><p>(h) He shows that all our happiness stands in this, that the Lord is our God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">Blessed</span>] Or, happy; see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm" title="Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.">Psalm 1:1</a>.

And the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance</span>. The intrusion of the word "and" is unfortunate. One "nation" or "people" only is spoken of, viz. the Hebrews. They are "blessed" in two respects: first, because they know God as Jehovah; and secondly, because he has chosen them out of all the nations of the earth to be his "peculiar people" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-53.htm">1 Kings 8:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-4.htm">Psalm 135:4</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>God's praiseworthiness (b) as the Creator of the world in the kingdom of Nature.

The heavens above and the waters beneath stand side by side as miracles of creation. The display of His power in the waters of the sea consists in His having confined them within fixed bounds and keeping them within these. &#1504;&#1491; is a pile, i.e., a piled up heap (Arabic nadd), and more especially an inference to harvest: like such a heap do the convex waters of the sea, being firmly held together, rise above the level of the continents. The expression is like that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>; although there the reference is to a miracle occurring in the course of history, and in this passage to a miracle of creation. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1505; refers to the heap itself, not to the walls of the storehouses as holding together. This latter figure is not introduced until <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-7.htm">Psalm 33:7</a>: the bed of the sea and those of the rivers are, as it were, &#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, treasuries or storehouses, in which God has deposited the deep, foaming waves or surging mass of waters.
