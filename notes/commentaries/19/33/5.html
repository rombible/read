Thankful praise is the breath and language of holy joy. Religious songs are proper expressions of thankful praise. Every endowment we possess, should be employed with all our skill and earnestness in God's service. His promises are all wise and good. His word is right, and therefore we are only in the right when we agree with it. His works are all done in truth. He is the righteous Lord, therefore loveth righteousness. What a pity it is that this earth, which is so full of the proofs and instances of God's goodness, should be so empty of his praises; and that of the multitudes who live upon his bounty, there are so few who live to his glory! What the Lord does, he does to purpose; it stands fast. He overrules all the counsels of men, and makes them serve his counsels; even that is fulfilled, which to us is most surprising, the eternal counsel of God, nor can any thing prevent its coming to pass.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He loveth righteousness - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>.<p>And judgment - justice.<p>The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord - Margin, "mercy."

In this case the person addressed must be the poet, who, however, has already attained the knowledge here treated of. It is he himself who now directly adopts the tone of the teacher (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12</a>). That which David, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>, promises to do, he here takes in hand, viz., the instruction of sinners in the way of salvation. It is unnecessary to read &#1488;&#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1498; instead of &#1488;&#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1492;, as Olshausen does; the suffix of &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; and &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498; (for &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;) avails also for this third verb, to which &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, equivalent to &#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (fixing my eye upon thee, i.e., with sympathising love taking an interest in thee), stands in the relation of a subordinate relative clause. The lxx renders it by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, so that it takes &#1497;&#1506;&#1509;, in accordance with its radical signification firmare, as the regens of &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (I will fix my eye steadfastly upon thee); but for this there is no support in the general usage of the language. The accents give a still different rendering; they apparently make &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; an accus. adverb. (Since &#1488;&#1506;&#1510;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; is transformed from &#1488;&#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;: I will counsel thee with mine eye; but in every other instance, &#1497;&#1506;&#1509; &#1506;&#1500; means only a hostile determination against any one, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-5.htm">Isaiah 7:5</a>. The form of address, without changing its object, passes over, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a>, into the plural and the expression becomes harsh in perfect keeping with the perverted character which it describes. The sense is on the whole clear: not constrained, but willing obedience is becoming to man, in distinction from an irrational animal which must be led by a bridle drawn through its mouth. The asyndeton clause: like a horse, a mule (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; as an animal that is isolated and does not pair; cf. Arab. fard, alone of its kind, single, unlike, the opposite of which is Arab. zawj, a pair, equal number), has nothing remarkable about it, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>. But it is not clear what &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; is intended to mean. We might take it in its usual signification "ornament," and render "with bit and bridle, its ornament," and perhaps at once recognise therein an allusion to the senseless servility of the animal, viz., that its ornament is also the means by which it is kept in check, unless &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, ornament, is perhaps directly equivalent to "harness." Still the rendering of the lxx is to be respected: in camo et fraeno - as Jerome reproduces it - maxilas eorum constringere qui non approximant ad te. If &#1506;&#1491;&#1497; means jaw, mouth or check, then &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is equivalent to ora eorum obturanda sunt (Ges. 132, rem. 1), which the lxx expressed by &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, constringe, or following the Cod. Alex., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), constringes. Like Ewald and Hitzig (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>), we may compare with &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, the cheek, the Arabic chadd, which, being connected with &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, a furrow, signifies properly the furrow of the face, i.e., the indented part running downwards from the inner corners of the eyes to both sides of the nose, but then by synecdoche the cheek. If `dyw refers to the mouth or jaws, then it looks as if &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; must be translated: in order that they may not come too near thee, viz., to hurt thee (Targ., Syriac, Rashi, etc.); but this rendering does not produce any point of comparison corresponding to the context of this Psalm. Therefore, it is rather to be rendered: otherwise there is no coming near to thee. This interpretation takes the emphasis of the &#1489;&#1500; into account, and assumes that, according to a usage of the language that is without further support, one might, for instance, say: &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; &#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, "I will never go thither." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-17.htm">Proverbs 23:17</a>, &#1489;&#1500; also includes within itself the verb to be. So here: by no means an approaching to thee, i.e., there is, if thou dost not bridle them, no approaching or coming near to thee. These words are not addressed to God, but to man, who is obliged to use harsh and forcible means in taming animals, and can only thus keep them under his control and near to him. In the antitype, it is the sinner, who will not come to God, although God only is his help, and who, as David has learned by experience, must first of all endure inward torture, before he comes to a right state of mind. This agonising life of the guilty conscience which the ungodly man leads, is contrasted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a> with the mercy which encompasses on all sides him, who trusts in God. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, in accordance with the treatment of this adjective as if it were a numeral (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a>), is an attributive or adjective placed before its noun. The final clause might be rendered: mercy encompasses him; but the Poel and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a> favour the rendering: with mercy doth He encompass him. </body></html>
