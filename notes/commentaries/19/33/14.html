Their hearts, as well as their times, are all in his hand; he formed the spirit of each man within him. All the powers of the creature depend upon him, and are of no account, of no avail at all, without him. If we make God's favour sure towards us, then we need not fear whatever is against us. We are to give to him the glory of his special grace. All human devices for the salvation of our souls are vain; but the Lord's watchful eye is over those whose conscientious fear of his name proceeds from a believing hope in his mercy. In difficulties they shall be helped; in dangers they shall not receive any real damage. Those that fear God and his wrath, must hope in God and his mercy; for there is no flying from him, but by flying to him. Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us; let us always have the comfort and benefit, not according to our merits, but according to the promise which thou hast in thy word given to us, and according to the faith thou hast by thy Spirit and grace wrought in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the place of his habitation - From his dwelling - heaven.<p>He looketh down - He continually sees. The sentiment is repeated here to show that no one can escape his eye; that the condition, the characters, the wants of all are intimately known to him, and that thus he can watch over his people - all that love and serve him - and can guard them from danger.

Jahve's &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is His almighty "Let there be;" and &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (inasmuch as the breath is here regarded as the material of which the word is formed and the bearer of the word) is the command, or in general, the operation of His commanding omnipotence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>). The heavens above and the waters beneath stand side by side as miracles of creation. The display of His power in the waters of the sea consists in His having confined them within fixed bounds and keeping them within these. &#1504;&#1491; is a pile, i.e., a piled up heap (Arabic nadd), and more especially an inference to harvest: like such a heap do the convex waters of the sea, being firmly held together, rise above the level of the continents. The expression is like that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>; although there the reference is to a miracle occurring in the course of history, and in this passage to a miracle of creation. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1505; refers to the heap itself, not to the walls of the storehouses as holding together. This latter figure is not introduced until <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-7.htm">Psalm 33:7</a>: the bed of the sea and those of the rivers are, as it were, &#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, treasuries or storehouses, in which God has deposited the deep, foaming waves or surging mass of waters. The inhabitants (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;, not &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;) of the earth have cause to fear God who is thus omnipotent (&#1502;&#1503;, in the sense of falling back from in terror); for He need only speak the word and that which He wills comes into being out of nothing, as we see from the hexameron or history of Creation, but which is also confirmed in human history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37</a>). He need only command and it stands forth like an obedient servant, that appears in all haste at the call of his lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a>. </body></html>
