Thankful praise is the breath and language of holy joy. Religious songs are proper expressions of thankful praise. Every endowment we possess, should be employed with all our skill and earnestness in God's service. His promises are all wise and good. His word is right, and therefore we are only in the right when we agree with it. His works are all done in truth. He is the righteous Lord, therefore loveth righteousness. What a pity it is that this earth, which is so full of the proofs and instances of God's goodness, should be so empty of his praises; and that of the multitudes who live upon his bounty, there are so few who live to his glory! What the Lord does, he does to purpose; it stands fast. He overrules all the counsels of men, and makes them serve his counsels; even that is fulfilled, which to us is most surprising, the eternal counsel of God, nor can any thing prevent its coming to pass.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he spake, and it was done - The word "done," introduced here by our translators, enfeebles the sentence. It would be made more expressive and sublime as it is in the original: "He spake, and it was." That is, Its existence depended on his word; the universe sprang into being at his command; he had only to speak, and it arose in all its grandeur where before there was nothing. There is here an undoubted allusion to the account in Genesis of the work of creation - where the statement is that all depended on the command or the word of God: <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>. Nothing more sublime can be conceived than the language thus employed in the Scriptures in describing that work. No more elevated conception can enter the human mind than that which is implied when it is said, God "spoke" and all this vast and wonderful universe rose into being.<p>He commanded - He gave order; he required the universe to appear.<p>And it stood fast - Or rather, "stood." That is, it stood forth; it appeared; it rose into being. The idea of its "standing fast" is not in the original, and greatly enfeebles the expression. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. he spake&#8212;literally, "said."<p>it was&#8212;The addition of "done" weakens the sense (compare Ge 1:3-10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It was done; </span> the work here mentioned, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>,7</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Stood fast; </span> or, <span class="ital">stood forth</span>, as a servant at his masterâ€™s command; or, <span class="ital">was</span> or <span class="ital">did exist</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he spake, and it was done,....
