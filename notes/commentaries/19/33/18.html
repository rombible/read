Their hearts, as well as their times, are all in his hand; he formed the spirit of each man within him. All the powers of the creature depend upon him, and are of no account, of no avail at all, without him. If we make God's favour sure towards us, then we need not fear whatever is against us. We are to give to him the glory of his special grace. All human devices for the salvation of our souls are vain; but the Lord's watchful eye is over those whose conscientious fear of his name proceeds from a believing hope in his mercy. In difficulties they shall be helped; in dangers they shall not receive any real damage. Those that fear God and his wrath, must hope in God and his mercy; for there is no flying from him, but by flying to him. Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us; let us always have the comfort and benefit, not according to our merits, but according to the promise which thou hast in thy word given to us, and according to the faith thou hast by thy Spirit and grace wrought in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him - He watches over them, and "he" guards them from danger. His eye is, in fact, upon all men; but it is directed with special attention to those who fear him and trust in him. Their security is in the fact that the eye of God is upon them; that he knows their wants; that he sees their dangers; that he has ample ability to deliver and save them.<p>Upon them that hope in his mercy - Upon the pious; upon his friends. The expression is a very beautiful one. It describes the true state of a pious heart; it in fact characterizes the whole of religion, for we imply all that there is in religion on earth when we say of a man, that - conscious of his weakness and sinfulness - "he hopes in the mercy of God." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18, 19.

Not with dread of his wrath, or distrust of his grace, or for sinister ends and selfish views, but with a godly fear; by which men hate evil, depart from it, are careful not to offend God by it, but to serve and worship him; on such is not only his eye of Providence to protect from danger, to supply with the necessaries of life, but of love and grace; he looks upon them with delight and pleasure; his eye is upon them to watch over them for good, to guard them from every enemy, and from all evil, and to communicate to them every needful measure of grace; <p>upon them that hope in his mercy; not his absolute mercy, but his special mercy in Christ; which appears in the provision of him as a Saviour, in the mission of him into this world, and redemption by him; and is displayed in regeneration, the pardon of sin, and eternal life: and such that hope in it are they that see themselves miserable creatures, and in need of it; and who are encouraged to hope in it from the plenty and abundance of it in the heart of God; and from the many instances of it among men, and even some the chief of sinners; and they do hope in it for the forgiveness of their sins, and for salvation and eternal glory; and on these the eye of the Lord is, as before, <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> the eye of the LORD <i>is</i> upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;</span><p>(m) God shows his mercy toward his, which man by no means is able to compass.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">the eye of the Lord</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-8.htm" title="I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go: I will guide you with my eye.">Psalm 32:8</a>, note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm" title="The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry.">Psalm 34:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-5.htm" title="But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.">Ezra 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-7.htm" title="He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yes, he does establish them for ever, and they are exalted.">Job 36:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-12.htm" title="For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.">1 Peter 3:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that hope in his mercy</span>] Or, <span class="ital">that wait for his lovingkindness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-24.htm" title="Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all you that hope in the LORD.">Psalm 31:24</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the eye of the Lord</span> is <span class="cmt_word">upon them that fear him; upon them that hope in his mercy</span>.

This portion of the song is like a paraphrase of the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>. The theme in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a> is proved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13</a> by the fact, that Jahve is the omniscient Ruler, because He is the Creator of men, without whose knowledge nothing is undertaken either secretly or openly, and especially if against His people.  Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a> it is supported by the fact, that His people have in Jahve a stronger defence than the greatest worldly power would be. Jahve is called the fashioner of all the hearts of men, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, as being their Maker. As such He is also the observer of all the works of men; for His is acquainted with their origin in the laboratory of the heart, which He as Creator has formed. Hupfeld takes &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; as an equalisation (pariter ac) of the two appositions; but then it ought to be &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>). The lxx correctly renders it &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, singillatim. It is also needless to translate it, as Hupfeld does: He who formed, qui finxit; for the hearts of men were not from the very first created all at one time, but the primeval impartation of spirit-life is continued at every birth in some mysterious way. God is the Father of spirits, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-9.htm">Hebrews 12:9</a>. For this very reason everything that exists, even to the most hidden thing, is encompassed by His omniscience and omnipotence. He exercises an omniscient control over all things, and makes all things subservient to the designs of His plan of the universe, which, so far as His people are concerned, is the plan of salvation. Without Him nothing comes to pass; but through Him everything takes place. The victory of the king, and the safety of the warrior, are not their own works. Their great military power and bodily strength can accomplish nothing without God, who can also be mighty in the feeble.  Even for purposes of victory (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, cf. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>) the war-horse is &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, i.e., a thing that promises much, but can in reality do nothing; it is not its great strength, by which it enables the trooper to escape (&#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;). "The horse," says Solomon in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>, "is equipped for the day of battle, but &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;, Jahve's is the victory," He giveth it to whomsoever He will. The ultimate ends of all things that come to pass are in His hands, and - as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>. say, directing special attention to this important truth by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; - the eye of this God, that is to say the final aim of His government of the world, is directed towards them that fear Him, is pointed at them that hope in His mercy (&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-19.htm">Psalm 33:19</a>, the object, &#1500;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, is expanded by way of example. From His mercy or loving-kindness, not from any acts of their own, conscious of their limited condition and feebleness, they look for protection in the midst of the greatest peril, and for the preservation of their life in famine. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a> is very similar; but the one passage sounds as independent as the other. </body></html>
