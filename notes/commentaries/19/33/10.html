Thankful praise is the breath and language of holy joy. Religious songs are proper expressions of thankful praise. Every endowment we possess, should be employed with all our skill and earnestness in God's service. His promises are all wise and good. His word is right, and therefore we are only in the right when we agree with it. His works are all done in truth. He is the righteous Lord, therefore loveth righteousness. What a pity it is that this earth, which is so full of the proofs and instances of God's goodness, should be so empty of his praises; and that of the multitudes who live upon his bounty, there are so few who live to his glory! What the Lord does, he does to purpose; it stands fast. He overrules all the counsels of men, and makes them serve his counsels; even that is fulfilled, which to us is most surprising, the eternal counsel of God, nor can any thing prevent its coming to pass.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought - Margin: "maketh frustrate." The Hebrew word means to "break," or to "annul." The word here rendered "heathen" means "nations;" and the idea is that God, by his own overruling purpose and providence, frustrates the designs of the nations of the earth; that he carries forward his own designs and purposes in spite of theirs; that their plans avail nothing when they come in competition with his. their purposes must yield to His purpose. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9-10</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>, note. All the plans and purposes of the nations of the earth that conflict with the purposes of God will be vain; all those plans, whatever they may be, will be made subservient under His providence to the promotion of His great designs.<p>He maketh the devices of the people of none effect - That is, He renders them vain, unsuccessful, ineffectual. The word "people" here is synonymous with "nations," and the idea is, that whatever may be the thoughts and purposes of human beings, if they are opposed to the plans of God, or if they do not tend to promote His glory, they will be rendered futile or vain. God is a great and glorious Sovereign over all, and He will make everything subordinate to the promotion of His own great designs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11.

The psalmist having taken notice of the works of creation, in order to excite the saints to praise, proceeds to observe the providence of God, and particularly that branch of it which lies in disappointing the designs of wicked men; it is wickedness which they consult and devise, and thin is against the Lord's people, his cause and interest, and so against himself; and though their schemes are formed and contrived with a great deal of subtlety, yet they are commonly blasted; whether laid by particular persons, as by Ahithophel against David; or by nations, whole bodies of men, as of the Egyptians and Assyrians against Israel; and of Jews and Gentiles against Christ and his cause; <p>he maketh the devices of the people of none effect; the same thing is expressed here as before, in different words, for the further confirmation of it, and that it might be attended to. This is the Lord's doing, he is omniscient, and knows all the secret plots and designs of men; and he is omnipotent, and counteracts them, and confounds them in all their measures; and is faithful to his people, cause, and interest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD bringeth the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</span><p>(g) No counsel can prevail against God, but he deserves it, and it will have evil success.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">bringeth … maketh</span>] Or, <span class="ital">hath brought … hath made</span>, with particular reference to some recent event.

The summons to praise God is supported (1) by a setting forth of His praiseworthiness <p>(Note: We have adopted the word "praiseworthiness" for the sake of conciseness of expression, in order to avoid an awkward periphrasis, in the sense of being worthy to be praised. - Tr.)<p>(a) as the God of revelation in the kingdom of Grace. His word is &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, upright in intention, and, without becoming in any way whatever untrue to itself, straightway fulfilling itself. His every act is an act in &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, truth, which verifies the truth of His word, and one which accomplishes itself.
