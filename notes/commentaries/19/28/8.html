Let us then bless his name. The Lord is my strength, to support me, and carry me on through all my services and sufferings. The heart that truly believes, shall in due time greatly rejoice: we are to expect joy and peace in believing. God shall have the praise of it: thus must we express our gratitude. The saints rejoice in others' comfort as well as their own: we have the less benefit from the light of the sun, nor from the light of God's countenance, for others' sharing therein. The psalmist concludes with a short, but comprehensive prayer. God's people are his inheritance, and precious in his eyes. He prays that God would save them; that he would bless them with all good, especially the plenty of his ordinances, which are food to the soul. And direct their actions and overrule their affairs for good. Also, lift them up for ever; not only those of that age, but his people in every age to come; lift them up as high as heaven. There, and there only, will saints be lifted up for ever, never more to sink, or be depressed. Save us, Lord Jesus, from our sins; bless us, thou Son of Abraham, with the blessing of righteousness; feed us, thou good Shepherd of the sheep, and lift us up for ever from the dust, O thou, who art the Resurrection and the Life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is their strength - Margin, "his strength." The Hebrew is, "their strength," or "strength to them." The allusion is to the people of God. The course of thought seems to be, that the psalmist, having derived in his own case assistance from God, or having found God a strength to him, his mind turns from this fact to the general idea that God was the strength of "all" who were in similar circumstancaes; or that all His people might confide in Him as he had done.<p>And he is the saving strength - Margin, as in Hebrew, "strength of salvations." That is, In Him is found the strength which produces salvation. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>.<p>Of his anointed - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-6.htm">Psalm 20:6</a>, note. The primary reference here is doubtless to the psalmist himself, as one who had been annointed or set apaart to the kingly office; but the connection shows that he intended to include all the people of God, as those whom He had consecrated or set apart to His service.

The welfare of David and that of the people are bound up together.

It was with this object that he chose him out of all Israel, and took him from the sheepfolds, and had him anointed king - that he might "feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This first half of the Psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>) is supplicatory. The preposition &#1502;&#1503; in connection with the verbs &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to be deaf, dumb, and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, to keep silence, is a pregnant form of expression denoting an aversion or turning away which does not deign to give the suppliant an answer. Jahve is his &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, his ground of confidence; but if He continues thus to keep silence, then he who confides in Him will become like those who are going down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>), or are gone down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>) to the pit. The participle of the past answers better to the situation of one already on the brink of the abyss. In the double sentence with &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, the chief accent falls upon the second clause, for which the first only paratactically opens up the way (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>); in Latin it would be ne, te mihi non respondente, similis fiam. Olshausen, and Baur with him, believes that because &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has not the accent on the ultima as being perf. consec., it must be interpreted according to the accentuation thus, "in order that Thou mayst no longer keep silence, whilst I am already become like..." But this ought to be &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, or at least &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. And if &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; were to be taken as a real perfect, it would then rather have to be rendered "and I should then be like." But, notwithstanding &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is Milel, it is still perf. consecuticum ("and I am become like"); for if, in a sentence of more than one member following upon &#1508;&#1503;, the fut., as is usually the case (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>), goes over into the perf., then the latter, in most instances, has the tone of the perf. consec.

The penultima-accentuation is necessarily retained in connection with the two great pausal accents, Silluk and Athnach, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>; in this passage in connection with Rebia mugrash, just as we may say, in general, the perf. consec. sometimes retains its penultima-accentuation in connection with distinctives instead of being accented on the ultima; e.g., in connection with Rebia mugrash, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>; with Rebia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-14.htm">Proverbs 19:14</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-17.htm">Ezekiel 14:17</a>); with Zakeph. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-8.htm">1 Samuel 29:8</a>; and even with Tiphcha Obad. Oba 1:10, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-21.htm">Joel 3:21</a>. The national grammarians are ignorant of any law on this subject.<p>(Note: Aben-Ezra (Moznajim 36b) explains the perfect accented on the penult. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a> from the conformity of sound, and Kimchi (Michlol 6b) simply records the phenomenon.)<p>The point towards which the psalmist stretches forth his hands in prayer is Jahve's holy &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;. Such is the word (after the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503;) used only in the Books of Kings and Chronicles, with the exception of this passage, to denote the Holy of Holies, not as being &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (Aquila and Symmachus), or &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, oraculum (Jerome), as it were, Jahve's audience chamber (Hengstenberg) - a meaning that is not in accordance with the formation of the word, - but as the hinder part of the tent, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, Arabic dabara, to be behind, whence dubr (Talmudic &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;), that which is behind (opp. kubl. kibal, that which is in the front), cf. Jesurun p. 87f. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/28-3.htm">Psalm 28:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-4.htm">Psalm 28:4</a> the prayer is expanded. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; (instead of which we find &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-9.htm">Psalm 26:9</a>), to draw any one down forcibly to destruction, or to drag him to the place of judgment, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-20.htm">Ezekiel 32:20</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a>. The delineation of the ungodly David borrows from his actual foes, Should he succumb to them, then his fate would be like that which awaits them, to whom he is conscious that he is radically unlike. He therefore prays that God's recompensing justice may anticipate him, i.e., that He may requite them according to their desert, before he succumbs, to whom they have feigned &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, a good understanding, or being on good terms, whereas they cherished in their heart the &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; that is now unmasked (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>). &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, used of an official adjudication, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>. The epanaphora of &#1514;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1500;&#1492;&#1501; is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>.<p>(Note: This repetition, at the end, of a significant word that has been used at the beginning of a verse, is a favourite custom of Isaiah's (Comment. S. 387; transl. ii.134).)<p>The phrase &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;), which occurs frequently in the prophets, signifies to recompense or repay to any one his accomplishing, his manifestation, that is to say, what he has done and merited; the thoughts and expression call to mind more particularly <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>. The right to pray for recompense (vengeance) is grounded, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, upon their blindness to God's just and merciful rule as it is to be seen in human history (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>). The contrast of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1495;&#1512;&#1505;, to pull down (with a personal object, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>), is like Jeremiah's style (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a>, cf. 1:10; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, and frequently, Sir. 49:7). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, the prominent thought in David's mind is, that they shamefully fail to recognise how gloriously and graciously God has again and again acknowledged him as His anointed one. He has (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>) received the promise, that God would build him a house, i.e., grant perpetual continuance to his kingship. The Absolomites are in the act of rebellion against this divine appointment. Hence they shall experience the very reverse of the divine promise given to David: Jahve will pull them down and not build them up, He will destroy, at its very commencement, this dynasty set up in opposition to God. </body></html>
