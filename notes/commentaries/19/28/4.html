A general notice of the imprecations of the Psalms will be found in the General Introduction (VI.). Here it is enough to remark that there is no indication of personal animosity or vindictiveness. The poet, even if expressing his own feelings, was identified with devout Israel, to whom it was natural not only to expect from Jehovah the manifestation of judgment which could alone remove the conditions that were so unfavourable to the true religion, but also to pray that He would at the same time vindicate Himself and justify those faithful to Him. (Comp. for the general thought <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/3-8.htm" title="For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.">Isaiah 3:8-11</a>.) In the actual course of God’s providence, the retribution is often very accurately apportioned to the evil deed, and the Bible contains many strong instances—<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>that of Adonibezek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-5.htm" title="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Judges 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm" title="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.">Judges 1:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-4.htm" title="Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavors: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.">Psalm 28:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Give them according to their deeds, </span>&c. — It is fit that they should suffer as they have acted, and reap the fruit of their manifold wickedness. <span class="ital">Give them after the work of their hands, </span>&c. — Dispense a reward to them according to their works, and deal with them as they have dealt with others. This verse would be better translated in the future; <span class="ital">Thou wilt give, </span>&c. For this prayer is evidently a prophecy, that God will, sooner or later, render to all impenitent sinners according to their deserts: see the next verse, and note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm" title="Destroy you them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against you.">Psalm 5:10</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-5 David is very earnest in prayer. Observe his faith in prayer; God is my rock, on whom I build my hope. Believers should not rest till they have received some token that their prayers are heard. He prays that he may not be numbered with the wicked. Save me from being entangled in the snares they have laid for me. Save me from being infected with their sins, and from doing as they do. Lord, never leave me to use such arts of deceit and treachery for my safety, as they use for my ruin. Believers dread the way of sinners; the best are sensible of the danger they are in of being drawn aside: we should all pray earnestly to God for his grace to keep us. Those who are careful not to partake with sinners in their sins, have reason to hope that they shall not receive their plagues. He speaks of the just judgments of the Lord on the workers of iniquity, ver. 4. This is not the language of passion or revenge. It is a prophecy that there will certainly come a day, when God will punish every man who persists in his evil deeds. Sinners shall be reckoned with, not only for the mischief they have done, but for the mischief they designed, and did what they could to effect. Disregard of the works of the Lord, is the cause of the sin of sinners, and becomes the cause of their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give them according to their deeds - Deal righteously with them. Recompense them as they deserve.<p>And according to the wickedness of their endeavours - Their designs; their works; their plans.<p>Give them after the work of their hands - Reward them according to what they do.<p>Render to them their desert - A just recompense. This whole verse is a prayer that God would deal "justly" with them. There is no evidence that there is anything of vindictiveness or malice in the prayer. In itself considered, there is no impropriety in praying that "justice" may be done to the violators of law.

Add to all this, that as verbs of the imperative mood are oft used by the Hebrews for futures, so these may not be proper imprecations, but predictions of their destruction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Give them according to their deeds,....

The feeling of righteous indignation, naturally implanted in us, causes us to desire the punishment of the wicked, quite apart from any wrong that they may have done to ourselves (Aristotle, 'Rhet.,' 2:1, &sect; 3).

And this is what he prays for. As in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>, &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512; is used in an ethical sense; and differs in this respect from its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-12.htm">Psalm 26:12</a>. On &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, see the primary passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>, of which this is an echo. Wily spies dodge his every step and would gladly see what they have invented against him and wished for him, realised. Should he enter the way of sin leading to destruction, it would tend to the dishonour of God, just as on the contrary it is a matter of honour with God not to let His servant fall. Hence he prays to be led in the way of God, for a oneness of his own will with the divine renders a man inaccessible to evil. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>, is used, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-9.htm">Psalm 17:9</a>, and in the similar passage, which is genuinely Davidic, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a>, in the signification passion or strong desire; because the soul, in its natural state, is selfishness and inordinate desire. &#1497;&#1508;&#1495; is a collateral form of &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495;; they are both adjectives formed from the future of the verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (like &#1497;&#1512;&#1489;, &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;): accustomed to breathe out (exhale), i.e., either to express, or to snort, breathe forth (cf. &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, or &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; and &#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, and the like, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1</a>). In both Hitzig sees participles of &#1497;&#1508;&#1495; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-31.htm">Jeremiah 4:31</a>); but <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> lead back to &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;); and Hupfeld rightly recognises such nouns formed from futures to be, according to their original source, circumlocutions of the participle after the manner of an elliptical relative clause (the s&#803;ifat of the Arabic syntax), and explains &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495; &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, together with &#1497;&#1508;&#1495; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, from the verbal construction which still continues in force. </body></html>
