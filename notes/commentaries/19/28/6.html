Others regard the psalm as composed by the union of two distinct pieces. Others again treat <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-6.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplications.">Psalm 28:6</a> as an interpolation.

Let us then bless his name. The Lord is my strength, to support me, and carry me on through all my services and sufferings. The heart that truly believes, shall in due time greatly rejoice: we are to expect joy and peace in believing. God shall have the praise of it: thus must we express our gratitude. The saints rejoice in others' comfort as well as their own: we have the less benefit from the light of the sun, nor from the light of God's countenance, for others' sharing therein. The psalmist concludes with a short, but comprehensive prayer. God's people are his inheritance, and precious in his eyes. He prays that God would save them; that he would bless them with all good, especially the plenty of his ordinances, which are food to the soul. And direct their actions and overrule their affairs for good. Also, lift them up for ever; not only those of that age, but his people in every age to come; lift them up as high as heaven. There, and there only, will saints be lifted up for ever, never more to sink, or be depressed. Save us, Lord Jesus, from our sins; bless us, thou Son of Abraham, with the blessing of righteousness; feed us, thou good Shepherd of the sheep, and lift us up for ever from the dust, O thou, who art the Resurrection and the Life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications - This is one of those passages which frequently occur in the Psalms, when there has been an earnest and anxious prayer offered to God, and when the answer to the prayer seems to be immediate. The mind of the anxious and troubled pleader becomes calm; the promises of God are brought directly to the soul; the peace which was sought is obtained; and he who began the psalm with deep anxiety and trouble of mind, rejoices at the close of it in the evidences of the divine favor and love. What thus happened to the psalmist frequently occurs now. The answer to prayer, so far as giving calmness and assurance to the mind is concerned, is often immediate. The troubled spirit becomes calm; and whatever may be the result in other respects, the heart is made peaceful and confiding, and feels the assurance that all will be well. It is sufficient for us to feel that God hears us, for if this is so, we have the assurance that all is right. In this sense, certainly, it is right to look for an immediate answer to our prayers. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>, note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. supplications&#8212;or, "cries for mercy."<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/28.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>6 Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.<p>7 The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.<p>8 The Lord is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-6.htm">Psalm 28:6</a><p>"Blessed be the Lord." Saints are full of benedictions; they are a blessed people, and a blessing people; but they give their best blessings, the fat of their sacrifices, to their glorious Lord. Our Psalm was prayer up to this point, and now it turns to praise. They who pray well, will soon praise well: prayer and praise are the two lips of the soul; two bells to ring out sweet and acceptable music in the ears of God; two angels to climb Jacob's ladder; two altars smoking with incense; two of Solomon's lilies dropping sweet-smelling myrrh; they are two young roes that are twins, feeding upon the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense. "Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications." Real praise is established upon sufficient and constraining reasons; it is not irrational emotion, but rises, like a pure spring, from the deeps of experience. Answered prayers should be acknowledged. Do we not often fail in this duty? Would it not greatly encourage others, and strengthen ourselves, if we faithfully recorded divine goodness, and made a point of extolling it with our tongue? God's mercy is not such an inconsiderable thing that we may safely venture to receive it without so much as thanks. We should shun ingratitude, and live daily in the heavenly atmosphere of thankful love.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a><p>Here is David's declaration and confession of faith, coupled with a testimony from his experience. "The Lord is my strength." The Lord employs his power on our behalf, and moreover, infuses strength into us in our hour of weakness. The Psalmist, by an act of appropriating faith, takes the omnipotence of Jehovah to be his own. Dependence upon the invisible God gives great independence of spirit, inspiring us with confidence more than human. "And my shield." Thus David found both sword and shield in his God. The Lord preserves his people from unnumbered ills; and the Christian warrior, sheltered behind his God is far more safe than the hero when covered with his shield of brass or triple steel. "My heart trusted in him, and I am helped." Heart work is sure work; heart trust is never disappointed. Faith must come before help, but help will never be long behind. Every day the believer may say, "I am helped," for the divine assistance is vouchsafed us every moment, or we should go back unto perdition; when more manifest help is needed, we have but to put faith into exercise, and it will be given us. "Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him." The heart is mentioned twice to show the truth of his faith and his joy. Observe the adverb "greatly," we need not be afraid of being too full of rejoicing at the remembrance of grace received. We serve a great God, let us greatly rejoice in him. A song is the soul's fittest method of giving vent to its happiness, it were well if we were more like the singing lark, and less like the croaking raven. When the heart is glowing, the lips should not be silent. When God blesses us we should bless him with all our heart.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a><p>"The Lord is their strength." - The heavenly experience of one believer is a pattern of the life of all. To all the militant church, without exception, Jehovah is the same as he was to his servant David, "the least of them shall be as David." They need the same aid and they shall have it, for they are loved with the same love, written in the same book of life, and one with the same anointed Head. "And he is the saving strength of his anointed." Here behold king David as the type of our Lord Jesus, our covenant Head, our anointed Prince, through whom all blessings come to us. He has achieved full salvation for us, and we desire saving strength from him, and as we share in the unction which is so largely shed upon him, we expect to partake in his salvation. Glory be unto the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has magnified the power of his grace in his only begotten Son, whom he has anointed to be a Prince and a Saviour unto his people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He speaks of it as past, either because God had in part heard and answered him already, or because God assured him by his Spirit that he had heard and accepted his prayers, and would assuredly answer him in due time. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Blessed be the Lord,.... Which must be understood, not as invoking nor as conferring a blessing on him, neither of which can be done by a creature; nor does he stand in need of any, he being Elshaddai, God all sufficient, God over all, blessed for ever; but as ascribing all blessedness to him, congratulating his greatness and happiness, and giving him praise and glory for mercies received; and particularly for the following: <p>because he hath heard the voice of my supplications; what he had prayed for, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; an answer was quickly returned, even while he was speaking, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>; though this may be an expression of faith, being fully persuaded and assured that he was heard, and would be answered, and may be said by a prophetic spirit; knowing that what he had humbly asked for would be granted; so Aben Ezra and Kimchi understand it in a way of prophecy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{f}</span> Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.</span><p>(f) Because he felt the assurance of God's help in his heart, his mouth was opened to sing his praises.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6, 7</span>. Thanksgiving succeeds to prayer. Are we to suppose that faith realises the answer to its prayer as already granted, and can give thanks accordingly? or that this conclusion was added by the Psalmist subsequently as a grateful memorial of his deliverance? Either alternative is possible; but here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/31-21.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD: for he has showed me his marvelous kindness in a strong city....">Psalm 31:21-24</a> we seem to have a record of actual deliverance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm" title="Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.">Psalm 6:8</a> ff. is somewhat different.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - As, midway in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>, the tone changed from jubilation to humble entreaty, so, midway in the present psalm, there is a change from plaintive and humble entreaty to rejoicing and thanksgiving. The cause of the change would seem to have been a confident assurance, arising out of the very act of prayer, that the prayer is heard and granted, so that the happy results prayed for are certain to follow. Such an assurance is certainly not attained by all those whose supplications are earnest and devout; but David appears to have enjoyed it not infrequently (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications</span> (comp. ver. 2, with which this is, of set purpose, made exactly to correspond). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Self-encouragement to firmer confidence of faith. Joined to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a> (Aben-Ezra, Kimchi), <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a> trails badly after it. We must, with Geier, Dachselt, and others, suppose that the apodosis is wanting to the protasis with its &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; pointed with three points above,<p>(Note: The &#1493; has not any point above it, because it might be easily mistaken for a Cholem, vid., Baer's Psalterium p. 130.)<p>and four below, according to the Masora (cf. B. Berachoth 4a), but a word which is indispensably necessary, and is even attested by the lxx (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;) and the Targum (although not by any other of the ancient versions); cf. the protasis with &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, which has no apodosis, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-15.htm">Genesis 50:15</a>, and the apodoses with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; after &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-10.htm">Genesis 43:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/35-34.htm">1 Samuel 35:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-27.htm">2 Samuel 2:27</a> (also <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-33.htm">Numbers 22:33</a>, where &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;  equals  &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;), which are likewise to be explained per aposiopesin. The perfect after &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; (&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;) has sometimes the sense of a plusquamperfectum (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-10.htm">Genesis 43:10</a>, nisi cunctati essemus), and sometimes the sense of an imperfect, as in the present passage (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-29.htm">Deuteronomy 32:29</a>, si saperent). The poet does not speak of a faith that he once had, a past faith, but, in regard to the danger that is even now abiding and present, of the faith he now has, a present faith. The apodosis ought to run something like this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-92.htm">Psalm 119:92</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-17.htm">Psalm 94:17</a>): did I not believe, were not confidence preserved to me...then (&#1488;&#1494;( ne or &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1494;) I should perish; or: then I had suddenly perished. But he has such faith, and he accordingly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a> encourages himself to go on cheerfully waiting and hoping; he speaks to himself, it is, as it were, the believing half of his soul addressing the despondent and weaker half. Instead of &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1509; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>) the expression is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-25.htm">Psalm 31:25</a>, &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1509; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498;, let thy heart be strong, let it give proof of strength. The rendering "May He (Jahve) strengthen thy heart" would require &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509;; but &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1509;, as e.g., &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1489; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-17.htm">Psalm 25:17</a>, belongs to the transitive denominatives applying to the mind or spirit, in which the Hebrew is by no means poor, and in which the Arabic is especially rich. </body></html>
