The heart that truly believes, shall in due time greatly rejoice: we are to expect joy and peace in believing. God shall have the praise of it: thus must we express our gratitude. The saints rejoice in others' comfort as well as their own: we have the less benefit from the light of the sun, nor from the light of God's countenance, for others' sharing therein. The psalmist concludes with a short, but comprehensive prayer. God's people are his inheritance, and precious in his eyes. He prays that God would save them; that he would bless them with all good, especially the plenty of his ordinances, which are food to the soul. And direct their actions and overrule their affairs for good. Also, lift them up for ever; not only those of that age, but his people in every age to come; lift them up as high as heaven. There, and there only, will saints be lifted up for ever, never more to sink, or be depressed.

The psalm appropriately closes with a prayer for all the people of God. The prayer is offered in view of the deliverance which the psalmist had himself experienced, and he prays that all the people of God might experience similar deliverance and mercy.<p>And bless thine inheritance - Thy heritage; Thy people. The Hebrew word properly means "taking possession of anything; occupation." Then it comes to mean "possession; domain; estate:" Num, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-21.htm">Psalm 18:21</a>. Thus it is used as applied to the territory assigned to each tribe in the promised land: <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-23.htm">Joshua 13:23</a>. Thus also it is applied to the people of Israel - the Jewish nation - as the "possession" or "property" of Yahweh; as a people whom he regarded as His own, and whom, as such, He protected: <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-29.htm">Deuteronomy 9:29</a>. In this place the people of God are thus spoken of as His special possession or property on earth; as that which He regards as of most value to Him; as that which belongs to Him, or to which He has a claim; as that which cannot without injustice to Him be alienated from Him.<p>Feed them also - Margin, "rule." The Hebrew word refers to the care which a shepherd extends over his flock. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, where the same word, under another form - "shepherd" - is used. The prayer is, that God would take the same care of His people that a shepherd takes of his flock.<p>And lift them up for ever - The word used here may mean "sustain" them, or "support" them; but it more properly means "bear," and would be best expressed by a reference to the fact that the shepherd carries the feeble, the young, and the sickly of his flock in his arms, or that he lifts them up when unable themselves to rise. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, note. The word "forever" here means simply "always" - in all circumstances; at all times. In other words, the psalmist prays that God would "always" manifest Himself as the Friend and Helper of His people, as He had done to him. It may be added here, that what the psalmist thus prays for God's "will" to be done. God "will" save His people; He will bless His heritage; He will be to them a kind and faithful shepherd; He will sustain, comfort, uphold, and cherish them always - in affliction; in temptation; in death, forever. They have only to trust in Him, and they will find Him to be more kind and faithful than the most tender shepherd ever was to his flock. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

We must pray for the whole church, and not for ourselves alone. "Save thy people." Deliver them from their enemies, preserve them from their sins, succour them under their troubles, rescue them from their temptations, and ward off from them every ill. There is a plea hidden in the expression, "thy people;" for it may be safely concluded that God's interest in the church, as his own portion, will lead him to guard it from destruction. "Bless thine inheritance." Grant positive blessings, peace, plenty, prosperity, happiness; make all thy dearly-purchased and precious heritage to be comforted by thy Spirit. Revive, refresh, enlarge and sanctify thy church. "Feed them also." Be a shepherd to thy flock, let their bodily and spiritual wants be plentifully supplied. By thy word, and ordinances, direct, rule, sustain, and satisfy those who are the sheep of thy hand. "And lift them up for ever." Carry them in thine arms on earth, and then lift them into thy bosom in heaven. Elevate their minds and thoughts, spiritualise their affections, make them heavenly, Christlike, and full of God. O Lord, answer this our petition, for Jesus' sake. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thine inheritance; </span> Israel, for whom I pray; partly because thou hast in some sort committed them to my charge, and partly because Saul did not take due care of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lift them up; </span> raise them out of their low and afflicted condition, in which they are, by reason of Saul’s weakness and neglect, and by the prevailing power of the Philistines, and advance them to a state of safety and honour, and that not for a season, but with constancy and perpetuity, as it follows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Save thy people,....

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm" title="And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/46-3.htm" title="Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:...">Isaiah 46:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm" title="In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.">Isaiah 63:9</a>.

"In conclusion, the psalmist prays that the Lord would do eternally that which he had done now" (Hengstenberg) - "save" and "bless" his people  - keep them from evil, and give them all that is good. Feed them also. As a shepherd does his flock (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1, 2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>). And lift them up for ever. Some explain the" lifting up" as carrying in his arms over rough places - a prolongation of the shepherd metaphor (Kay; 'Speaker's Commentary'); but, perhaps, the more ordinary meaning of the Hebrew word - "exalt," "lift up on high," "raise above others" - which is preferred by Bishop Horsley, Rosenmuller, and Hengstenberg, is intended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This first half of the Psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>) is supplicatory. The preposition &#1502;&#1503; in connection with the verbs &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to be deaf, dumb, and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, to keep silence, is a pregnant form of expression denoting an aversion or turning away which does not deign to give the suppliant an answer. Jahve is his &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, his ground of confidence; but if He continues thus to keep silence, then he who confides in Him will become like those who are going down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>), or are gone down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>) to the pit. The participle of the past answers better to the situation of one already on the brink of the abyss. In the double sentence with &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, the chief accent falls upon the second clause, for which the first only paratactically opens up the way (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>); in Latin it would be ne, te mihi non respondente, similis fiam. Olshausen, and Baur with him, believes that because &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has not the accent on the ultima as being perf. consec., it must be interpreted according to the accentuation thus, "in order that Thou mayst no longer keep silence, whilst I am already become like..." But this ought to be &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, or at least &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. And if &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; were to be taken as a real perfect, it would then rather have to be rendered "and I should then be like." But, notwithstanding &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is Milel, it is still perf. consecuticum ("and I am become like"); for if, in a sentence of more than one member following upon &#1508;&#1503;, the fut., as is usually the case (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>), goes over into the perf., then the latter, in most instances, has the tone of the perf. consec. (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-9.htm">Proverbs 5:9-12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>), but not always. The penultima-accentuation is necessarily retained in connection with the two great pausal accents, Silluk and Athnach, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>; in this passage in connection with Rebia mugrash, just as we may say, in general, the perf. consec. sometimes retains its penultima-accentuation in connection with distinctives instead of being accented on the ultima; e.g., in connection with Rebia mugrash, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>; with Rebia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-14.htm">Proverbs 19:14</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-17.htm">Ezekiel 14:17</a>); with Zakeph. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-8.htm">1 Samuel 29:8</a>; and even with Tiphcha Obad. Oba 1:10, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-21.htm">Joel 3:21</a>. The national grammarians are ignorant of any law on this subject.<p>(Note: Aben-Ezra (Moznajim 36b) explains the perfect accented on the penult. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a> from the conformity of sound, and Kimchi (Michlol 6b) simply records the phenomenon.)<p>The point towards which the psalmist stretches forth his hands in prayer is Jahve's holy &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;. Such is the word (after the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503;) used only in the Books of Kings and Chronicles, with the exception of this passage, to denote the Holy of Holies, not as being &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (Aquila and Symmachus), or &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, oraculum (Jerome), as it were, Jahve's audience chamber (Hengstenberg) - a meaning that is not in accordance with the formation of the word, - but as the hinder part of the tent, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, Arabic dabara, to be behind, whence dubr (Talmudic &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;), that which is behind (opp. kubl. kibal, that which is in the front), cf.

The delineation of the ungodly David borrows from his actual foes, Should he succumb to them, then his fate would be like that which awaits them, to whom he is conscious that he is radically unlike. He therefore prays that God's recompensing justice may anticipate him, i.e., that He may requite them according to their desert, before he succumbs, to whom they have feigned &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, a good understanding, or being on good terms, whereas they cherished in their heart the &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; that is now unmasked (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>). &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, used of an official adjudication, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>. The epanaphora of &#1514;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1500;&#1492;&#1501; is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>.<p>(Note: This repetition, at the end, of a significant word that has been used at the beginning of a verse, is a favourite custom of Isaiah's (Comment.

The right to pray for recompense (vengeance) is grounded, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, upon their blindness to God's just and merciful rule as it is to be seen in human history (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>). The contrast of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1495;&#1512;&#1505;, to pull down (with a personal object, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>), is like Jeremiah's style (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a>, cf. 1:10; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, and frequently, Sir. 49:7). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, the prominent thought in David's mind is, that they shamefully fail to recognise how gloriously and graciously God has again and again acknowledged him as His anointed one. He has (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>) received the promise, that God would build him a house, i.e., grant perpetual continuance to his kingship. The Absolomites are in the act of rebellion against this divine appointment. Hence they shall experience the very reverse of the divine promise given to David: Jahve will pull them down and not build them up, He will destroy, at its very commencement, this dynasty set up in opposition to God. </body></html>
