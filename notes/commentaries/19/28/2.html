Observe his faith in prayer; God is my rock, on whom I build my hope. Believers should not rest till they have received some token that their prayers are heard. He prays that he may not be numbered with the wicked. Save me from being entangled in the snares they have laid for me. Save me from being infected with their sins, and from doing as they do. Lord, never leave me to use such arts of deceit and treachery for my safety, as they use for my ruin. Believers dread the way of sinners; the best are sensible of the danger they are in of being drawn aside: we should all pray earnestly to God for his grace to keep us. Those who are careful not to partake with sinners in their sins, have reason to hope that they shall not receive their plagues. He speaks of the just judgments of the Lord on the workers of iniquity, ver. 4. This is not the language of passion or revenge. It is a prophecy that there will certainly come a day, when God will punish every man who persists in his evil deeds. Sinners shall be reckoned with, not only for the mischief they have done, but for the mischief they designed, and did what they could to effect. Disregard of the works of the Lord, is the cause of the sin of sinners, and becomes the cause of their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear the voice of my supplications - It was not mental prayer which he offered; it was a petition uttered audibly.<p>When I lift up my hands - To lift up the hands denotes supplication, as this was a common attitude in prayer. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>.<p>Toward thy holy oracle - Margin, as in Hebrew, "toward the oracle of thy holiness." The word "oracle" as used here denotes the place where the answer to prayer is given. The Hebrew word - &#1491;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;  deb&#305;&#770;yr - means properly the inner sanctuary of the tabernacle or the temple, the place where God was supposed to reside, and where He gave responses to the prayers of His people: the same place which is elsewhere called the holy of holies. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-3.htm">Hebrews 9:3-14</a>. The Hebrew word is found only here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-19.htm">1 Kings 6:19-23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-6.htm">1 Kings 8:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-16.htm">2 Chronicles 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-20.htm">2 Chronicles 4:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-9.htm">2 Chronicles 5:9</a>. The idea here is that he who prayed stretched out his hands toward that sacred place where God was supposed to dwell. So we stretch out our hands toward heaven - the sacred dwelling-place of God. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>. The Hebrew word is probably derived from the verb to "speak;" and, according to this derivation, the idea is that God spoke to His people; that he "communed" with them; that He answered their prayers from that sacred recess - His special dwelling-place.

The Hiph. &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; signifies in this passage standing by itself (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-4.htm">Job 24:4</a>): to push aside. The clause &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514; does not say: be Thou my help (which is impossible on syntactical grounds), nor is it to be taken relatively: Thou who wast my help (for which there is no ground in what precedes); but on the contrary the praet. gives the ground of the request that follows "Thou art my help (lit., Thou has become, or hast ever been) - cast me, then, not away," and it is, moreover, accented accordingly. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>, as we have already observed, does not sound as though it came from the lips of David, of whom it is only said during the time of his persecution by Saul, that at that time he was obliged to part from his parents, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-3.htm">1 Samuel 22:3</a>. The words certainly might be David's, if <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a> would admit of being taken hypothetically, as is done by Ewald, &#1431;362, b: should my father and my mother forsake me, yet Jahve will etc. But the entreaty "forsake me not" is naturally followed by the reason: for my father and my mother have forsaken me; and just as naturally does the consolation: but Jahve will take me up, prepare the way for the entreaties which begin anew in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>. Whereas, if &#1499;&#1497; is taken hypothetically, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a> stands disconnectedly in the midst of the surrounding requests.
