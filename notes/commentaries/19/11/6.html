Dr. Waterland reads the verse thus: <span class="ital">Upon the wicked he shall rain snares: fire and brimstone, and a tempestuous wind shall be the portion of their cup. </span>The psalmist alludes to the fire and brimstone which fell upon the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. By <span class="ital">snares </span>are meant grievous plagues or calamities, which are called <span class="ital">snares, </span>because wicked men are often surprised with them when they least expect it, and because they cannot escape them, or extricate themselves from them; but are held fast and destroyed by them. And God is said to <span class="ital">rain </span>them, to denote his sending them plentifully, swiftly, and suddenly, as rain commonly falls from heaven. <span class="ital">And a horrible tempest — </span>Dreadful judgments, so called in allusion to the destruction of the forementioned cities by these means. But he seems to intend this, not so much of present calamities, as of eternal punishments, to commence at the judgment of the last day. “Then the children of faithful Abraham shall behold a prospect, like that which once presented itself to the eyes of their father; when, rising early in the morning, and looking toward Sodom and Gomorrah, <span class="ital">he beheld, and lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace! </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-28.htm" title="And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, see, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.">Genesis 19:28</a>. Such must be the <span class="ital">portion of their cup </span>who have dashed from them the cup of salvation. He, therefore, who enjoys the prosperity of the wicked here, must take with it their torment hereafter; as he who is ambitious of wearing the crown of righteousness in heaven must be content to endure tribulation upon earth.” — Horne. The reader will observe, that this expression, <span class="ital">the portion of their cup, </span>is a proverbial phrase in Scripture: God’s gifts and dispensations, whether pleasing or painful, consolatory or afflictive, especially the latter, being ordinarily expressed by a <span class="ital">cup, </span>poured out and given men to drink.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-7 David's struggle with, and triumph over a strong temptation to distrust God, and betake himself to indirect means for his own safety, in a time of danger.  - Those that truly fear God and serve him, are welcome to put their trust in him. The psalmist, before he gives an account of his temptation to distrust God, records his resolution to trust in Him, as that by which he was resolved to live and die. The believer, though not terrified by his enemies, may be tempted, by the fears of his friends, to desert his post, or neglect his work. They perceive his danger, but not his security; they give him counsel that savours of worldly policy, rather than of heavenly wisdom. The principles of religion are the foundations on which the faith and hope of the righteous are built. We are concerned to hold these fast against all temptations to unbelief; for believers would be undone, if they had not God to go to, God to trust in, and future bliss to hope for. The prosperity of wicked people in their wicked, evil ways, and the straits and distresses which the best men are sometimes brought into, tried David's faith. We need not say, Who shall go up to heaven, to fetch us thence a God to trust in? The word is nigh us, and God in the word; his Spirit is in his saints, those living temples, and the Lord is that Spirit. This God governs the world. We may know what men seem to be, but God knows what they are, as the refiner knows the value of gold when he has tried it. God is said to try with his eyes, because he cannot err, or be imposed upon. If he afflicts good people, it is for their trial, therefore for their good. However persecutors and oppressors may prosper awhile, they will for ever perish. God is a holy God, and therefore hates them. He is a righteous Judge, and will therefore punish them. In what a horrible tempest are the wicked hurried away at death! Every man has the portion of his cup assigned him. Impenitent sinner, mark your doom! The last call to repentance is about to be addressed to you, judgement is at hand; through the gloomy shade of death you pass into the region of eternal wrath. Hasten then, O sinner, to the cross of Christ. How stands the case between God and our souls? Is Christ our hope, our consolation, our security? Then, not otherwise, will the soul be carried through all its difficulties and conflicts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon the wicked - Upon all the wicked.<p>He shall rain - He shall pour down as in a furious tempest.<p>Snares - It seems rather incongruous to speak of raining down "snares, " - understanding by the word snares, as it is used with us, that which entangles, as the snares by which we catch a bird, or by which a wild animal is taken. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8-10</a>. The word used here, however, seems to refer to anything by which one is taken in his career or course, or is involved in difficulties; and the meaning is, that God would arrest or seize upon the wicked, as a wild beast is secured by the snares or the toils of the hunter. By their being sent down as in a "rain," is denoted that such means of their arrest and punishment would exist in abundance, so that they could not escape.<p>Fire and brimstone - There is probably an allusion here to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>. As those cities were eminent for their wickedness, and were destroyed on account of their guilt, they furnished an illustration of the manner in which God would treat the wicked in all future times. As they were destroyed on account of their wickedness, so will all the wicked be destroyed.<p>And an horrible tempest - As a furious blast of wind sweeps away houses and trees, spreading wide desolation, so will the wicked be swept away by the manifestation of the wrath of God.<p>This shall be the portion of their cup - That is, this shall be what they shall drink. See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>. The idea is, that the Lord holds out to them a cup for them to drink - a cup containing a deadly mixture. The allusion is to the mode of administering punishment by a poisonous draught - not an unfrequent mode of punishment in ancient times. The idea in the whole verse is, that the wicked would be destroyed, and that, therefore, there was nothing ultimately to be apprehended from them. God would protect his own friends, and would destroy all those that sought their hurt. In these circumstances the righteous should confide in him as their protector, and not "flee." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The wicked one, the man of sin, antichrist, and upon all that worship the beast and his image, on all persecutors, and upon all wicked men in general: <p>he shall rain snares, fire, and brimstone, and an horrible tempest; this will be in hell, as Jarchi observes. The allusion is to the Lord's raining fire and brimstone from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah, which was an example and emblem of eternal fire; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>. For the beast and the false prophet, and all the antichristian party, and all wicked men, will have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone. The phrases used express the dreadfulness and horribleness of their punishment; the suddenness, violence, and force, with which it will come; and the rise of it, it will be from heaven; God himself will rain this shower of wrath upon them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>; nor will there be any escaping it, it will be inevitable: therefore "snares" are said to be "rained"; the wicked will be snared in the works of their own hands; they will be taken and held in the cords of their own sins; and full and deserved punishment will be inflicted on them, which will be very severe and terrible. All that is dreadful in a storm is here expressed, even in a storm of fire. The word rendered "snares" is by some thought to be the same with  "burning coals"; and may signify burning stones, hot thunderbolts; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a>; "fire" may signify lightning, with its dreadful flashes, and which burn and consume in an instant; and "brimstone" the nauseous scent and smell, which always attend lightning and thunder, as naturalists observe (x): and the words for "an horrible tempest" signify a burning wind: so that they all serve to convey horrible ideas of the punishment of the wicked in hell. The Targum calls them "showers of vengeance"; <p>this shall be the portion of their cup; which will be measured out to them in proportion to their sins, and which God, in righteous judgment, has appointed for them; and which they shall all drink of, and wring out the very dregs of it. <p>(x) Senecae Nat.

The language is borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm" title="Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;">Genesis 19:24</a>. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm" title="And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm" title="And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain on him, and on his bands, and on the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.">Ezekiel 38:22</a>. The ‘snares’ are to entangle them so that they cannot escape from the fire which consumes, and the fatal simoom which suffocates.

On Divine displeasure follows  Divine punishment - not always speedy, but sure. Those who have plotted against David will have" snares rained" upon them. God is said to "rain" on men both his blessings and his curses, when he gives them abundantly (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-26.htm">Ezekiel 34:26</a>). By "snares" are meant any difficulties or troubles in which men are entangled by the action of Divine providence. <span class="cmt_word">Fire and brimstone</span>.

A similar play of words was attempted before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20</a> &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;. The Hebrew verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1509; signifies both to give way to fear, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-21.htm">Deuteronomy 7:21</a>, and to put in fear, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12</a>. It does mean "to defy, rebel against," although it might have this meaning according to the Arabic &#8219;rd&#803; (to come in the way, withstand, according to which Wetzstein explains &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-6.htm">Job 30:6</a>, like Arab. &#8219;ird&#803;, "a valley that runs slantwise across a district, a gorge that blocks up the traveller's way"<p>(Note: Zeitschrift fr Allgem. Erdkunde xviii. (1865) 1, S. 30.)). <p>It is related to Arab. &#8219;rs&#803;, to vibrate, tremble (e.g., of lightning). </body></html>
