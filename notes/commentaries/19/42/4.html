In the way wherein I walked have they privately laid a snare for me.">Psalm 142:3</a>). But the Authorised Version is better, “when I think of it, my heart must overflow.” The expression, “I pour out my soul upon me,” may, however, mean, “I weep floods of tears over myself,” <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, “over my lot.”<p><span class= "bld">For I had gone with the multitude.</span>—The LXX. and Vulg., as well as the strangeness of the words rendered “multitude” and “went with them,” indicate a corruption of the text. Fortunately the general sense and reference of the verse are independent of the doubtful expressions. The poet indulges in a grateful recollection of some great festival, probably the Feast of Tabernacles. (See LXX.)<p><span class= "bld">That kept holyday.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">dancing </span>or <span class= "ital">reeling. </span>But the word is used absolutely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm" title="And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.">Exodus 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-41.htm" title="And you shall keep it a feast to the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.">Leviticus 23:41</a>) for keeping a festival, and especially the Feast of Tabernacles. Dancing appears to have been a recognised part of the ceremonial. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2Samuel 6:16</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/42.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>42:1-5 The psalmist looked to the Lord as his chief good, and set his heart upon him accordingly; casting anchor thus at first, he rides out the storm. A gracious soul can take little satisfaction in God's courts, if it do not meet with God himself there. Living souls never can take up their rest any where short of a living God. To appear before the Lord is the desire of the upright, as it is the dread of the hypocrite. Nothing is more grievous to a gracious soul, than what is intended to shake its confidence in the Lord. It was not the remembrance of the pleasures of his court that afflicted David; but the remembrance of the free access he formerly had to God's house, and his pleasure in attending there. Those that commune much with their own hearts, will often have to chide them. See the cure of sorrow. When the soul rests on itself, it sinks; if it catches hold on the power and promise of God, the head is kept above the billows. And what is our support under present woes but this, that we shall have comfort in Him. We have great cause to mourn for sin; but being cast down springs from unbelief and a rebellious will; we should therefore strive and pray against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I remember these things - These sorrows; this banishment from the house of God; these reproaches of my enemies. The verb used here is in the future tense, and would be appropriately rendered "I will remember these things, and I will pour out my soul within me." That is, it is not a mere recollection of the past, but it indicates a state or purpose of mind - a solemn resolution to bear these things ever in remembrance, and to allow them to produce a proper impression on his mind and heart that would not be effaced by time. Though the future tense is used as denoting what the state of his mind would be, the immediate reference is to the past. The sorrows and afflictions which had overwhelmed him were the things he would remember.<p>I pour out my soul in me - Hebrew, upon me. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-16.htm">Job 30:16</a>. The idea is derived from the fact that the soul in grief seems to be dissolved, or to lose all firmness, consistency, or power, and to be like water. We speak now of the soul as being melted, tender, dissolved, with sympathy or grief, or as overflowing with joy.<p>For I had gone with the multitude - The word here rendered "multitude" - &#1505;&#1498;  sa&#770;k - occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. It is supposed to denote properly a thicket of trees; a thick wood; and then, a crowd of men. The Septuagint renders it, "I will pass on to the place of the wonderful tabernacle," &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  ske&#772;ne&#772;s thaumaste&#772;s. So the Latin Vulgate. Luther translates it, "multitude," Haufen. The Hebrew verb is in the future - "I shall pass," or "when I pass," indicating a confident expectation of a favorable issue of his present trials, and referring not to the fact that he had gone with the multitude in time past, but to the fact that he would be permitted to go with them in solemn procession to the house of God, and that then he would recall these things, and pour out his soul in the fullness of his emotions. The Septuagint renders this in the future; so also the Latin Vulgate, DeWette, and Prof. Alexander. Luther renders it, "For I would gladly go hence with the multitude." It seems clear, therefore, that this does not refer to what had been in the past, but to what he confidently hoped and expected would be in the future. He expected again to go with the multitude to the house of God. Even in his exile, and in his sorrows, he confidently anticipated this, and he says that he would then pour forth the full expression of gratitude - his whole soul - in view of all these things which had occurred. He was now in exile: his heart was overwhelmed with sorrow; he was away from the place of worship - the house of God; he no longer went with others with solemn steps to the sanctuary, but he hoped and expected again to be permitted to do so; and, in view of this, he calls on his soul <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a> not to be cast down. This interpretation, referring it to the future, also brings this part of the psalm into harmony with the subsequent part <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>, where the author of the psalm confidently expresses the same hope.<p>I went with them to the house of God - The tabernacle; the place of public worship. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>. The Hebrew verb here is also in the future tense, and, in accordance with the interpretation above, the meaning is, "I will go," etc. The word occurs only here, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-15.htm">Isaiah 38:15</a>, "I shall go softly all my years." See the word explained in the notes at that passage. It seems here to be used with reference to a movement in a slow and solemn procession, as in the usual processions connected with public worship among the Hebrews. The meaning is, that he would go with the multitude with seriousness and solemnity, as they went up to the house of God to worship.<p>With the voice of joy and praise - Chanting hymns to God.<p>With a multitude that kept holyday - The word here rendered "multitude" - &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;  ha&#770;mo&#770;n - is different from that which is employed in the former part of the verse. This is the usual word to denote a multitude. It literally means a noise or sound, as of rain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41</a>; then, a multitude or crowd making a noise, as of nations, or of an army, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-7.htm">Judges 4:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-11.htm">Daniel 11:11-13</a>. The word rendered "that kept holyday" - &#1495;&#1493;&#1490;&#1490;  choge&#772;g - from &#1495;&#1490;&#1490;  cha&#770;gag, to dance - means literally dancing; dancing in a circle; and then, keeping a festival, celebrating a holyday, as this was done formerly by leaping and dancing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-41.htm">Leviticus 23:41</a>. The meaning is, that he would join with the multitude in the joyful celebrations of public worship. This was the bright anticipation before him in exile; this cheered and sustained his heart when sinking in despair. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.
