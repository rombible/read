David saw troubles coming from God's wrath, and that discouraged him. But if one trouble follow hard after another, if all seem to combine for our ruin, let us remember they are all appointed and overruled by the Lord. David regards the Divine favour as the fountain of all the good he looked for. In the Saviour's name let us hope and pray. One word from him will calm every storm, and turn midnight darkness into the light of noon, the bitterest complaints into joyful praises. Our believing expectation of mercy must quicken our prayers for it. At length, is faith came off conqueror, by encouraging him to trust in the name of the Lord, and to stay himself upon his God. He adds, And my God; this thought enabled him to triumph over all his griefs and fears. Let us never think that the God of our life, and the Rock of our salvation, has forgotten us, if we have made his mercy, truth, and power, our refuge. Thus the psalmist strove against his despondency: at last his faith and hope obtained the victory. Let us learn to check all unbelieving doubts and fears. Apply the promise first to ourselves, and then plead it to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will say unto God my rock - I will appeal to God as my defense, my helper, my Saviour.

Even to repentant sinners God's judgments are apt to seem too severe, too much prolonged, too grievous. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/42.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 42:2-6) The poet compares the thirsting of his soul after God to the thirsting of a stag. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500; (like other names of animals is epicoene, so that there is no necessity to adopt B&#1510;ttcher's emendation &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; &#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1490;) is construed with a feminine predicate in order to indicate the stag (hind) as an image of the soul. &#1506;&#1512;&#1490; is not merely a quiet languishing, but a strong, audible thirsting or panting for water, caused by prevailing drought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; the signification desiderare refers back to the primary notion of inclinare (cf. Arab. 'l-m&#305;&#770;l, the act of inclining), for the primary meaning of the verb Arab. &#8219;rj is to be slanting, inclined or bent, out of which has been developed the signification of ascending and moving upwards, which is transferred in Hebrew to an upward-directed longing. Moreover, it is not with Luther (lxx, Vulgate and authorized version) to be rendered: as the (a) stag crieth, etc., but (and it is accented accordingly): as a stag, which, etc. &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;  equals  &#1488;&#1508;&#1511; is, according to its primary signification, a watercourse holding water (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-16.htm">Psalm 18:16</a>). By the addition of &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; the full and flowing watercourse is distinguished from one that is dried up. &#1506;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1500; point to the difference in the object of the longing, viz., the hind has this object beneath herself, the soul above itself; the longing of the one goes deorsum, the longing of the other sursum. The soul's longing is a thirsting &#1500;&#1488;&#1500; &#1495;&#1497;. Such is the name here applied to God (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>) in the sense in which flowing water is called living, as the spring or fountain of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>) from which flows forth a grace that never dries up, and which stills the thirst of the soul. The spot where this God reveals Himself to him who seeks Him is the sanctuary on Zion: when shall I come and appear in the presence of Elohim?! The expression used in the Law for the three appearings of the Israelites in the sanctuary at solemn feasts is &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492; &#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; or &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-23.htm">Exodus 34:23</a>. Here we find instead of this expression, in accordance with the license of poetic brevity, the bare acc. localis which is even used in other instances in the definition of localities, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a>). Bttcher, Olshausen, and others are of opinion that &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; in the mind of the poet is to be read &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, and that it has only been changed into &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; through the later religious timidity; but the avoidance of the phrase &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492; is explained from the fundamental assumption of the Tra that a man could not behold God's &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; without dying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>. The poet now tells us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a> what the circumstances were which drove him to such intense longing. His customary food does not revive him, tears are his daily bread, which day and night run down upon his mouth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-6.htm">Psalm 80:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-20.htm">Psalm 102:20</a>), and that &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, when say to him, viz., the speakers, all day long, i.e., continually: Where is thy God? Without cessation, these mocking words are continually heard, uttered again and again by those who are found about him, as their thoughts, as it were, in the soul of the poet. This derision, in the Psalms and in the Prophets, is always the keenest sting of pain: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-10.htm">Psalm 79:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-2.htm">Psalm 115:2</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-11.htm">Psalm 71:11</a>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>.<p>In this gloomy present, in which he is made a mock of, as one who is forsaken of God, on account of his trust in the faithfulness of the promises, he calls to remembrance the bright and cheerful past, and he pours out his soul within him (on the &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; used here and further on instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, and as distinguishing between the ego and the soul, vid., Psychol. S. 152; tr. p. 180), inasmuch as he suffers it to melt entirely away in pain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-16.htm">Job 30:16</a>). As in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-4.htm">Psalm 77:4</a>, the cohortatives affirm that he yields himself up most thoroughly to this bittersweet remembrance and to this free outward expression of his pain &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (haecce) points forwards; the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (quod) which follows opens up the expansion of this word. The futures, as expressing the object of the remembrance, state what was a habit in the time past. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; frequently signifies not praeterire, but, without the object that is passed over coming into consideration, porro ire. &#1505;&#1498; (a collateral form of &#1505;&#1498;), properly a thicket, is figuratively (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-17.htm">Isaiah 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>) an interwoven mass, a mixed multitude. The rendering therefore is: that I moved on in a dense crowd (here the distinctive Zinnor). The form &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; is Hithpa., as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-15.htm">Isaiah 38:15</a>, after the form &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; from the verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, "to pass lightly and swiftly along," derived by reduplication from the root &#1491;&#1488; (cf. Arab. d'ud'u), which has the primary meaning to push, to drive (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, pousser), and in various combinations of the &#1491; (&#1491;&#1488;, Arab. dah, &#1491;&#1495;, Arab. da&#8219;, &#1491;&#1489;, &#1491;&#1507;) expresses manifold shades of onward motion in lighter or heavier thrusts or jerks. The suffix, as in &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a> (Ges. 121, 4), denotes those in reference to whom, or connection with whom, this moving onwards took place, so that consequently &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; includes within itself, together with the subjective notion, the transitive notion of &#1488;&#1491;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, for the singer of the Psalm is a Levite; as an example in support of this &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-27.htm">2 Chronicles 20:27</a>., cf. v. 21. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1495;&#1493;&#1490;&#1490; is the apposition to the personal suffix of this &#1488;&#1491;&#1491;&#1501;: with them, a multitude keeping holy-day. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a> the poet seeks to solace and encourage himself at this contrast of the present with the past: Why art thou thus cast down... (lxx &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;, &#x3ba;. &#x3c4;. &#x3bb;., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>). It is the spirit which, as the stronger and more valiant part of the man, speaks to the soul as to the &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; the spiritual man soothes the natural man.

Although it is, however, a custom with the psalmists and prophets not to express such refrainlike thoughts in exactly the same form and words (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-9.htm">Psalm 24:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13</a>, 21; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-5.htm">Psalm 56:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-11.htm">Psalm 56:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>, 18), nevertheless it is to be read here by a change in the division both of the words and the verses, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/43-5.htm">Psalm 43:5</a>, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, as is done by the lxx (Cod. Alex.), Syriac, Vulgate, and most modern expositors. For the words &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, though in themselves a good enough sense (vid., e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-9.htm">Isaiah 64:9</a>), produce no proper closing cadence, and are not sufficient to form a line of a verse.<p>(Note: Even an old Hebrew MS directs attention to the erroneousness of the Soph pasuk here; vid., Pinsker, Einleitung, S. 133 l.) </body></html>
