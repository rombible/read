The way to keep the heart quiet, is to keep ourselves in the love of God. But a sense of guilt is too heavy to bear; and would sink men into despair and ruin, unless removed by the pardoning mercy of God. If there were not sin in our souls, there would be no pain in our bones, no illness in our bodies. The guilt of sin is a burden to the whole creation, which groans under it. It will be a burden to the sinners themselves, when they are heavy-laden under it, or a burden of ruin, when it sinks them to hell. When we perceive our true condition, the Good Physician will be valued, sought, and obeyed. Yet many let their wounds rankle, because they delay to go to their merciful Friend. When, at any time, we are distempered in our bodies, we ought to remember how God has been dishonoured in and by our bodies. The groanings which cannot be uttered, are not hid from Him that searches the heart, and knows the mind of the Spirit. David, in his troubles, was a type of Christ in his agonies, of Christ on his cross, suffering and deserted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thine arrows slick fast in me - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>. The word rendered "stick fast" - &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;  na&#770;chath - means properly to go or come down; to descend; and the literal idea here would be, "thine arrows come down upon me." It is not so much the idea of their "sticking fast" when in the wound or flesh; it is that they come down upon one, and pierce him. The meaning is, that he was afflicted "as if" God had wounded him with arrows - arrows which pierced deep in his flesh. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>. The allusion is to the disease with which he was afflicted.<p>And thy hand presseth me sore - The same word is used here which in the former part of the verse is rendered "stick fast." The idea is, that the hand of God had "descended" or "come down" upon him, prostrating his strength, and laying him on a bed of pain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. arrows &#8230; and thy hand&#8212;the sharp and heavy afflictions he suffered (De 32:23).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/38.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.<p>3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.<p>4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden are they too heavy for me.<p>5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.<p>6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.<p>7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.<p>8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a><p>"For thine arrows stick fat in me." By this he means both bodily and spiritual griefs, but we may suppose, especially the latter, for these are most piercing and stick the fastest. God's law applied by the Spirit to the conviction of the soul of sin, wounds deeply and rankles long; it is an arrow not lightly to be brushed out by careless mirthfulness, or to be extracted by the flattering hand of self-righteousness. The Lord knows how to shoot so that his bolts not only strike but stick. He can make convictions sink into the innermost spirit like arrows driven in up to the head. It seems strange that the Lord should shoot at his own beloved ones, but in truth he shoots at their sins rather than them, and those who feel his sin-killing shafts in this life, shall not be slain with his hot thunderbolts in the next world. "And thy hand presseth me sore." The Lord had come to close dealing with him, and pressed him down with the weight of his hand, so that he had no rest or strength left. By these two expressions we are taught that conviction of sin is a piercing and a pressing thing, sharp and sore, smarting and crushing. Those who know by experience "the terrors of the Lord," will be best able to vouch for the accuracy of such descriptions; they are true to the life.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3</a><p>"There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger." Mental depression tells upon the bodily frame; it is enough to create and foster every disease, and is in itself the most painful of all diseases. Soul sickness tells upon the entire frame; it weakens the body, and then bodily weakness reacts upon the mind. One drop of divine anger sets the whole of our blood boiling with misery. "Neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin." Deeper still the malady penetrates, 'till the bones, the more solid parts of the system, are affected. No soundness and no rest are two sad deficiencies; yet these are both consciously gone from every awakened conscience until Jesus gives relief. God's anger is a fire that dries up the very marrow; it searches the secret parts of the belly. A man who has pain in his bones tosses to and fro in search of rest, but he finds none; he becomes worn out with agony, and so in many cases a sense of sin creates in the conscience a horrible unrest which cannot be exceeded in anguish except by hell itself.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a><p>"For mine iniquities are gone over mine head." Like waves of the deep sea; like black mire in which a man utterly sinks. Above my hopes, my strength, and my life itself, my sin rises in its terror. Unawakened sinners think their sins to be mere shallows, but when conscience is aroused they find out the depth of iniquity. "As an heavy burden they are too heavy for me." It is well when sin is an intolerable load, and when the remembrance of our sins burdens us beyond endurance. This verse is the genuine cry of one who feels himself undone by his transgressions and as yet sees not the great sacrifice.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thine arrows, </span> i.e. thy judgments inflicted upon my outward and inward man, oft compared to arrows, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-23.htm" title="I will heap mischiefs on them; I will spend my arrows on them.">Deu 32:23</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm" title="He has also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordains his arrows against the persecutors.">Psalm 7:13</a> 45:5 91:5</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Presseth me sore; </span> or, <span class="ital">comes down upon me</span>; as when a strong man lifts up his hand and weapon, that it may fall down with greater violence, and make the deeper wound. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thine arrows stick fast in me,....

This is by some supposed to be some bodily disease inflicted on him; some have thought of the leprosy, which was a stroke from the hand of God; but this is not likely, since he must have been deposed and shut up; the Jews indeed say (e) that he was a leper six months, and that the divine Presence was taken from him; a late learned man (f) thinks it was the smallpox, from the unsoundness of his flesh, the soreness of the disease, the stench of it, temporary blindness, and his friends standing aloof from him; though perhaps no other than affliction of mired for sin, comparable to the disease described, is meant. <p>(e) In R.
