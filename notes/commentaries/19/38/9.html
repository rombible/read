The way to keep the heart quiet, is to keep ourselves in the love of God. But a sense of guilt is too heavy to bear; and would sink men into despair and ruin, unless removed by the pardoning mercy of God. If there were not sin in our souls, there would be no pain in our bones, no illness in our bodies. The guilt of sin is a burden to the whole creation, which groans under it. It will be a burden to the sinners themselves, when they are heavy-laden under it, or a burden of ruin, when it sinks them to hell. When we perceive our true condition, the Good Physician will be valued, sought, and obeyed. Yet many let their wounds rankle, because they delay to go to their merciful Friend. When, at any time, we are distempered in our bodies, we ought to remember how God has been dishonoured in and by our bodies. The groanings which cannot be uttered, are not hid from Him that searches the heart, and knows the mind of the Spirit. David, in his troubles, was a type of Christ in his agonies, of Christ on his cross, suffering and deserted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lord, all my desire is before thee - That is, Thou knowest all that I would ask or that I need. This is the expression of one who felt that his only hope was in God, and that He fully understood the case. There was no need of repeating the request. He was willing to leave the whole case with God.<p>And my groaning is not hid from thee - My sighing; the expression of my sorrow and anguish. As God certainly heard these sighs, and as He wholly understood the case, David hoped that He would mercifully interpose in his behalf. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

If unuttered, yet perceived. Blessed be God, he reads the longings of our hearts; nothing can be hidden from him; what we cannot tell to him he perfectly understands. The Psalmist is conscious that he has not exaggerated, and therefore appeals to heaven for a confirmation of his words. The good Physician understands the symptoms of our disease and sees the hidden evil which they reveal, hence our case is safe in his hands. "And my groaning is not hid from thee."<p>"He takes the meaning of our tears,<p>The language of our groans."<p>Sorrow and anguish hide themselves from the observation of man, but God spieth them out. None more lonely than the broken-hearted sinner, yet hath he the Lord for his companion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I do not utter all these complaints, nor roar out, that thou mayst hear and know them, for thou hearest and knowest even my lowest groans; yea, mine inward desires, and all my necessities.

To be delivered from his afflictions, to have a discovery and application of pardoning grace, and to have communion with his God: the desire of his soul was unto these things; and it was some satisfaction to him that it was before the Lord, and known unto him, before whom all things are naked and open; <p>and my groaning is not hid from thee; under the weight of his affliction, the burden of his sin, and which he expressed in prayer to the Lord, and which is often done with groanings which cannot be uttered: but even these are known and understood by the Lord. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>.

Of these the  most tangible are the pain caused by the desertion of his "lovers," "friends," and "kinsmen" (ver. 11), and the alarm arising from the action taken, simultaneously, by his ill wishers and adversaries (ver. 12). These afflictions have reduced him to a condition of silence - almost of apathy, such as is described in vers. 13, 14. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</span> This has been called "the first indication of hope in this psalm;" but there is a gleam of hope in the prayer of ver. 1. Hope, however, does here show itself more plainly than before. The psalmist has laid "all his desire" before God, and feels that God is weighing and considering it. He has also opened to him "all his groanings" - uttered freely all his complaint. This he could have been led to do only from a conviction that God was not irrevocably offended with him, but might, by repentance, confession, and earnest striving after amendment (ver. 20), be reconciled, and induced to become his Defence (ver. 15) and his Salvation (ver. 22). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 38:2-9) David begins, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-1.htm">Psalm 6:1-10</a>, with the prayer that his punitive affliction may be changed into disciplinary. Bakius correctly paraphrases. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a> : Corripe sane per legem, castiga per crucem, millies promerui, negare non possum, sed castiga, quaeso, me ex amore ut pater, non ex furore et fervore ut judex; ne punias justitiae rigore, sed misericordiae dulcore (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>). The negative is to be repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>. In the description, which give the ground of the cry for pity, &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, is not the Piel, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>, but the Niphal of the Kal &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; immediately following (root &#1504;&#1495;). &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; is anger as a breaking forth, fragor (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>, lxx &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), with e&#774; instead of &#305;&#774; in the first syllable, vowels which alternate in this word; and &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, as a glowing or burning. &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (in Homer, &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;), God's wrath-arrows, i.e., lightnings of wrath, are His judgments of wrath; and &#1497;&#1491;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>, God's punishing hand, which makes itself felt in dispensing punishment, hence &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; might be attached as a mood of sequence. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a> wrath is called &#1494;&#1506;&#1501; as a boiling up. Sin is the cause of this experiencing wrath, and the wrath is the cause of the bodily derangement; sin as an exciting cause of the wrath always manifests itself outwardly even on the body as a fatal power. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a> sin is compared to waters that threaten to drown one, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a> to a burden that presses one down. &#1499;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, they are heavier than I, i.e., than my power of endurance, too heavy for me. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-6.htm">Psalm 38:6</a> the effects of the operation of the divine hand (as punishing) are wounds, &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; (properly, suffused variegated marks from a blow or wheals, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>; from &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;, Arab. h&#803;br, to be or make striped, variegated), which &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, send forth an offensive smell, and &#1504;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, suppurate. Sin, which causes this, is called &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, because, as it is at last manifest, it is always the destruction of itself. With emphasis does &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; form the second half of the verse. To take &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a> and put it to this, as Meier and Thenius propose, is to destroy this its proper position. On the three &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, vid., Ewald, 217, l. Thus sick in soul and body, he is obliged to bow and bend himself in the extreme. &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492; is used of a convulsive drawing together of the body, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1495;, of a bowed mien, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>; &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, of a heavy, lagging gait. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-8.htm">Psalm 38:8</a> the grounding of the petition begins for the third time. His &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., internal muscles of the loins, which are usually the fattest parts, are full of &#1504;&#1511;&#1500;&#1492;, that which is burnt, i.e., parched. It is therefore as though the burning, starting from the central point of the bodily power, would spread itself over the whole body: the wrath of God works commotion in this latter as well as in the soul. Whilst all the energies of life thus yield, there comes over him a partial, almost total lifelessness. &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490; is the proper word for the coldness and rigidity of a corpse; the Niphal means to be brought into this condition, just as &#1504;&#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; means to be crushed, or to be brought into a condition of crushing, i.e., of violent dissolution. The &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1514; is intended to imply that the loud wail is only the utterance of the pain that is raging in his heart, the outward expression of his ceaseless, deep inward groaning. </body></html>
