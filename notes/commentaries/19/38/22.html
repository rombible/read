David, in the complaints he makes of his enemies, seems to refer to Christ. But our enemies do us real mischief only when they drive us from God and our duty. The true believer's trouble will be made useful; he will learn to wait for his God, and will not seek relief from the world or himself. The less we notice the unkindness and injuries that are done us, the more we consult the quiet of our own minds. David's troubles were the chastisement and the consequence of his transgressions, whilst Christ suffered for our sins and ours only. What right can a sinner have to yield to impatience or anger, when mercifully corrected for his sins? David was very sensible of the present workings of corruption in him. Good men, by setting their sorrow continually before them, have been ready to fall; but by setting God always before them, they have kept their standing. If we are truly penitent for sin, that will make us patient under affliction. Nothing goes nearer to the heart of a believer when in affliction, than to be under the apprehension of God's deserting him; nor does any thing come more feelingly from his heart than this prayer, Be not far from me. The Lord will hasten to help those who trust in him as their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make haste to help me - Margin, as in Hebrew: "for my help." This is an earnest prayer that God would come immediately to his rescue.<p>O Lord my salvation - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>. The effect, therefore, of the trials that came upon the psalmist was to lead him to cry most earnestly to God. Those sorrows led him to God. This is one of the designed effects of affliction. Trouble never accomplishes its proper effect unless it leads us to God; and anything that "will" lead us to him is a gain in the end. The deeper our trouble, therefore, the greater may be the ultimate good to us; and at the end of life, when we come to look over all that has happened in our journey through this world, that on which we may look back with most satisfaction and gratitude may be the sorrows and afflictions that have befallen us - for these will be then seen to have been among the chief instrumentalities by which we were weaned from sin; by which we were led to the Saviour; by which we were induced to seek a preparation for heaven. No Christian, when he comes to die, ever feels that he has been too much afflicted, or that any trial has come upon him for which there was not occasion, and which was not designed and adapted to do him good. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21, 22. (Compare Ps 22:19; 35:3). All terms of frequent use. In this Psalm the language is generally susceptible of application to Christ as a sufferer, David, as such, typifying Him. This does not require us to apply the confessions of sin, but only the pains or penalties which He bore for us.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Make haste and help me,.... Or, "for my help"; his case required haste, and God does help his people when none else can, and that right early; <p>O Lord, my salvation; by which it appears that his prayer was a prayer of faith; he saw that his salvation was in the Lord, and in no other; and though he had been and was in such a low condition, both in soul and body, yet his faith was not lost; that is an abiding grace, and will continue under the influence of the author and finisher of it, until the end of it is received, the salvation of the soul.

He waits for His answer, for (&#1499;&#1497;) he says, etc. - he waits for an answer, for the hearing of this his petition which is directed towards the glory of God, that God would not suffer his foes to triumph over him, nor strengthen them in their mercilessness and injustice. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a> appears also to stand under the government of the &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;;<p>(Note: The following are the constructions of &#1508;&#1503; when a clause of ore than one member follows it: (1) fut. and perf., the latter with the tone of the perf. consec., e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>., or without it, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a> (which see); (2) fut. and fut. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-46.htm">Jeremiah 51:46</a>. This construction is indispensable where it is intended to give special prominence to the subject notion or a secondary notion of the clause, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Deuteronomy 20:6</a>. In one instance &#1508;&#1503; is even followed (3) by the perf. and fut. consec., viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a>.)<p>but, since in this case one would look for a Waw relat. and a different order of the words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a> is to be regarded as a subject clause: "who, when my foot totters, i.e., when my affliction changes to entire downfall, would magnify themselves against me." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>,   &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; connects what follows with &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1496; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; by way of confirmation: he is &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; &#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1506;, ready for falling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>), he will, if God does not graciously interpose, assuredly fall headlong. The fourth &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-19.htm">Psalm 38:19</a> is attached confirmatorily to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>: his intense pain or sorrow is ever present to him, for he is obliged to confess his guilt, and this feeling of guilt is just the very sting of his pain. And whilst he in the consciousness of well-deserved punishment is sick unto death, his foes are numerous and withal vigorous and full of life. Instead of &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, probably &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-5.htm">Psalm 69:5</a>, is to be read (Houbigant, Hitzig, Kster, Hupfeld, Ewald, and Olshausen). But even the lxx read &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;; and the reading which is so old, although it does not very well suit &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (instead of which one would look for &#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), is still not without meaning: he looks upon himself, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-9.htm">Psalm 38:9</a>, more as one dead than living; his foes, however, are &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, living, i.e., vigorous. The verb frequently ash this pregnant meaning, and the adjective can also have it. Just as the accentuation of the form &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; varies elsewhere out of pause, &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; here has the tone on the ultima, although it is not perf. consec.<p>(Note: As perf. consec. the following have the accent on the ultima: - &#1493;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9</a>, and &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>; perhaps also &#1493;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1493;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, and &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (perf. hypoth.), <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-15.htm">Job 32:15</a>.

Instead of &#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497; (Ges. 61, rem. 2) the Ker is &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1497;, ra&#772;dephi&#770;  (without any Makkeph following), or &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1497;, ra&#772;dophi&#770;; cf. on this pronunciation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a>, and with the Chethb &#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;, the Chethb &#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1508;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a>, also &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>. By the "following of that which is good" David means more particularly that which is brought into exercise in relation to his present foes.<p>(Note: In the Greek and Latin texts, likewise in all the Aethiopic and several Arabic texts, and in the Syriac Psalterium Medilanense, the following addition is found after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-21.htm">Psalm 38:21</a> : Ce aperripsan me ton agapeton osi necron ebdelygmenon, Et projecerunt me dilectum tanquam mortuum abominatum (so the Psalt. Veronense). Theodoret refers it to Absalom's relation to David. The words &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>.)<p>He closes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a> with sighs for help. No lighting up of the darkness of wrath takes place. The fides supplex is not changed into fides triumphans. But the closing words, "O Lord, my salvation" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>), show where the repentance of Cain and that of David differ. True repentance has faith within itself, it despairs of itself, but not of God. </body></html>
