The way to keep the heart quiet, is to keep ourselves in the love of God. But a sense of guilt is too heavy to bear; and would sink men into despair and ruin, unless removed by the pardoning mercy of God. If there were not sin in our souls, there would be no pain in our bones, no illness in our bodies. The guilt of sin is a burden to the whole creation, which groans under it. It will be a burden to the sinners themselves, when they are heavy-laden under it, or a burden of ruin, when it sinks them to hell. When we perceive our true condition, the Good Physician will be valued, sought, and obeyed. Yet many let their wounds rankle, because they delay to go to their merciful Friend. When, at any time, we are distempered in our bodies, we ought to remember how God has been dishonoured in and by our bodies. The groanings which cannot be uttered, are not hid from Him that searches the heart, and knows the mind of the Spirit. David, in his troubles, was a type of Christ in his agonies, of Christ on his cross, suffering and deserted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-1.htm">Psalm 6:1</a>, where the same language occurs, except in the change of a single Hebrew "word," that is, "wrath," though expressing the same idea.<p>Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-1.htm">Psalm 6:1</a>. The Hebrew in both is the same, except that in this place the negative particle is omitted, but without affecting the sense. It is not improbable that the one was copied from the other, or that this was composed with the language of the former in the memory. Thus we often use language with which we are familiar, as being well adapted to express our ideas. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 38<p>Ps 38:1-22. To bring to remembrance, or, remind God of His mercy and himself of his sin. Appealing to God for relief from His heavy chastisement, the Psalmist avows his integrity before men, complains of the defection of friends and persecution of enemies, and in a submissive spirit, casting himself on God, with penitent confession he pleads God's covenant relation and his innocence of the charges of his enemies, and prays for divine comfort and help.<p>1-4. He deprecates deserved punishment, which is described (Ps 6:1), under the figure of bodily disease [Ps 38:3].<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/38.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath; neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.<p>"O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath." Rebuked I must be, for I am an erring child and thou a careful Father, but throw not too much anger into the tones of thy voice; deal gently although I have sinned grievously. The anger of others I can bear, but not thine. As thy love is most sweet to my heart, so thy displeasure is most cutting to my conscience. "Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure." Chasten me if thou wilt, it is a Father's prerogative, and to endure it obediently is a child's duty; but, O turn not the rod into a sword, smite not so as to kill. True, my sins might well inflame thee, but let thy mercy and long-suffering quench the glowing coals of thy wrath. O let me not be treated as an enemy or dealt with as a rebel. Bring to remembrance thy covenant, thy fatherhood, and my feebleness, and spare thy servant. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is reckoned one of David’s penitential Psalms. It was composed upon occasion of some sore disease, or grievous calamity; which he rightly judged to be inflicted upon him for his sins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. To God, that by this humble and mournful prayer he might prevail with God to remember and pity him; for now he seemed quite to have forgotten him. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. To himself, that by reviewing this Psalm afterwards he might call to mind his former danger and misery, and God’s wonderful mercy in delivering him from them; which we are very apt to forget; and that others also might remember and consider what God had done to him, first in chastening, and then in restoring him, and might make use of his example for their benefit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>David, being visited with sickness, rehearseth his woeful condition, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/38-1.htm" title="O lord, rebuke me not in your wrath: neither chasten me in your hot displeasure....">Psalm 38:1-3</a></span>, by reason of his sins, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/38-4.htm" title="For my iniquities are gone over my head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me....">Psalm 38:4-8</a></span>; prayeth for forgiveness, help, and favour, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-9.htm" title="Lord, all my desire is before you; and my groaning is not hid from you.">Psalm 38:9</a>,10</span>.
