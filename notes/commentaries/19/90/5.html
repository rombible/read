The verb, <span class= "ital">carries away with its floods </span>is found only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-17.htm" title="The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: your arrows also went abroad.">Psalm 77:17</a> (“the clouds poured out water”), but the cognate noun is frequent for a heavy rainfall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-6.htm" title="And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.">Isaiah 4:6</a>, &c.), such as in the East in a few moments causes a flood. This interpretation is partly supported by the LXX. and Vulg.: “Their years shall be nothingness;” and many commentators have felt that the image of the “stream of time” was required here.

In the morning of youth, fair and beautiful, man groweth up and flourisheth; in the evening of age (and how often before that evening!) he is cut down by the stroke of death; all his juices, to the circulation of which he stood indebted for life, health, and strength, are dried up; he withereth, and turneth again to his earth.” — Horne.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/90.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>90:1-6 It is supposed that this psalm refers to the sentence passed on Israel in the wilderness, Nu 14. The favour and protection of God are the only sure rest and comfort of the soul in this evil world. Christ Jesus is the refuge and dwelling-place to which we may repair. We are dying creatures, all our comforts in the world are dying comforts, but God is an ever-living God, and believers find him so. When God, by sickness, or other afflictions, turns men to destruction, he thereby calls men to return unto him to repent of their sins, and live a new life. A thousand years are nothing to God's eternity: between a minute and a million of years there is some proportion; between time and eternity there is none. All the events of a thousand years, whether past or to come, are more present to the Eternal Mind, than what was done in the last hour is to us. And in the resurrection, the body and soul shall both return and be united again. Time passes unobserved by us, as with men asleep; and when it is past, it is as nothing. It is a short and quickly-passing life, as the waters of a flood. Man does but flourish as the grass, which, when the winter of old age comes, will wither; but he may be mown down by disease or disaster.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/90.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou carriest them away as with a flood - The original here is a single verb with the suffix - &#1494;&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1501;  zerameta&#770;m. The verb - &#1494;&#1512;&#1501;  za&#770;ram - means, to flow, to pour; then, to pour upon, to overwhelm, to wash away. The idea is, that they were swept off as if a torrent bore them from the earth, carrying them away without regard to order, rank, age, or condition. So death makes no discrimination. Every day that passes, multitudes of every age, sex, condition, rank, are swept away and consigned to the grave - as they would be if a raging flood should sweep over a land.<p>They are as a sleep - The original here is, "a sleep they are." The whole sentence is exceedingly graphic and abrupt: "Thou sweepest them away; a sleep they are - in the morning - like grass - it passes away." The idea is that human life resembles a sleep, because it seems to pass so swiftly; to accomplish so little; to be so filled with dreams and visions, none of which remain or become permanent.<p>In the morning they are like grass which groweth up - A better translation of this would be to attach the words "in the morning to the previous member of the sentence, "They are like sleep in the morning;" that is, They are as sleep appears to us in the morning, when we wake from it - rapid, unreal, full of empty dreams. The other part of the sentence then would be, "Like grass, it passeth away." The word rendered "groweth up," is in the margin translated "is changed." The Hebrew word - &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;  cha&#770;laph - means to pass, to pass along, to pass by; to pass on, to come on; also, to revive or flourish as a plant; and then, to change. It may be rendered here, "pass away;" and the idea then would be that they are like grass in the fields, or like flowers, which soon "change" by passing away. There is nothing more permanent in man than there is in the grass or in the flowers of the field. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/90.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

As the whole world of the ungodly were with the deluge, to which perhaps the allusion is; the phrase is expressive of death; so the Targum, <p>"if they are not converted, thou wilt bring death upon them;'' <p>the swiftness of time is aptly signified by the flowing gliding stream of a flood, by the rolling billows and waves of it; so one hour, one day, one month, one year, roll on after another: moreover, the suddenness of death may be here intended, which comes in an hour unlooked for, and unaware of, as a flood comes suddenly, occasioned by hasty showers of rain; as also the irresistible force and power of it, which none can withstand; of which the rapidity of a flood is a lively emblem, and which carries all before it, and sweeps away everything that stands in its course; as death, by an epidemic and infectious disease, or in a battle, carries off thousands and ten thousands in a very little time; nor does it spare any, as a flood does not, of any age or sex, of any rank or condition of life; and, like a flood, makes sad destruction and devastation where it comes, and especially where it takes off great numbers; it not only turns beauty to ashes, and strength into weakness and corruption, but depopulates towns, and cities, and kingdoms; and as the flowing flood and gliding stream can never be fetched back again, so neither can life when past, not one moment of time when gone; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a>, besides this phrase may denote the turbulent and tempestuous manner in which, sometimes, wicked men go out of the world, a storm being within and without, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20</a>, "they are as a sleep"; or dream, which soon passeth away; in a sound sleep, time is insensibly gone; and a dream, before it can be well known what it is, is over and lost in oblivion; and so short is human life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-8.htm">Job 20:8</a> there may be, sometimes, a seeming pleasure enjoyed, as in dreams, but no satisfaction; as a man in sleep may dream that he is eating and drinking, and please himself with it; but, when he awakes, he is hungry and empty, and unsatisfied; and so is man with everything in this life, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>, and all things in life are a mere dream, as the honours, riches, and pleasures of it; a man rather dreams of honour, substance, and pleasure, than really enjoys them. Wicked men, while they live, are "as those that sleep"; as the Targum renders it; they have no spiritual senses, cannot see, hear, smell, taste, nor feel; they are without strength to everything that is spiritually good; inactive, and do none; are subject to illusions and mistakes; are in imminent danger, and unconcerned about it; and do not care to be jogged or awaked, and sleep on till they sleep the sleep of death, unless awaked by powerful and efficacious grace; and men when dead are asleep, not in their souls, but in their bodies; death is often in Scripture signified by a sleep, under which men continue until the resurrection, which is an awaking out of it: <p>in the morning they are like grass, which groweth up or "passeth away", or "changeth" (d); or is changed; some understand this of the morning of the resurrection, when there will be a change for the better, a renovation, as Kimchi interprets the word; and which, from the use of it in the Arabic language, as Schultens observes (e), signifies to be green and flourishing, as grass in the morning is; and so intends a recovery of rigour and strength, as a man after sleep, and as the saints will have when raised from the dead. The Targum refers it to the world to come, <p>"and in the world to come, as grass is cut down, they shall be changed or renewed;'' <p>but it is rather to be understood of the flourishing of men in the morning of youth, as the next verse shows, where it is repeated, and where the change of grass is beautifully illustrated and explained. <p>(d) "quae mutatur", Pagninus; "mutabitur", Montanus; "immutatur", Tigurine version; "transiens", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "quae transit", Musculus, Gejerus, Michaelis.

Its significance depends on the peculiar character of some of the grasses in Palestine. “The grasses of the Jordan valley and the Dead Sea basin are very peculiar, seldom becoming turf-like, or compact in growth, shooting up in early spring with the greatest luxuriance, and then as rapidly seeding and dying down, scorched and burnt up at once, and leaving for the rest of the year no other trace of their existence than the straggling stems from which the seeds and their sheath have long been shaken.” Tristram, <span class="ital">Nat.

In this passage it must have a sense akin to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;. It is impossible on syntactic grounds to regard &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; as still dependent upon &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; (Ewald) or, as Hupfeld is fond of calling it, as a "post-liminiar" genitive. Can it be that the &#1499;&#1500; is perhaps a mutilation of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-15.htm">Ezekiel 36:15</a>, as Bttcher suggests? We do not need this conjecture. For (1) to carry any one in one's bosom, if he is an enemy, may signify: to be obliged to cherish him with the vexation proceeding from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>), without being able to get rid of him; (2) there is no doubt that &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; can, after the manner of numerals, be placed before the substantive to which it belongs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-10.htm">Ezekiel 32:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-29.htm">Proverbs 31:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-28.htm">Nehemiah 9:28</a>; cf. the other position, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>; (3) consequently &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; may signify the "totality of many peoples" just as well as &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a>. The poet complains as a member of the nation, as a citizen of the empire, that he is obliged to foster many nations in his bosom, inasmuch as the land of Israel was overwhelmed by the Egyptians and their allies, the Libyans, Troglodytes, and Ethiopians. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a> cannot now be referred back over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a> to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; (qua&#770; calumnia&#770;), and yet the relative sense, not the confirmatory (because, quoniam), is at issue. We therefore refer it to &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, and take &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; as an apposition, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-20.htm">Psalm 139:20</a> : who reproach Thee, (as) Thine enemies, Jahve, who reproach the footsteps (&#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a> with Dag. dirimens, which gives it an emotional turn) of Thine anointed, i.e., they follow him everywhere, wheresoever he may go, and whatsoever he may do. With these significant words, &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498;, the Third Book of the Psalms dies away. </body></html>
