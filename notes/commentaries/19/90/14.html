They pray for the mercy of God, for they pretend not to plead any merit of their own. His favour would be a full fountain of future joys. It would be a sufficient balance to former griefs. Let the grace of God in us produce the light of good works. And let Divine consolations put gladness into our hearts, and a lustre upon our countenances. The work of our hands, establish thou it; and, in order to that, establish us in it. Instead of wasting our precious, fleeting days in pursuing fancies, which leave the possessors for ever poor, let us seek the forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance in heaven. Let us pray that the work of the Holy Spirit may appear in converting our hearts, and that the beauty of holiness may be seen in our conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/90.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O satisfy us early with thy mercy - literally, "In the morning;" as soon as the day dawns.

Or "grace" (g); the means of grace, the God of all grace, and communion with him, Christ and his grace; things without which, souls hungry and thirsty, in a spiritual sense, cannot be satisfied; these will satisfy them, and nothing else; namely, the discoveries of the love of God, his pardoning grace and mercy, Christ and his righteousness, and the fulness of grace in him; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>, this grace and mercy they desire to be satisfied and filled with betimes, early, seasonably, as soon as could be, or it was fitting it should: it may be rendered "in the morning" (h), which some understand literally of the beginning of the day, and so lay a foundation for joy the whole day following: some interpret it of the morning of the resurrection; with which compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a> others of the day of redemption and salvation, as Kimchi and Jarchi: it may well enough be applied to the morning of the Gospel dispensation; and Christ himself, who is "the mercy promised" unto the fathers, may be meant; "whose coming was prepared as the morning"; and satisfied such as were hungry and thirsty, weary and faint, with looking for it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a> The Targum is, <p>"satisfy us with thy goodness in the world, which is like to the morning;'' <p>and Arama interprets it of the time of the resurrection of the dead. <p>that we may rejoice and be glad all our days; the love, grace, and mercy of God, his presence, and communion with him, the coming of Christ, and the blessings of grace by him, lay a solid foundation for lasting joy in the Lord's people, who have reason always to rejoice in him; and their joy is such that no man can take from them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>. <p>(g) "gratia tua", Cocceius, Gejerus, Michaelis.

The suffix of &#1494;&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, referred to the thousand years, produces a synallage (since &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; is feminine), which is to be avoided whenever it is possible to do so; the reference to &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, as being the principal object pointed to in what has gone before, is the more natural, to say the very least. In connection with both ways of applying it, &#1494;&#1512;&#1501; does not signify: to cause to rattle down like sudden heavy showers of rain; for the figure that God makes years, or that He makes men (Hitzig: the germs of their coming into being), to rain down from above, is fanciful and strange. &#1494;&#1512;&#1501; may also mean to sweep or wash away as with heavy rains, abripere instar nimbi, as the old expositors take it. So too Luther at one time: Du reyssest sie dahyn (Thou carriest them away), for which he substituted later: Du lessest sie dahin faren wie einen Strom (Thou causest them to pass away as a river); but &#1494;&#1512;&#1501; always signifies rain pouring down from above. As a sudden and heavy shower of rain, becoming a flood, washes everything away, so God's omnipotence sweeps men away. There is now no transition to another alien figure when the poet continues: &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;. What is meant is the sleep of death, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-39.htm">Jeremiah 51:39</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-57.htm">Jeremiah 51:57</a>, cf. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-4.htm">Psalm 13:4</a>. He whom a flood carries away is actually brought into a state of unconsciousness, he goes entirely to sleep, i.e., he dies.<p>From this point the poet certainly does pass on to another figure. The one generation is carried away as by a flood in the night season, and in the morning another grows up. Men are the subject of &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, as of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;. The collective singular alternates with the plural, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-3.htm">Psalm 90:3</a> the collective &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; alternates with &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;. The two members of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a> stand in contrast. The poet describes the succession of the generations. One generation perishes as it were in a flood, and another grows up, and this also passes on to the same fate. The meaning in both verses of the &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, which has been for the most part, after the lxx, Vulgate, and Luther, erroneously taken to be praeterire  equals  interire, is determined in accordance with this idea. The general signification of this verb, which corresponds to the Arabic chlf, is "to follow or move after, to go into the place of another, and in general, of passing over from one place or state into another." Accordingly the Hiphil signifies to put into a new condition, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>, to set a new thing on the place of an old one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-9.htm">Isaiah 9:9</a> [10], to gain new strength, to take fresh courage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>; and of plants: to send forth new shoots, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7</a>; consequently the Kal, which frequently furnishes the perfect for the future Hiphil (Ew. 127, b, and Hitzig on this passage), of plants signifies: to gain new shoots, not: to sprout (Targum, Syriac), but to sprout again or afresh, regerminare; cf. Arab. chilf, an aftergrowth, new wood. Perishing humanity renews its youth in ever new generations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a> again takes up this thought: in the morning it grows up and shoots afresh, viz., the grass to which men are likened (a figure appropriated by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>), in the evening it is cut down and it dries up. Others translate &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; to wither (root &#1502;&#1500;, properly to be long and lax, to allow to hang down long, cf. &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, &#1488;&#1502;&#1500; with Arab. 'ml, to hope, i.e., to look forth into the distance); but (1) this Pilel of &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; or Poe&#772;l of &#1502;&#1500;&#1500; is not favourable to this intransitive way of taking it; (2) the reflexive in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a> proves that &#1502;&#1500;&#1500; signifies to cut off in the front or above, after which perhaps even <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>, by comparison with <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a>, are to be explained. In the last passage it runs: as the top of the stalk they are cut off (fut. Niph. of &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;). Such a cut or plucked ear of corn is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-25.htm">Deuteronomy 23:25</a> &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, a Deuteronomic hapaxlegomenon which favours our way of taking the &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; (with a most general subject  equals  &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;). Thus, too, &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; is better attached to what precedes: the cut grass becomes parched hay. Just such an alternation of morning springing froth and evening drying up is the alternation of the generations of men.<p>The poet substantiates this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-7.htm">Psalm 90:7</a>. from the experience of those amongst whom he comprehended himself in the &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>, Hengstenberg takes <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-7.htm">Psalm 90:7</a> to be a statement of the cause of the transitoriness set forth: its cause is the wrath of God; but the poet does not begin &#1499;&#1497; &#1489;&#1488;&#1508;&#1498; but &#1499;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;. The chief emphasis therefore lies upon the perishing, and &#1499;&#1497; is not argumentative but explicative. If the subject of &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; were men in general (Olshausen), then it would be elucidating idem per idem. But, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>, those who speak here are those whose refuge the Eternal One is. The poet therefore speaks in the name of the church, and confirms the lot of men from that which his people have experienced even down to the present time. Israel is able out of its own experience to corroborate what all men pass through; it has to pass through the very same experience as a special decree of God's wrath on account of its sins. Therefore in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-7.htm">Psalm 90:7-8</a> we stand altogether upon historical ground. The testimony of the inscription is here verified in the contents of the Psalm. The older generation that came out of Egypt fell a prey to the sentence of punishment, that they should gradually die off during the forty years' journey through the desert; and even Moses and Aaron, Joshua and Caleb only excepted, were included in this punishment on special grounds, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-34.htm">Deuteronomy 1:34-39</a>. This it is over which Moses here laments. God's wrath is here called &#1488;&#1507; and &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;; just as the Book of Deuteronomy (in distinction from the other books of the Pentateuch) is fond of combining these two synonyms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-19.htm">Deuteronomy 9:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-44.htm">Genesis 27:44</a>.). The breaking forth of the infinitely great opposition of the holy nature of God against sin has swept away the church in the person of its members, even down to the present moment; &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>, cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>. It is the consequence of their sins. &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; signifies sin as the perversion of the right standing and conduct; &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, that which is veiled in distinction from manifest sins, is the sum-total of hidden moral, and that sinful, conduct. There is no necessity to regard &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; as a defective plural; &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; signifies youth (from a radically distinct word, &#1506;&#1500;&#1501;); secret sins would therefore be called &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a>. God sets transgressions before Him when, because the measure is full and forgiveness is inadmissible, He makes them an object of punishment. &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468; (Ker, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-7.htm">Psalm 8:7</a> : &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-4.htm">Psalm 6:4</a> &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-6.htm">Psalm 74:6</a> &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;) has the accent upon the ultima before an initial guttural. The parallel to &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; is &#1500;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;. &#1506;&#1493;&#1512; is light, and &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; is either a body of light, as the sun and moon, or, as in this passage, the circle of light which the light forms. The countenance of God (&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;) is God's nature in its inclination towards the world, and &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492; is the doxa of His nature that is turned towards the world, which penetrates everything that is conformed to God as a gracious light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>), and makes manifest to the bottom everything that is opposed to God and consumes it as a wrathful fire. </body></html>
