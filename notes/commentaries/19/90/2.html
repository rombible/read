The favour and protection of God are the only sure rest and comfort of the soul in this evil world. Christ Jesus is the refuge and dwelling-place to which we may repair. We are dying creatures, all our comforts in the world are dying comforts, but God is an ever-living God, and believers find him so. When God, by sickness, or other afflictions, turns men to destruction, he thereby calls men to return unto him to repent of their sins, and live a new life. A thousand years are nothing to God's eternity: between a minute and a million of years there is some proportion; between time and eternity there is none. All the events of a thousand years, whether past or to come, are more present to the Eternal Mind, than what was done in the last hour is to us. And in the resurrection, the body and soul shall both return and be united again. Time passes unobserved by us, as with men asleep; and when it is past, it is as nothing. It is a short and quickly-passing life, as the waters of a flood. Man does but flourish as the grass, which, when the winter of old age comes, will wither; but he may be mown down by disease or disaster.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/90.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before the mountains were brought forth - Before the earth brought forth or produced the mountains. In the description of the creation it would be natural to represent the mountains as the first objects that appeared, as emerging from the waters; and, therefore, as the "first" or "most ancient" of created objects. The phrase, therefore, is equivalent to saying, Before the earth was created. The literal meaning of the expression, "were brought forth," is, in the Hebrew, "were born." The mountains are mentioned as the most ancient things in creation, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>.<p>Or ever thou hadst formed - literally, "hadst brought forth." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-1.htm">Job 39:1</a>.<p>The earth and the world - The word "earth" here is used to denote the world as distinguished either from heaven <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, or from the sea <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>. The term "world" in the original is commonly employed to denote the earth considered as "inhabited," or as capable of being inhabited - a dwelling place for living beings.<p>Even from everlasting to everlasting - From duration stretching backward without limit to duration stretching forward without limit; that is, from eternal ages to eternal ages; or, forever.<p>Thou art God - Or, "Thou, O God." The idea is, that he was always, and ever will be, God: the God; the true God; the only God; the unchangeable God. At any period in the past, during the existence of the earth, or the heavens, or before either was formed, he existed, with all the attributes essential to Deity; at any period in the future - during the existence of the earth and the heavens, or beyond - far as the mind can reach into the future, and even beyond that - he will still exist unchanged, with all the attributes of Deity. The creation of the universe made no change in him; its destruction would not vary the mode of his existence, or make him in any respect a different being. There could not be a more absolute and unambiguous declaration, as there could not be one more sublime, of the eternity of God. The mind cannot take in a grander thought than that there is one eternal and immutable Being. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/90.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. brought forth [and] formed&#8212;both express the idea of production by birth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/90.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">The mountains</span>; which he mentions as the most fixed and stable part of the earth. <span class="ital">Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world</span>, i.e. from eternity; which is frequently described in this manner, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-25.htm" title="Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:">Proverbs 8:25</a>,26 Joh 17:24 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a></span>, because there was nothing before the creation of the world but eternity.

The music strikes in here, and how can it do so otherwise than in elegiac mesto? If God's justice tarries and fails in this present world, then the Old Testament faith becomes sorely tempted and tried, because it is not able to find consolation in the life beyond. Thus it is with the faith of the poet in the present juncture of affairs, the outward appearance of which is in such perplexing contradiction to the loving-kindness sworn to David and also hitherto vouchsafed. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; has not the sense in this passage of the promises of favour, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, but proofs of favour; &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; glances back at the long period of the reigns of David and of Solomon.<p>(Note: The Pasek between &#1495;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; is not designed merely to remove the limited predicate from the Lord, who is indeed the First and the Last, but also to secure its pronunciation to the guttural Aleph, which might be easily passed over after Mem; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-20.htm">Genesis 30:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>, and frequently.)<p>The Asaph <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77.htm">Psalm 77</a> and the Tephilla <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63.htm">Isaiah 63</a> contain similar complaints, just as in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a> one is reminded of the Asaph <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-2.htm">Psalm 79:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-10.htm">Psalm 79:10</a>, and in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-12.htm">Psalm 79:12</a>. The phrase &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493; is used in other instances of loving nurture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>. In this passage it must have a sense akin to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;. It is impossible on syntactic grounds to regard &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; as still dependent upon &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; (Ewald) or, as Hupfeld is fond of calling it, as a "post-liminiar" genitive. Can it be that the &#1499;&#1500; is perhaps a mutilation of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-15.htm">Ezekiel 36:15</a>, as Bttcher suggests?

The poet complains as a member of the nation, as a citizen of the empire, that he is obliged to foster many nations in his bosom, inasmuch as the land of Israel was overwhelmed by the Egyptians and their allies, the Libyans, Troglodytes, and Ethiopians. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a> cannot now be referred back over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a> to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; (qua&#770; calumnia&#770;), and yet the relative sense, not the confirmatory (because, quoniam), is at issue.
