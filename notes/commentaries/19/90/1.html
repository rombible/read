The favour and protection of God are the only sure rest and comfort of the soul in this evil world. Christ Jesus is the refuge and dwelling-place to which we may repair. We are dying creatures, all our comforts in the world are dying comforts, but God is an ever-living God, and believers find him so. When God, by sickness, or other afflictions, turns men to destruction, he thereby calls men to return unto him to repent of their sins, and live a new life. A thousand years are nothing to God's eternity: between a minute and a million of years there is some proportion; between time and eternity there is none. All the events of a thousand years, whether past or to come, are more present to the Eternal Mind, than what was done in the last hour is to us. And in the resurrection, the body and soul shall both return and be united again. Time passes unobserved by us, as with men asleep; and when it is past, it is as nothing. It is a short and quickly-passing life, as the waters of a flood. Man does but flourish as the grass, which, when the winter of old age comes, will wither; but he may be mown down by disease or disaster.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/90.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lord - Not &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;  Yahweh here, but &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  'Adona&#772;y. The word is properly rendered "Lord," but it is a term which is often applied to God. It indicates, however, nothing in regard to his character or attributes except that he is a "Ruler or Governor."<p>Thou hast been our dwelling-place - The Septuagint renders this, "refuge" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#788;  kataphuge&#772;. So the Latin Vulgate, "refugium;" and Luther, "Zuflucht." The Hebrew word - &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;  ma&#770;&#8219;o&#770;n - means properly a habitation, a dwelling, as of God in his temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-8.htm">Psalm 26:8</a>; heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>.

But here the idea seems to be, as in the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Luther, "a refuge"; a place to which one may come as to his home, as one does from a journey; from wandering; from toil; from danger: a place to which such a one naturally resorts, which he loves, and where he feels that he may rest secure. The idea is, that a friend of God has that feeling in respect to Him, which one has toward his own home - his abode - the place which he loves and calls his own.<p>In all generations - Margin, "generation and generation." That is, A succeeding generation has found him to be the same as the previous generation had.

Contrasting man's frailty with God's eternity, the writer mourns over it as the punishment of sin, and prays for a return of the divine favor. A Prayer [mainly such] of Moses the man of God&#8212;(De 33:1; Jos 14:6); as such he wrote this (see on [626]Ps 18:1, title, and [627]Ps 36:1, title).<p>1. dwelling-place&#8212;home (compare Eze 11:16), as a refuge (De 33:27).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/90.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.<p>2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.<p>3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest Return, ye children of men.<p>4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.<p>5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.<p>6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.<p>7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.<p>8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.<p>9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath; we spend our years as a tale that is told.<p>10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<p>11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a><p>"Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations." We must consider the whole Psalm as written for the tribes in the desert, and then we shall see the primary meaning of each verse. Moses, in effect, says - wanderers though we be in the howling wilderness, yet we find a home in thee, even as our forefathers did when they came out of Ur of the Chaldees and dwelt in tents among the Canaanites. To the saints the Lord Jehovah, the self-existent God, stands instead of mansion and rooftree; he shelters, comforts, protects, preserves, and cherishes all his own. Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the saints dwell in their God, and have always done so in all ages. Not in the tabernacle or the temple do we dwell, but in God himself; and this we have always done since there was a church in the world. We have not shifted our abode. King's palaces have vanished beneath the crumbling hand of time - they have been burned with fire and buried beneath mountains of ruins, but the imperial race of heaven has never lost its regal habitation. Go to the Palatine and see how the Caesars are forgotten of the halls which echoed to their despotic mandates, and resounded with the plaudits of the nations over which they ruled, and then look upward and see in the ever-living Jehovah the divine home of the faithful, untouched by so much as the finger of decay. Where dwelt our fathers, a hundred generations since, there dwell we still. It is of New Testament saints that the Holy Ghost has said, "He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in God and God in him!" It was a divine mouth which said, "Abide in me," and then added, "he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit." It is most sweet to speak with the Lord as Moses did, saying, "Lord, thou art our dwelling place," and it is wise to draw from the Lord's eternal condescensions reasons for expecting present and future mercies, as the Psalmist did in the next Psalm wherein he describes the safety of those who dwell in God.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a><p>continued...Who, considering that terrible but righteous sentence of God concerning the cutting off all that sinful generation in the wilderness, of which see <span class="bld">Numbers 14</span>, takes that occasion to publish these meditations concerning mans mortality and misery in this life, which might be useful both to that and to all succeeding generations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Moses, setting forth the eternity and providence of God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a>:2</span>, describeth the misery and shortness of man’s life, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/90-3.htm" title="You turn man to destruction; and say, Return, you children of men....">Psalm 90:3-11</a></span>; prayeth for wisdom to number his days, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-12.htm" title="So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.">Psalm 90:12</a></span>; and for the knowledge and sensible experience of God’s good providence, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/90-13.htm" title="Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent you concerning your servants....">Psalm 90:13-17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Although we and our fathers, for some generations, have had no certain and fixed habitation, but have been <span class="ital">strangers in a land that was not ours</span>, and <span class="ital">afflicted</span> for <span class="ital">four hundred years</span>, according to thy prediction, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a></span>; and although we now are, and have been for some time, and still are like to continue, in, a vast howling wilderness, having no houses but dwelling in tents, and wandering from place to place, we know not whither; yet thou, O Lord, hast fully supplied this want, and hast been instead of and better than a dwelling-place to us, by thy watchful and gracious providence over us in all places and exigencies.

Even when they had no certain dwelling place in the world; so their ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, dwelt in tabernacles in the land of promise, as in a strange land; and their posterity for many years served under great affliction and oppression in a land that was not theirs; and now they were dwelling in tents in the wilderness, and removing from place to place; but as the Lord had been in every age, so he now was the dwelling place of those that trusted in him; being that to them as an habitation is to man, in whom they had provision, protection, rest, and safety; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a> so all that believe in Christ dwell in him, and he in them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-56.htm">John 6:56</a>, they dwelt secretly in him before they believed; so they dwelt in his heart's love, in his arms, in him as their head in election, and as their representative in the covenant of grace from eternity; and, when they fell in Adam, they were preserved in Christ, dwelling in him; and so they were in him when on the cross, in the grave, and now in heaven; for they are said to be crucified, buried, and risen with him, and set down in heavenly places in him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, and, being converted, they have an open dwelling in him by faith, to whom they have fled for refuge, and in whom they dwell safely, quietly, comfortably, pleasantly, and shall never be turned out: here they have room, plenty of provisions, rest, and peace, and security from all evils; he is an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the storm.

For (1) to carry any one in one's bosom, if he is an enemy, may signify: to be obliged to cherish him with the vexation proceeding from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>), without being able to get rid of him; (2) there is no doubt that &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; can, after the manner of numerals, be placed before the substantive to which it belongs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-10.htm">Ezekiel 32:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-29.htm">Proverbs 31:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-28.htm">Nehemiah 9:28</a>; cf. the other position, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>; (3) consequently &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; may signify the "totality of many peoples" just as well as &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a>. The poet complains as a member of the nation, as a citizen of the empire, that he is obliged to foster many nations in his bosom, inasmuch as the land of Israel was overwhelmed by the Egyptians and their allies, the Libyans, Troglodytes, and Ethiopians. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a> cannot now be referred back over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a> to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; (qua&#770; calumnia&#770;), and yet the relative sense, not the confirmatory (because, quoniam), is at issue. We therefore refer it to &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, and take &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; as an apposition, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-20.htm">Psalm 139:20</a> : who reproach Thee, (as) Thine enemies, Jahve, who reproach the footsteps (&#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a> with Dag. dirimens, which gives it an emotional turn) of Thine anointed, i.e., they follow him everywhere, wheresoever he may go, and whatsoever he may do. With these significant words, &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498;, the Third Book of the Psalms dies away. </body></html>
