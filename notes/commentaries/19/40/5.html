There is power enough in God to help the weakest, and grace enough to help the unworthiest of all that trust in him. The psalmist waited patiently; he continued believing, hoping, and praying. This is applicable to Christ. His agony, in the garden and on the cross, was a horrible pit and miry clay. But those that wait patiently for God do not wait in vain. Those that have been under religious melancholy, and by the grace of God have been relieved, may apply ver. 2 very feelingly to themselves; they are brought up out of a horrible pit. Christ is the Rock on which a poor soul can alone stand fast. Where God has given stedfast hope, he expects there should be a steady, regular walk and conduct. God filled the psalmist with joy, as well as peace in believing. Multitudes, by faith beholding the sufferings and glory of Christ, have learned to fear the justice and trust in the mercy of God through Him. Many are the benefits with which we are daily loaded, both by the providence and by the grace of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done - literally, "Many (things), O Lord my God, hast thou done; thy wonderful things and thy thoughts toward us, it is not (possible) to state unto thee." The recollection of the particular kindness shown to the speaker, as referred to in the previous verses, suggests the recollection of the great number of wonders that God had done for his people - the acts of his kindness which it would be hopeless to attempt to recount before him. And who "could" enumerate and record all the acts of God's benevolence toward men in the works of creation, providence, and redemption; all that he has done in the history of the Church, and for the individual members of the Church in past times; all that he has done to save his people in the days of persecution; all that has been accomplished in our own individual lives? Obviously these things are beyond all power of enumeration by man. They can be admired now only in the gross; eternity alone will be sufficient for us to look at them and to recount them in detail. The phrase "wonderful works" means here remarkable interventions; things fitted to excite astonishment; things that surpass what man could have anticipated; things that could have been done only by God.<p>And thy thoughts which are to us-ward - Toward us; or which pertain to us. The word "thoughts" here refers to the plans, purposes, arrangements of God designed for our welfare; the things that are the result of his thinking of our wants - of what we need - of what would do us good. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-17.htm">Psalm 40:17</a>.<p>They cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee - Margin, "None can order them unto thee." Literally, "There is no putting them in order before thee;" that is, there is no such arranging of them, or disposing of them in order, that they can all be brought into their proper place, so as to be perceived or numbered. The Hebrew word - &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;  &#8219;a&#770;rak - means properly, to place in a row; to put in order; to arrange; as, to put an army in battle array, or to draw it up for battle, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-20.htm">Judges 20:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-22.htm">Judges 20:22</a>; to put words in order for an argument, or to arrange thoughts so as to present an argument, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-14.htm">Job 32:14</a>; to set a cause in order before a judge, or to lay it before him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18</a>. The word also means to place together with anything, or by the side of anything - that is, to make a comparison. Gesenius (Lexicon) supposes that this is the idea here, and that the proper interpretation is, "Nothing can be compared unto thee." But the other interpretation seems best to accord with the connection, as referring to the wonderful works of God, and to his thoughts of mercy and goodness as being beyond the power of computation, or as too numerous to be brought into order and arrangement before the mind.<p>If I would declare and speak of them - If I should attempt to speak of them; or to recount them.<p>They are more than can be numbered - More than man can enumerate. They go beyond the power of language to express them. This is literally true. No language of man can describe what God has done and has purposed in fitting up this world as an abode for people, and in his mercy toward them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. be reckoned up in order&#8212;(compare Ps 5:3; 33:14; Isa 44:7), too many to be set forth regularly.

As a reason for his being heard, David appeals to the instability and finite character of this earthly life in language which we also hear from his own lips in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512; is the stranger who travels about and sojourns as a guest in a country that is not his native land; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; is a sojourner, or one enjoying the protection of the laws, who, without possessing any hereditary title, has settled down there, and to whom a settlement is allotted by sufferance. The earth is God's; that which may be said of the Holy Land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>) may be said of the whole earth; man has no right upon it, he only remains there so long as God permits him. &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; glances back even to the patriarchs (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>). Israel is, it is true, at the present time in possession of a fixed dwelling-place, but only as the gift of his God, and for each individual it is only during his life, which is but a handbreadth long. May Jahve, then - so David prays - turn away His look of wrath from him, in order that he may shine forth, become cheerful or clear up, before he goes hence and it is too late. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is imper. apoc.

Hiph. of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>, without any necessity for explaining it as meaning obline (oculos tuos)  equals  connive (Abulwald), which would be an expression unworthy of God. It is on the contrary to be rendered: look away from me; on which compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-6.htm">Job 14:6</a>; on &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490;&#1492; cf. ib. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a>; on &#1488;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;&#1501;, ib.Job 10:21; on &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, ib. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-8.htm">Job 7:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>. The close of the Psalm, consequently, is re-echoed in many ways in the Book of Job The Book of Job is occupied with the same riddle as that with which this Psalm is occupied. But in the solution of it, it advances a step further. David does not know how to disassociate in his mind sin and suffering, and wrath and suffering. The Book of Job, on the contrary, thinks of suffering and love together; and in the truth that suffering also, even though it be unto death, must serve the highest interests of those who love God, it possesses a satisfactory solution. </body></html>
