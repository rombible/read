There is power enough in God to help the weakest, and grace enough to help the unworthiest of all that trust in him. The psalmist waited patiently; he continued believing, hoping, and praying. This is applicable to Christ. His agony, in the garden and on the cross, was a horrible pit and miry clay. But those that wait patiently for God do not wait in vain. Those that have been under religious melancholy, and by the grace of God have been relieved, may apply ver. 2 very feelingly to themselves; they are brought up out of a horrible pit. Christ is the Rock on which a poor soul can alone stand fast. Where God has given stedfast hope, he expects there should be a steady, regular walk and conduct. God filled the psalmist with joy, as well as peace in believing. Multitudes, by faith beholding the sufferings and glory of Christ, have learned to fear the justice and trust in the mercy of God through Him. Many are the benefits with which we are daily loaded, both by the providence and by the grace of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He brought me up also out of an horrible pit - Margin: "A pit of noise." The word used here means a pit; a cistern; a prison; a dungeon; a grave. This last signification of the word is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>. It may refer to any calamity - or to trouble, like being in a pit - or it may refer to the grave. The word rendered "horrible" - &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;  sha&#770;'o&#770;n - means properly "noise, uproar, tumult," as of waters; of a crowd of men; of war. Then it seems to be used in the sense of "desolation" or "destruction," as applicable to the grave. DeWette understands it here of a pit, a cavern, or an abyss that roars or is tumultuous; that is, that is impassable. Perhaps this is the idea - a cavern, deep and dark, where the waters roar, and which seems to be filled with horrors. So Rosenmuller understands it. The Septuagint renders it: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  ek lakkou talaipo&#772;rias, "a lake of misery." It is a deep and horrid cavern, where there is no hope of being rescued, or where it would seem that there would be certain destruction.<p>Out of the miry clay - At the bottom of the pit. Where there was no solid ground - no rock on which to stand. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a>.<p>And set my feet upon a rock - Where there was firm standing.<p>And established my goings - Or, fixed my steps. That is, he enabled me to walk as on solid ground; he conducted me along safely, where there was no danger of descending to the pit again or of sinking in the mire. If we understand this of the Redeemer, it refers to that time when, his sorrows ended, and his work of atonement done, it became certain that he would never be exposed again to such dangers, or sink into such a depth of woes, but that his course ever onward would be one of safety and of glory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 40<p>Ps 40:1-17. In this Psalm a celebration of God's deliverance is followed by a profession of devotion to His service. Then follows a prayer for relief from imminent dangers, involving the overthrow of enemies and the rejoicing of sympathizing friends. In Heb 10:5, &c., Paul quotes Ps 40:6-8 as the words of Christ, offering Himself as a better sacrifice. Some suppose Paul thus accommodated David's words to express Christ's sentiments. But the value of his quotation would be thus destroyed, as it would have no force in his argument, unless regarded by his readers as the original sense of the passage in the Old Testament. Others suppose the Psalm describes David's feelings in suffering and joy; but the language quoted by Paul, in the sense given by him, could not apply to David in any of his relations, for as a type the language is not adapted to describe any event or condition of David's career, and as an individual representing the pious generally, neither he nor they could properly use it (see on [584]Ps 40:7, below). The Psalm must be taken then, as the sixteenth, to express the feelings of Christ's human nature. The difficulties pertinent to this view will be considered as they occur.<p>1-3. The figures for deep distress are illustrated in Jeremiah's history (Jer 38:6-12). Patience and trust manifested in distress, deliverance in answer to prayer, and the blessed effect of it in eliciting praise from God's true worshippers, teach us that Christ's suffering is our example, and His deliverance our encouragement (Heb 5:7, 8; 12:3; 1Pe 4:12-16).<p>inclined&#8212;(the ear, Ps 17:6), as if to catch the faintest sigh.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I waited patiently, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">in waiting I waited</span>; which doubling of the word notes that he waited diligently and earnestly, patiently and perseveringly, until God should please to help him. <span class="ital">He inclined</span>, or, <span class="ital">bowed</span>, to wit, <span class="ital">himself</span>, as this very word is rendered, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-30.htm" title="And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.

The explanation that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> here is to be taken in the secondary sense of "destruction" or "misery," seems to me preferable (see the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of the miry</span> <span class="cmt_word">clay</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2, 14</a>).

The answer to this question which he himself throws out is, that Jahve is the goal of his waiting or hoping. It might appear strange that the poet is willing to make the brevity of human life a reason for being calm, and a ground of comfort. But here we have the explanation. Although not expressly assured of a future life of blessedness, his faith, even in the midst of death, lays hold on Jahve as the Living One and as the God of the living. It is just this which is so heroic in the Old Testament faith, that in the midst of the riddles of the present, and in the face of the future which is lost in dismal night, it casts itself unreservedly into the arms of God. While, however, sin is the root of all evil, the poet prays in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a> before all else, that God would remove from him all the transgressions by which he has fully incurred his affliction; and while, given over to the consequences of his sin, he would become, not only to his own dishonour but also to the dishonour of God, a derision to the unbelieving, he prays in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a> that God would not permit it to come to this. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a>, has Mercha, and is consequently, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-10.htm">Psalm 35:10</a>, to be read with  (not o&#774;), since an accent can never be placed by Kametz chatu&#770;ph. Concerning &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>. As to the rest he is silent and calm; for God is the author, viz., of his affliction (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, used just as absolutely as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-11.htm">Psalm 52:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a>). Without ceasing still to regard intently the prosperity of the ungodly, he recognises the hand of God in his affliction, and knows that he has not merited anything better. But it is permitted to him to pray that God would suffer mercy to take the place of right. &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;&#1498; is the name he gives to his affliction, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-12.htm">Psalm 38:12</a>, as being a stroke (blow) of divine wrath; &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498;, as a quarrel into which God's hand has fallen with him; and by &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, with the almighty (punishing) hand of God, he contrasts himself the feeble one, to whom, if the present state of things continues, ruin is certain. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a> he puts his own personal experience into the form of a general maxim: when with rebukes (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514;, collateral form with &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;) Thou chastenest a man on account of iniquity (perf. conditionale), Thou makest his pleasantness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), i.e., his bodily beauty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a>), to melt away, moulder away (&#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1505;, fut. apoc. from &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1492; to cause to melt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>), like the moth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-12.htm">Hosea 5:12</a>), so that it falls away, as a moth-eaten garment falls into rags. Thus do all men become mere nothing. They are sinful and perishing. The thought expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a> is here repeated as a refrain. The music again strikes in here, as there. </body></html>
