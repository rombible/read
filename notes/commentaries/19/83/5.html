But then we may call upon him, as the psalmist here. All wicked people are God's enemies, especially wicked persecutors. The Lord's people are his hidden one; the world knows them not. He takes them under his special protection. Do the enemies of the church act with one consent to destroy it, and shall not the friends of the church be united? Wicked men wish that there might be no religion among mankind. They would gladly see all its restraints shaken off, and all that preach, profess, or practise it, cut off. This they would bring to pass if it were in their power. The enemies of God's church have always been many: this magnifies the power of the Lord in preserving to himself a church in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/83.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For they have consulted together with one consent - Margin, as in Hebrew, heart. There is no division in their counsels on this subject. They have one desire - one purpose - in regard to the matter. Pilate and Herod were made friends together against Christ <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-12.htm">Luke 23:12</a>; and the world, divided and hostile on other matters, has been habitually united in its opposition to Christ and to a pure and spiritual religion.<p>They are confederate against thee - literally, "They cut a covenant against thee;" that is, they ratify such a covenant, compact, league - referring to the manner in which bargains and agreements were ratified by cutting in pieces a victim sacrificed on such occasions; that is, by giving to such a transaction the solemnity of a religious sanction. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-10.htm">Genesis 15:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18-19</a>. See Bochart, Hieroz. i. 35.

Selah.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5</a><p>"For they have consulted together with one consent." They are hearty and unanimous in their designs. They seem to have but one heart, and that a fierce one, against the chosen people and their God. "They are confederate against thee." At the Lord himself they aim through the sides of his saints. They make a covenant, and ratify it with blood, resolutely banding themselves together to war with the Mighty God.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-6.htm">Psalm 83:6</a><p>"The tabernacles of Edom." Nearest of kin, yet first in enmity. Their sire despised the birthright, and they despise the possessors of it. Leaving their rock-built mansions for the tents of war, the Edomites invaded the land of Israel. "And the Ishmaelites." A persecuting spirit ran in their blood, they perpetuated the old grudge between the child of the bondwoman and the son of the freewoman. "Of Moab." Born of incest, but yet a near kinsman, the feud of Moab against Israel was very bitter. Little could righteous Lot have dreamed that his unhallowed seed would be such unrelenting enemies of his uncle Abraham's posterity. "And the Hagarenes" - perhaps descendants of Hagar by a second husband. Whoever they may have been, they cast their power into the wrong scale, and with all their might sought the ruin of Israel. Children of Hagar, and all others who dwell around Mount Sinai, which is in Arabia, are of the seed which gendereth to bondage, and hence they hate the seed according to promise.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a><p>"Gebal" was probably a near neighbour of Edom, though there was a Gebal in the region of Tyre and Sidon. "And Ammon, and Amalek." Two other hereditary foes of Israel, fierce and remorseless as ravening wolves. In the roll of infamy let these names remain detestably immortalised. How thick they stand! Their name is legion, for they are many. Alas, poor Israel, how art thou to stand against such a Bloody League? Nor is this all. Here comes another tribe of ancient foemen, "the Philistines;" who once blinded Samson, and captured the ark of the Lord; and here are old allies become new enemies; the builders of the temple conspiring to pull it down, even "the inhabitants of Tyre." These last were mercenaries who cared not at whose bidding they drew sword, so long as they carved something for their own advantage. True religion has had its quarrel with merchants and craftsmen, and because it has interfered with their gains, they have conspired against it.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-8.htm">Psalm 83:8</a><p>"Assur is also joined with them." It was then a rising power, anxious for growth, and it thus early distinguished itself for evil. What a motley group they were; a league against Israel is always attractive, and gathers whole nations within its bonds. Herod and Pilate are friends, if Jesus is to be crucified. Romanism and Ritualism make common cause against the gospel. "They have holpen the children of Lot." All these have come to the aid of Moab and Ammon, which two nations were among the fiercest in the conspiracy. There were ten to one against Israel, and yet she overcame all her enemies. Her name is not blotted out; but many, nay, most of her adversaries are now a name only, their power and their excellence are alike gone.<p>"Selah." There was good reason for a pause when the nation was In such jeopardy 'and yet it needs faith to make a pause, for unbelief is always in a hurry. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/83.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They have laid aside all their private quarrels and animosities, and agreed together against thee. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/83.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For they have consulted together with one consent,.... Or "heart" (e); wicked men are cordial to one another, and united in their counsels against the people of God, and his interest: whatever things they may disagree in, they agree in this, to oppose the cause and interest of true religion, or to persecute the church and people of God: Herod and Pontius Pilate are instances of this: <p>they are confederate against thee; or have made a covenant against thee (f); the covenant they had entered into among themselves, being against the Lord's people, was against him; and such a covenant and agreement can never stand; for there is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>.

An enumeration of the confederate peoples. From the southeast come the Edomites, who inhabited the mountainous region between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Akaba, and the Ishmaelites, who roamed over the deserts from the borders of Egypt to the north-west shore of the Persian Gulf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-18.htm" title="And they dwelled from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brothers.">Genesis 25:18</a>): from the east of the Dead Sea come the Moabites, and from the north-east the Hagarenes or Hagrites who lived in the neighbourhood of the Hauran, east of Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-10.htm" title="And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelled in their tents throughout all the east land of Gilead.">1 Chronicles 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/5-19.htm" title="And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab....">1 Chronicles 5:19-20</a>);—they are mentioned in the inscriptions of Sennacherib along with the Nabatheans. Gebal is not the Gebal of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm" title="The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:9</a> to the north of Tyre (Byblus), but the northern part of the mountains of Edom, southward of the Dead Sea, a district known to Pliny as Gebalene. The Ammonites, ancient and bitter foes of Israel, come from their home beyond the Jordan, the Amalekites from the southern deserts between the Arabah and the Mediterranean. The maritime states of the Philistines on the west and Tyre on the north have joined them, and even the remote Assyria sends a contingent to support the confederacy.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/83.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they have consulted together with one consent</span> (comp. ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">They are confederate against thee;</span> literally, <span class="accented">have entered into a covenant against thee.</span> A formal treaty seems to be intended. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/82.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>What now follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a> is not a parenthetical assertion of the inefficiency with which the divine correction rebounds from the judges and rulers. In connection with this way of taking <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>, the manner in which the divine language is continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a> is harsh and unadjusted. God Himself speaks in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a> of the judges, but reluctantly alienated from them; and confident of the futility of all attempts to make them better, He tells them their sentence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>. The verbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a> are designedly without any object: complaint of the widest compass is made over their want of reason and understanding; and &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493; takes the perfect form in like manner to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, noverunt, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-18.htm">Isaiah 44:18</a>. Thus, then, no result is to be expected from the divine admonition: they still go their ways in this state of mental darkness, and that, as the Hithpa. implies, stalking on in carnal security and self-complacency. The commands, however, which they transgress are the foundations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a>), as it were the shafts and pillars (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-4.htm">Proverbs 29:4</a>), upon which rests the permanence of all earthly relationships with are appointed by creation and regulated by the T&#x3c4;ra. Their transgression makes the land, the earth, to totter physically and morally, and is the prelude of its overthrow. When the celestial Lord of the domain thinks upon this destruction which injustice and tyranny are bringing upon the earth, His wrath kindles, and He reminds the judges and rulers that it is His own free declaratory act which has clothed them with the god-like dignity which they bear. They are actually elohim, but not possessed of the right of self-government; there is a Most High (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) to whom they as sons are responsible. The idea that the appellation elohim, which they have given to themselves, is only sarcastically given back to them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-1.htm">Psalm 82:1</a> (Ewald, Olshausen), is refuted by <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>, according to which they are really elohim by the grace of God. But if their practice is not an Amen to this name, then they shall be divested of the majesty which they have forfeited; they shall be divested of the prerogative of Israel, whose vocation and destiny they have belied. They shall die off &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, like common men not rising in any degree above the mass (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, opp. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>); they shall fall like any one (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-7.htm">Judges 16:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>) of the princes who in the course of history have been cast down by the judgment of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-7.htm">Hosea 7:7</a>). Their divine office will not protect them. For although justitia civilis is far from being the righteousness that avails before God, yet injustitia civilis is in His sight the vilest abomination. </body></html>
