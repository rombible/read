But then we may call upon him, as the psalmist here. All wicked people are God's enemies, especially wicked persecutors. The Lord's people are his hidden one; the world knows them not. He takes them under his special protection. Do the enemies of the church act with one consent to destroy it, and shall not the friends of the church be united? Wicked men wish that there might be no religion among mankind. They would gladly see all its restraints shaken off, and all that preach, profess, or practise it, cut off. This they would bring to pass if it were in their power. The enemies of God's church have always been many: this magnifies the power of the Lord in preserving to himself a church in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/83.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Keep not thou silence, O God - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>. The prayer here is that in the existing emergency God would not seem to be indifferent to the needs and dangers of his people, and to the purposes of their enemies, but that he would speak with a voice of command, and break up their designs.<p>Hold not thy peace - That is, Speak. Give commaud. Disperse them by thine own authority.<p>And be not still, O God - Awake; arouse; be not indifferent to the needs and dangers of thy people. All this is the language of petition; not of command. Its rapidity, its repetition, its tone, all denote that the danger was imminent, and that the necessity for the divine interposition was urgent. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/83.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 83<p>Ps 83:1-18. Of Asaph&#8212;(See on [615]Ps 74:1, title). The historical occasion is probably that of 2Ch 20:1, 2 (compare Ps 47:1-9; 48:1-14). After a general petition, the craft and rage of the combined enemies are described, God's former dealings recited, and a like summary and speedy destruction on them is invoked.<p>1. God addressed as indifferent (compare Ps 35:22; 39:12).<p>be not still&#8212;literally, "not quiet," as opposed to action.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/83.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.<p>2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.<p>3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.<p>4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-1.htm">Psalm 83:1</a><p>"Keep not thou silence, O God." Man is clamorous, be not thou speechless. He rails and reviles, wilt not thou reply? One word of thine can deliver thy people; therefore, O Lord, break thy quiet and let thy voice be heard. "Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God." Here the appeal is to El, the Mighty One. He is entreated to act and speak, because his nation suffers and is in great jeopardy. Now entirely the Psalmist looks to God; he asks not for "a leader bold and brave," or for any form of human force, but casts his burden upon the Lord, being well assured that his eternal power and Godhead could meet every difficulty of the case.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-2.htm">Psalm 83:2</a><p>"For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult." They are by no means sparing of their words, they are like a hungry pack of dogs, all giving tongue at once. So sure are they of devouring thy people that they already shout over the feast. "And they that hate thee have lifted up the head." Confident of conquest, they carry themselves proudly and exalt themselves as if their anticipated victories were already obtained. These enemies of Israel were also God's enemies, and are here described as such by way of adding intensity to the argument of the intercession. The adversaries of the church are usually a noisy and a boastful crew. Their pride is a brass which always sounds, a cymbal which is ever tinkling.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-3.htm">Psalm 83:3</a><p>"They have taken crafty counsel against thy people." Whatever we may do, our enemies use their wits and lay their heads together; in united conclave they discourse upon the demands and plans of the campaign, using much treachery and serpentine cunning in arranging their schemes. Malice is cold-blooded enough to plot with deliberation; and pride, though it be never wise, is often allied with craft. "And consulted against thy hidden ones." Hidden away from all harm are the Lord's chosen; their enemies think not so, but hope to smite them; they might as well attempt to destroy the angels before the throne of God.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-4.htm">Psalm 83:4</a><p>"They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation." Easier said than done. Yet it shows how thorough-going are the foes of the church. Theirs was the policy of extermination. They laid the axe at the root of the matter. Rome has always loved this method of warfare, and hence she has gloated over the massacre of Bartholomew, and the murders of the Inquisition. "That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance." They would blot them out of history as well as out of existence. Evil is intolerant of good. If Israel would let Edom alone yet Edom cannot be quiet, but seeks like its ancestor to kill the chosen of the Lord. Men would be glad to cast the church out of the world because it rebukes them, and is thus a standing menace to their sinful peace. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The occasion of the Psalm is manifest from the body of it, and it seems to have been a dangerous attempt and conspiracy. of divers neighbouring nations against Israel or Judah.

The "congregation of God" is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-16.htm">Joshua 22:16</a>., "the congregation of (the sons of) Israel," which God has purchased from among the nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a>), and upon which as its Lawgiver He has set His divine impress. The psalmist and seer sees Elohim standing in this congregation of God. The part. Niph. (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-13.htm">Isaiah 3:13</a>) denotes not so much the suddenness and unpreparedness, as, rather, the statue-like immobility and terrifying designfulness of His appearance. Within the range of the congregation of God this holds good of the elohim. The right over life and death, with which the administration of justice cannot dispense, is a prerogative of God. From the time of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, however, He has transferred the execution of this prerogative to mankind, and instituted in mankind an office wielding the sword of justice, which also exists in His theocratic congregation, but here has His positive law as the basis of its continuance and as the rule of its action. Everywhere among men, but here pre-eminently, those in authority are God's delegates and the bearers of His image, and therefore as His representatives are also themselves called elohim, "gods" (which the lxx in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a> renders &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, and the Targums here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7-8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a> uniformly, &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;). The God who has conferred this exercise of power upon these subordinate elohim, without their resigning it of themselves, now sits in judgment in their midst. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; of that which takes place before the mind's eye of the psalmist. How long, He asks, will ye judge unjustly? &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; is equivalent to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a> (the opposite is &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>). How long will ye accept the countenance of the wicked, i.e., incline to accept, regard, favour the person of the wicked? The music, which here becomes forte, gives intensity to the terrible sternness (das Niederdonnernde) of the divine question, which seeks to bring the "gods" of the earth to their right mind. Then follow admonitions to do that which they have hitherto left undone. They are to cause the benefit of the administration of justice to tend to the advantage of the defenceless, of the destitute, and of the helpless, upon whom God the Lawgiver especially keeps His eye. The word &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;), of which there is no evidence until within the time of David and Solomon, is synonymous with &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;. &#1491;&#1500; with &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501; is pointed &#1491;&#1500;, and with &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, on account of the closer notional union, &#1491;&#1500; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-13.htm">Psalm 72:13</a>). They are words which are frequently repeated in the prophets, foremost in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>), with which is enjoined upon those invested with the dignity of the law, and with jurisdiction, justice towards those who cannot and will not themselves obtain their rights by violence. </body></html>
