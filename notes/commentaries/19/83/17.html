God is the same still that ever he was; the same to his people, and the same against his and their enemies. God would make their enemies like a wheel; unsettled in all their counsels and resolves. Not only let them be driven away as stubble, but burnt as stubble. And this will be the end of wicked men. Let them be made to fear thy name, and perhaps that will bring them to seek thy name. We should desire no confusion to our enemies and persecutors but what may forward their conversion. The stormy tempest of Divine vengeance will overtake them, unless they repent and seek the pardoning mercy of their offended Lord. God's triumphs over his enemies, clearly prove that he is, according to his name JEHOVAH, an almighty Being, who has all power and perfection in himself. May we fear his wrath, and yield ourselves to be his willing servants. And let us seek deliverance by the destruction of our fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/83.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let them be confounded - Let them be ashamed. That is, Let them have that kind of shame and confusion which results from the fact that their plans have not been successful, or that they have been foiled and baffled in their schemes.<p>And troubled - Disturbed; put to confusion. Let them be troubled as men are who are unsuccessful in their projects.<p>Forever - As a people; as confederated nations; as united in such an unholy alliance. Let them never again be able thus to combine, or to form a compact for the destruction of thy people. This does not refer to them as individuals, but as nations. It is a prayer that they may be so discomfited now that they may see the wickedness and folly of all such efforts, and that they may never again form such a combination.<p>Yea, let them be put to shame - By utter failure in their schemes.<p>And perish - Not individually, but as combined - as an alliance. Let there be a complete end to such a confederacy, so that it shall never be seen again. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/83.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. that they may seek&#8212;or as Ps 83:18, supply "men," since Ps 83:17, 18 amplify the sentiment of Ps 83:16, expressing more fully the measure of destruction, and the lesson of God's being and perfections (compare 2Ch 20:29) taught to all men.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/83.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> But those of them that will not humble themselves before thee, let them be utterly destroyed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/83.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let them be confounded and troubled for ever,....

Like Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-20.htm">Isaiah 37:20</a>), the psalmist desires nothing so much as that "all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Jehovah, and he only, is God," and may turn to him in sincerity and truth. It is for this end that he wishes them to be brought low, even to the verge of destruction. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/83.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; reference is made to Gideon's victory over the Midianites, which belongs to the most glorious recollections of Israel, and to which in other instances, too, national hopes are attached, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a> [4], <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>; and with the asyndeton &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1505;&#1512;&#1488; &#1499;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; (&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1505;&#1512;&#1488;, as Norzi states, who does not rightly understand the placing of the Metheg) to the victory of Barak and Deborah over Sisera and the Canaanitish king Jabin, whose general he was. The Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is like the Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-7.htm">Psalm 110:7</a> : according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a> the Kishon carried away the corpses of the slain army. &#8219;Endo&#770;r, near Tabor, and therefore situated not far distant from Taanach and Megiddo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>), belonged to the battle-field. &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;, starting from the radical notion of that which flatly covers anything, which lies in &#1491;&#1501;, signifying the covering of earth lying flat over the globe, therefore humus (like &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, terra, and &#1514;&#1489;&#1500;, tellus), is here (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>) in accord with &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503; (from &#1491;&#1502;&#1503;), which is in substance akin to it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-12.htm">Psalm 83:12</a> we have a retrospective glance at Gideon's victory. &#8219;Oreb and Zee&#772;b were &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; of the Midianites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; Zebach and Tsalmunna&#8219;, their kings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5</a>.<p>(Note: The Syriac Hexapla has (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>) &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1506; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1503;, a substitution which is accepted by Geiger, Deutsch.
