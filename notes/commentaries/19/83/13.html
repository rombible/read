Grove (Smith’s <span class= "ital">Bibl. Dict., </span>art. Oreb) says, “like the spherical masses of dry weeds which course over the plains of Esdraelon and Philistia.” He possibly refers to the wild artichoke, which struck Mr. Thomson so forcibly as the origin of the psalmist’s figure. He describes them as vegetable globes, light as a feather, which, when the parent stem breaks, become the sport of the wind. “At the proper season thousands of them come suddenly over the plain, rolling, leaping, bounding with vast racket, to the dismay both of the horse and rider.” To this day the Arabs, who call it ‘<span class= "ital">akhûb, </span>employ it in the same figurative way:—<p>“May you be whirled like ‘<span class= "ital">akhûb </span>before the wind!”<p>THOMSON: <span class= "ital">Land and Book, </span>563.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/83.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/83-13.htm" title="O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind....">Psalm 83:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">O my God, make them like a wheel </span>— Whereas they promise themselves a sure possession, let them be like a <span class="ital">wheel, </span>or a <span class="ital">round</span> <span class="ital">ball, </span>which is very unstable, and soon removed, and which, when once tumbled down from the top of a hill, runs with great force and swiftness, and stays not till it comes to the bottom. Bishop Patrick interprets the clause thus: “Let them not be able to stand their ground, but put them to flight, and make them run as swiftly as a ball down a hill.” <span class="ital">As the stubble before the wind — </span>“Disperse all their forces like the chaff when it is blown about with a furious wind.” Some think that in this and the following verse the psalmist alludes to the manner of thrashing in Judea; which was generally performed on a mountain, where the corn was thrashed by means of a wheel which run over the stalks. The chaff, on account of this situation, was easily blown about by the wind; and, it being customary likewise to burn what remained, it is with great propriety that the psalmist concludes the description with these words, <span class="ital">As the flame setteth the mountains on fire, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-14.htm" title="As the fire burns a wood, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire;">Psalm 83:14</a>.

God is the same still that ever he was; the same to his people, and the same against his and their enemies. God would make their enemies like a wheel; unsettled in all their counsels and resolves. Not only let them be driven away as stubble, but burnt as stubble. And this will be the end of wicked men. Let them be made to fear thy name, and perhaps that will bring them to seek thy name. We should desire no confusion to our enemies and persecutors but what may forward their conversion. The stormy tempest of Divine vengeance will overtake them, unless they repent and seek the pardoning mercy of their offended Lord. God's triumphs over his enemies, clearly prove that he is, according to his name JEHOVAH, an almighty Being, who has all power and perfection in himself. May we fear his wrath, and yield ourselves to be his willing servants. And let us seek deliverance by the destruction of our fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/83.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O my God, make them like a wheel ... - Or rather, like a rolling thing - something that the wind rolls along.

Of the confederate peoples the chronicler (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>) mentions the Moabites, the Ammonites, the inhabitants of Mount Ser, and the Me(unim, instead of which Josephus, Antiq. ix. 1. 2, says: a great body of Arabians.

The tents of Edom and of the Ishmaelites are (cf. Arab. ahl, people) the people themselves who live in tents. Moreover, too, the poet ranges the hostile nations according to their geographical position. The seven first named from Edom to Amalek, which still existed at the time of the psalmist (for the final destruction of the Amalekites by the Simeonites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>., falls at an indeterminate period prior to the Exile), are those out of the regions east and south-east of the Dead Sea. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a>, the Ishmaelites had spread from Higz through the peninsula of Sinai beyond the eastern and southern deserts as far up as the countries under the dominion of Assyria. The Hagarenes dwelt in tents from the Persian Gulf as far as the east of Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-10.htm">1 Chronicles 5:10</a>) towards the Euphrates. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, Arab. jba&#770;l, is the name of the people inhabiting the mountains situated in the south of the Dead Sea, that is to say, the northern Seritish mountains. Both Gebl and also, as it appears, the Amalek intended here according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a> (cf. Josephus, Antiq. ii. 1. 2: &#x391;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, a part of Idumaea), belong to the wide circuit of Edom. Then follow the Philistines and Phoenicians, the two nations of the coast of the Mediterranean, which also appear in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1-15</a> (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3.htm">Joel 3</a>) as making common cause with the Edomites against Israel. Finally Asshur, the nation of the distant north-east, here not as yet appearing as a principal power, but strengthening (vid., concerning &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;, an arm  equals  assistance, succour, Gesenius, Thesaurus, p. 433b) the sons of Lot, i.e., the Moabites and Ammonites, with whom the enterprise started, and forming a powerful reserve for them. The music bursts forth angrily at the close of this enumeration, and imprecations discharge themselves in the following strophe. </body></html>
