That word which stills the stormy ocean, and speaks it into a calm, can silence our enemies. How contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, it is hard to say which is most welcome. Does the watchman wait for the morning? so does the labourer earnestly desire the shades of evening. Some understand it of the morning and evening sacrifices. We are to look upon daily worship, both alone and with our families, to be the most needful of our daily occupations, the most delightful of our daily comforts. How much the fruitfulness of this lower part of the creation depends upon the influence of the upper, is easy to observe; every good and perfect gift is from above. He who enriches the earth, which is filled with man's sins, by his abundant and varied bounty, can neither want power nor will to feed the souls of his people. Temporal mercies to us unworthy creatures, shadow forth more important blessings. The rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring forth of the influences of the Holy Spirit, that river of God, full of the waters of life and salvation, render the hard, barren, worthless hearts of sinners fruitful in every good work, and change the face of nations more than the sun and rain change the face of nature. Wherever the Lord passes, by his preached gospel, attended by his Holy Spirit, his paths drop fatness, and numbers are taught to rejoice in and praise him. They will descend upon the pastures of the wilderness, all the earth shall hear and embrace the gospel, and bring forth abundantly the fruits of righteousness which are, through Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father. Manifold and marvellous, O Lord, are thy works, whether of nature or of grace; surely in loving-kindness hast thou made them all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly - Or rather, its furrows, for so the Hebrew word properly means. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-38.htm">Job 31:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-10.htm">Job 39:10</a>.

The idea is, to soften, to loosen, to make the soil light and open.

Kimchi calls them the eminences of the earth, the little hills, the higher parts of ploughed land; those which lie between furrow and furrow seem to be meant, which being watered with rain become lower, and are made fruitful: these may denote such as are lifted up with their own imaginary purity and righteousness; and who, when the grace of God takes hold upon them, are humbled, and confess themselves the chief of sinners and the least of saints, renounce their own righteousness, and submit to Christ's; <p>thou settlest the furrows thereof; or "thou causest the rain to descend into the furrows thereof" (p); which fills them, and makes them fruitful; and may design humble souls, whom the Lord fills with his good things, and makes them fruitful in every good work; <p>thou makest it soft with showers; which through drought is become like iron and brass, and, without large and heavy showers, as the word (q) used signifies, and these repeated, it is so hard, that no impressions can be made upon it, nor anything spring out of it; and such is the hard heart of man, which God only can make soft by the means of his word, through the energy of his Spirit, and the efficacy of his grace; which coming in great abundance, like large showers of rain, removes the hardness of the heart, makes it susceptible of divine impressions, and of receiving the seed of the word, whereby it becomes fruitful; <p>thou blessest the springing thereof; the tender blade, when it first peeps out of the earth; this the Lord nourishes and cherishes; he preserves it from the nipping frosts, by covering it with snow; he waters it with the dews of heaven, and warms it with the beams of the sun; he causes it to grow, and brings it to perfection: so the Lord takes great notice of the springing and buddings forth of grace, of the first acts and exercises of it in young converts, and takes care of them; and as he will not hurt them himself, nor break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax; so he takes care that others should not; see Sol 6:11; he gives them more grace, and strengthens what they have; causes it to grow, and brings it on to perfection. The word here used is the same by which Christ, the branch, is expressed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; and as the Lord has blessed him with the blessings of goodness, so he blesses all the branches which are in him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>. <p>(p)  "descendere facis pluviam in sulcos ejus", Vatablus.

The lxx renders &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, but &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, tibi par est, h. e. convenit laus (Ewald), is not a usage of the language (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-1.htm">Psalm 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-7.htm">Jeremiah 10:7</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; signifies, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>, silence, and as an ethical notion, resignation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>. According to the position of the words it looks like the subject, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; like the predicate. The accents at least (Illuj, Shalsheleth) assume the relationship of the one word to the other to be that of predicate and subject; consequently it is not: To Thee belongeth resignation, praise (Hengstenberg), but: To Thee is resignation praise, i.e., resignation is (given or presented) to Thee as praise. Hitzig obtains the same meaning by an alteration of the text: &#1500;&#1498; &#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;; but opposed to this is the fact that &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1500; is not found anywhere in the Psalter, but only in the writings of the chronicler. And since it is clear that the words &#1500;&#1498; &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; belong together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>), the poet had no need to fear any ambiguity when he inserted dmyh between them as that which is given to God as praise in Zion. What is intended is that submission or resignation to God which gives up its cause to God and allows Him to act on its behalf, renouncing all impatient meddling and interference (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>). The second member of the sentence affirms that this praise of pious resignation does not remain unanswered. Just as God in Zion is praised by prayer which resigns our own will silently to His, so also to Him are vows paid when He fulfils such prayer. That the answers to prayer are evidently thought of in connection with this, we see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-3.htm">Psalm 65:3</a>, where God is addressed as the "Hearer or Answerer of prayer." To Him as being the Hearer and Answerer of prayer all flesh comes, and in fact, as &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; implies (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>), without finding help anywhere else, it clear a way for itself until it gets to Him; i.e., men, absolutely dependent, impotent in themselves and helpless, both collectively and individually (those only excepted who are determined to perish or despair), flee to Him as their final refuge and help. Before all else it is the prayer for the forgiveness of sin which He graciously answers. The perfect in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a> is followed by the future in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>. The former, in accordance with the sense, forms a hypothetical protasis: granted that the instances of faults have been too powerful for me, i.e., (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-13.htm">Genesis 4:13</a>) an intolerable burden to me, our transgressions are expiated by Thee (who alone canst and also art willing to do it). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is not less significant than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-18.htm">2 Samuel 11:18</a>.: it separates the general fact into its separate instances and circumstances. How blessed therefore is the lot of that man whom (supply &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;) God chooses and brings near, i.e., removes into His vicinity, that he may inhabit His courts (future with the force of a clause expressing a purpose, as e.g., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>, which see), i.e., that there, where He sits enthroned and reveals Himself, he may have his true home and be as if at home (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>)! The congregation gathered around Zion is esteemed worthy of this distinction among the nations of the earth; it therefore encourages itself in the blessed consciousness of this its privilege flowing from free grace (&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;), to enjoy in full draughts (&#1513;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506; with &#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>) the abundant goodness or blessing (&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;) of God's house, of the holy (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) of His temple, i.e., of His holy temple (&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>). For for all that God's grace offers us we can give Him no better thanks than to hunger and thirst after it, and satisfy our poor soul therewith. </body></html>
