That word which stills the stormy ocean, and speaks it into a calm, can silence our enemies. How contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, it is hard to say which is most welcome. Does the watchman wait for the morning? so does the labourer earnestly desire the shades of evening. Some understand it of the morning and evening sacrifices. We are to look upon daily worship, both alone and with our families, to be the most needful of our daily occupations, the most delightful of our daily comforts. How much the fruitfulness of this lower part of the creation depends upon the influence of the upper, is easy to observe; every good and perfect gift is from above. He who enriches the earth, which is filled with man's sins, by his abundant and varied bounty, can neither want power nor will to feed the souls of his people. Temporal mercies to us unworthy creatures, shadow forth more important blessings. The rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring forth of the influences of the Holy Spirit, that river of God, full of the waters of life and salvation, render the hard, barren, worthless hearts of sinners fruitful in every good work, and change the face of nations more than the sun and rain change the face of nature. Wherever the Lord passes, by his preached gospel, attended by his Holy Spirit, his paths drop fatness, and numbers are taught to rejoice in and praise him. They will descend upon the pastures of the wilderness, all the earth shall hear and embrace the gospel, and bring forth abundantly the fruits of righteousness which are, through Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father. Manifold and marvellous, O Lord, are thy works, whether of nature or of grace; surely in loving-kindness hast thou made them all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains - Fixing them firm on their foundations. This is an exhibition of vast strength or power on the part of God, as if he fixed them so firm that they could not be moved - as if he handled with ease those vast masses of matter, with all their rocks and forests - and caused them to repose steadily and calmly on their foundations. We have few more exalted conceptions of the power of God than to suppose him lifting with ease a vast mountain; letting it down where he pleases, and settling it so firmly that it cannot be moved.<p>Being girded with power - That is, they seemed to be surrounded or encompassed with power, as a man girds himself up when he wishes to put forth a great effort of strength. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-13.

In the first creation and formation of them, when they were settled on their basis so firmly that they are rarely removed, and when they are it is something extraordinary. Some understand this of the Lord's preparing the mountains with the rain of his strength, for the bringing forth of herbs and grass for the service of man and beast, and of his adorning them with trees; and the Targum is, <p>"who preparest food for the wild goats of the mountains;'' <p>others interpret them of kingdoms and communities, comparable to mountains, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>; but these are not set fast, they are not firm and stable, but in a course of time are removed, and give way to others; rather the church of God is meant; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; where the same phrase is used as here; and "mountains" may signify particular churches, or indeed particular believers; for all that trust in the Lord are like to mountains, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-1.htm">Psalm 125:1</a>; and these are set fast in the everlasting love of God, by which their mountain is made to stand strong; in eternal election, which is the foundation of God that stands sure; in the covenant of grace, which is more immovable than hills and mountains; and on Christ the Rock, against whom the gates of hell can never prevail; and who are so established, settled, and kept by the power of God, that they cannot be removed by the most boisterous storms and winds of the world's persecutions, Satan's temptations, or their own sins and corruptions; <p>being girded with power: not the mountains, but God himself; whose power, like himself, is infinite, and appears in the works of his hands, of nature, providence, and grace: the allusion is to a mighty man girded for battle; or for the performance of great undertakings. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/65.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/65.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">setteth fast the mountains</span>] The mountains poetically represent the strongest and most solid parts of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm" title="Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.">Psalm 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-2.htm" title="Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the middle of the sea;">Psalm 46:2</a> f).

The mountains are an emblem of God's strength and firmness and fixedness. They stand up in still and silent majesty; they seem as if they could never be moved. He who created them must be girded with power (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/64.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Deep is man's heart and inward part, but not too deep for God, who knoweth the heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>.). And He will just as suddenly surprise the enemies of His anointed with their death-blow, as they had plotted it for him. The futt. consec. that follow represent that which is future, with all the certainty of an historical fact as a retribution springing from the malicious craftiness of the enemies. According to the accentuation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-8.htm">Psalm 64:8</a> is to be rendered: "then will Elohim shoot them, a sudden arrow become their wounds." Thus at length Hupfeld renders it; but how extremely puzzling is the meaning hidden behind this sentence! The Targum and the Jewish expositors have construed it differently: "Then will Elohim shoot them with arrows suddenly;" in this case, however, because <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-8.htm">Psalm 64:8</a> then becomes too blunt and bald, &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1501; has to be repeated in thought with this member of the verse, and this is in itself an objection to it. We interpunctuate with Ewald and Hitzig thus: then does Elohim shoot them with an arrow, suddenly arise (become a reality) their wounds (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>), namely, of those who had on their part aimed the murderous weapon against the upright for a sudden and sure shot. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-9.htm">Psalm 64:9</a> is still more difficult. Kimchi's interpretation, which accords with the accents: et corruere facient eam super se, linguam suam, is intolerable; the proleptic suffix, having reference to &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-20.htm">Job 33:20</a>), ought to have been feminine (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>), and "to make their own tongue fall upon themselves" is an odd fancy. The objective suffix will therefore refer per enallagen to the enemy. But not thus (as Hitzig, who now seeks to get out of the difficulty by an alteration of the text, formerly rendered it): "and they cause those to fall whom they have slandered [lit. upon whom their tongue came]." This form of retribution does not accord with the context; and moreover the gravely earnest &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, like the &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;-, refers more probably to the enemies than to the objects of their hostility. The interpretation of Ewald and Hengstenberg is better: "and one overthrows him, inasmuch as their tongue, i.e., the sin of their tongue with which they sought to destroy others, comes upon themselves." The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>, is the powers which are at the service of God, and which are not mentioned at all; and the thought &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; (a circumstantial clause) is like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a>, where in a similar connection the very same singularly rugged lapidary, or terse, style is found. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-9.htm">Psalm 64:9</a> we must proceed on the assumption that &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489; in such a connection signifies the gratification of looking upon those who are justly punished and rendered harmless. But he who tarries to look upon such a scene is certainly not the person to flee from it; &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491; does not here mean "to betake one's self to flight" (Ewald, Hitzig), but to shake one's self, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-27.htm">Jeremiah 48:27</a>, viz., to shake the head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-15.htm">Psalm 44:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>) - the recognised (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>) gesture of malignant, mocking astonishment. The approbation is awarded, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a>, to God, the just One. And with the joy at His righteous interposition, - viz. of Him who has been called upon to interpose, - is combined a fear of the like punishment. The divine act of judicial retribution now set forth becomes a blessing to mankind. From mouth to mouth it is passed on, and becomes an admonitory nota bene. To the righteous in particular it becomes a consolatory and joyous strengthening of his faith. The judgment of Jahve is the redemption of the righteous. Thus, then, does he rejoice in his God, who by thus judging and redeeming makes history into the history of redemption, and hide himself the more confidingly in Him; and all the upright boast themselves, viz., in God, who looks into the heart and practically acknowledges them whose heart is directed unswervingly towards Him, and conformed entirely to Him. In place of the futt. consec., which have a prophetic reference, simple futt. come in here, and between these a perf. consec. as expressive of that which will then happen when that which is prophetically certain has taken place. </body></html>
