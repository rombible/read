Praise is silent unto thee, as wanting words to express the great goodness of God. He reveals himself upon a mercy-seat, ready to hear and answer the prayers of all who come unto him by faith in Jesus Christ. Our sins prevail against us; we cannot pretend to balance them with any righteousness of our own: yet, as for our transgressions, of thine own free mercy, and for the sake of a righteousness of thine own providing, we shall not come into condemnation for them. Observe what it is to come into communion with God in order to blessedness. It is to converse with him as one we love and value; it is to apply ourselves closely to religion as to the business of our dwelling-place. Observe how we come into communion with God; only by God's free choice. There is abundance of goodness in God's house, and what is satisfying to the soul; there is enough for all, enough for each: it is always ready; and all without money and without price. By faith and prayer we may keep up communion with God, and bring in comfort from him, wherever we are. But it is only through that blessed One, who approaches the Father as our Advocate and Surety, that sinners may expect or can find this happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed is the man whom thou choosest - That is, Happy is the man; or, "Oh, the happiness of the man whom thou dost thus permit to approach thee." The construction here in the Hebrew is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. See the notes at that passage. The word choosest refers to the fact that true piety regards all such blessings as the result of the divine favor; the fruit of his electing grace and love. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-4</a>; notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2-3</a>. We approach God with confidence, with the spirit of true worshippers, with the spirit of his children, only as he inclines us to him, and calls us to partake of his favor. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>.<p>And causest to approach unto thee - That is, that he may worship thee. The idea is here recognized in the word "causest," that it is only by a divine influence that people are led to worship God. The cause - the efficient reason - why any man worships his Maker at all, is to be found in God himself. This idea is fairly implied in the form of the word as it is used in the Hebrew.<p>That he may dwell in thy courts - That is, either temporarily for the purpose of worship; or permanently, that he may serve thee in the sanctuary. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>, note. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>. The word "courts" refers properly to the area around the tabernacle or the temple, and not to the tabernacle or temple itself. The worship of the people was offered in those courts, and not in the tabernacle or temple. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>.<p>We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house - Our souls will find thus what they need; what they long for. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>. It is the nature of religion to satisfy the mind; that is, the soul finds in religion what meets its needs, for religion leaves no necessity of its nature unsupplied. It may be added that nothing else will do this but religion. The word "house" here denotes a place where God dwells, and it might be applied to the temple, as it often is in the Scriptures (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-13.htm">Matthew 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-17.htm">Mark 11:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19.htm">Luke 19</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>; et al.); or to the tabernacle, before the temple was reared. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-31.htm">Judges 20:31</a>. The reference here is to the tabernacle or tent which David reared on Mount Zion, and where the worship of God was celebrated before the temple was built. "Even of thy holy temple." The word "temple" is most commonly applied in the Scriptures to the structure which Solomon built for the worship of God; and it is on the ground that the Word is usually so applied, that DeWette and others have argued that this psalm could not have been written by David, but that it was composed after the temple was reared. But the word rendered "temple" - &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;  he&#770;yka&#770;l - is a word of so general a character that it may be applied to any house erected for the worship of God. It is not unfrequently applied to the tabernacle. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>. This psalm, therefore, may have been composed while the tabernacle was standing, and before the temple was built, and hence, may have been composed by David, as the title intimates. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. dwell in thy courts; &#8230; [and] satisfied with the goodness &#8230; temple&#8212;denote communion with God (Ps 15:1; 23:6; compare Ps 5:7).

The persons whom God has chosen for himself are, in their state of nature, at a distance from him by reason of sin; and through the blood and sacrifice of Christ, by which atonement is made, they are brought nigh to him; and in the faith of Christ the Mediator, their hearts are engaged to approach unto God, and come with boldness to his throne, and ask grace and mercy of him; and through the grace of Christ they have nearness to him, and communion with him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <p>that he may dwell in thy courts; or "he shall dwell" (l); the man that is chosen of God, and brought nigh by Christ; he shall not only come into the house of God, and tread in his courts, but he shall dwell there, ever abide, and never go out; <p>we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house; even all that are like this man, chosen by the grace of God, redeemed by the blood of Christ, brought into the house of God, and have a place and a name there, better than that of sons and daughters of men: by "the house" of God we are to understand the church of God; and by "the goodness" of it the provisions of grace in it, the word and ordinances, and the blessings of grace held forth in them, and especially Christ the bread of life, whose flesh is meat indeed, and whose blood is drink indeed; of which true believers may eat, and do to full satisfaction; and blessed are they that have such food, and appetites for it, and are filled with it.

Here however it is not limited to the sons of Aaron, but applied to all the nation as ‘a kingdom of priests’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>). They are God’s guests in His house, members of the ‘household of God.’ The visit to the Temple was for the devout Israelite a sacrament of his membership in God’s household, and the sacred feasts symbolised the spiritual blessings prepared by God for His people in fellowship with Him.

And causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts. Among the peculiar privileges, one of the greatest was that of approaching God's presence in his holy temple, and entering his "courts" and worshipping there. This all Israelites were not only permitted, but commanded to do, at least three times in the year, while the dwellers in Jerusalem, privileged above the rest, had constant opportunities of attending, and using to the full the means of grace provided for them in the sanctuary. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. In "the goodness of God's house" the psalmist includes, not only the delights there experienced, but also all the blessings which God gives to those who devoutly worship him there - "from the forgiveness of sins to outward, temporal mercies" (Hengstenberg). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/64.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Deep is man's heart and inward part, but not too deep for God, who knoweth the heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>.). And He will just as suddenly surprise the enemies of His anointed with their death-blow, as they had plotted it for him. The futt. consec. that follow represent that which is future, with all the certainty of an historical fact as a retribution springing from the malicious craftiness of the enemies. According to the accentuation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-8.htm">Psalm 64:8</a> is to be rendered: "then will Elohim shoot them, a sudden arrow become their wounds." Thus at length Hupfeld renders it; but how extremely puzzling is the meaning hidden behind this sentence! The Targum and the Jewish expositors have construed it differently: "Then will Elohim shoot them with arrows suddenly;" in this case, however, because <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-8.htm">Psalm 64:8</a> then becomes too blunt and bald, &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1501; has to be repeated in thought with this member of the verse, and this is in itself an objection to it. We interpunctuate with Ewald and Hitzig thus: then does Elohim shoot them with an arrow, suddenly arise (become a reality) their wounds (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>), namely, of those who had on their part aimed the murderous weapon against the upright for a sudden and sure shot. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-9.htm">Psalm 64:9</a> is still more difficult. Kimchi's interpretation, which accords with the accents: et corruere facient eam super se, linguam suam, is intolerable; the proleptic suffix, having reference to &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-20.htm">Job 33:20</a>), ought to have been feminine (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>), and "to make their own tongue fall upon themselves" is an odd fancy. The objective suffix will therefore refer per enallagen to the enemy. But not thus (as Hitzig, who now seeks to get out of the difficulty by an alteration of the text, formerly rendered it): "and they cause those to fall whom they have slandered [lit. upon whom their tongue came]." This form of retribution does not accord with the context; and moreover the gravely earnest &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, like the &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;-, refers more probably to the enemies than to the objects of their hostility. The interpretation of Ewald and Hengstenberg is better: "and one overthrows him, inasmuch as their tongue, i.e., the sin of their tongue with which they sought to destroy others, comes upon themselves." The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>, is the powers which are at the service of God, and which are not mentioned at all; and the thought &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; (a circumstantial clause) is like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a>, where in a similar connection the very same singularly rugged lapidary, or terse, style is found. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-9.htm">Psalm 64:9</a> we must proceed on the assumption that &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489; in such a connection signifies the gratification of looking upon those who are justly punished and rendered harmless. But he who tarries to look upon such a scene is certainly not the person to flee from it; &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491; does not here mean "to betake one's self to flight" (Ewald, Hitzig), but to shake one's self, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-27.htm">Jeremiah 48:27</a>, viz., to shake the head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-15.htm">Psalm 44:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>) - the recognised (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>) gesture of malignant, mocking astonishment. The approbation is awarded, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a>, to God, the just One. And with the joy at His righteous interposition, - viz. of Him who has been called upon to interpose, - is combined a fear of the like punishment. The divine act of judicial retribution now set forth becomes a blessing to mankind. From mouth to mouth it is passed on, and becomes an admonitory nota bene. To the righteous in particular it becomes a consolatory and joyous strengthening of his faith. The judgment of Jahve is the redemption of the righteous. Thus, then, does he rejoice in his God, who by thus judging and redeeming makes history into the history of redemption, and hide himself the more confidingly in Him; and all the upright boast themselves, viz., in God, who looks into the heart and practically acknowledges them whose heart is directed unswervingly towards Him, and conformed entirely to Him. In place of the futt. consec., which have a prophetic reference, simple futt. come in here, and between these a perf. consec. as expressive of that which will then happen when that which is prophetically certain has taken place. </body></html>
