Or rather, at such occurrences as extraordinary thunders, lightnings, and meteors in the air, comets in the heavens, or volcanic eruptions and earthquakes on the earth; all which are the works of God, whatever secondary causes he may use to produce them. As if he had said, The remotest and most barbarous people are struck with the dread of thee, when thou alarmest them with any unusual tokens of thy power. <span class="ital">Thou makest the out goings of the morning and evening to rejoice — </span>The successive courses of the morning and evening, or of the sun and moon, which go forth at those times, the one bringing the light of the morning, and the other the shades of the evening, and both which are said poetically to rejoice, because they give men occasion of rejoicing. For as it is God that scatters the light of the morning, and draws the curtains of the evening, so he does both in favour to man. And how contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, or how inviolable soever the partition between them may be, both are equally welcome to the world in their season. And it is hard to say which is more welcome to us, the light of the morning, which befriends the business of the day, or the shadows of the evening, which befriend the repose of the night. Doth the watchman wait for the morning? So doth the hireling earnestly desire the shadow. Thus, this whole verse speaks of the natural works of God; the former clause of such as are extraordinary and terrible, the latter of such as are ordinary and delightful.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/65.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>65:6-13 That Almighty strength which sets fast the mountains, upholds the believer. That word which stills the stormy ocean, and speaks it into a calm, can silence our enemies. How contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, it is hard to say which is most welcome. Does the watchman wait for the morning? so does the labourer earnestly desire the shades of evening. Some understand it of the morning and evening sacrifices. We are to look upon daily worship, both alone and with our families, to be the most needful of our daily occupations, the most delightful of our daily comforts. How much the fruitfulness of this lower part of the creation depends upon the influence of the upper, is easy to observe; every good and perfect gift is from above. He who enriches the earth, which is filled with man's sins, by his abundant and varied bounty, can neither want power nor will to feed the souls of his people. Temporal mercies to us unworthy creatures, shadow forth more important blessings. The rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring forth of the influences of the Holy Spirit, that river of God, full of the waters of life and salvation, render the hard, barren, worthless hearts of sinners fruitful in every good work, and change the face of nations more than the sun and rain change the face of nature. Wherever the Lord passes, by his preached gospel, attended by his Holy Spirit, his paths drop fatness, and numbers are taught to rejoice in and praise him. They will descend upon the pastures of the wilderness, all the earth shall hear and embrace the gospel, and bring forth abundantly the fruits of righteousness which are, through Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father. Manifold and marvellous, O Lord, are thy works, whether of nature or of grace; surely in loving-kindness hast thou made them all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They also that dwell in the utter-most parts - That is, Those who dwell in the remotest regions; far from civilized lands; far from those places where people are instructed as to the causes of the events which occur, and as to the being and character of the great God who performs these wonders. The idea is, that even they see enough of the evidences of the divine presence and power to fill their minds with awe. In other words, there are in all lands evidences of the Divine existence and might. There is enough to fill the minds of people with awe, and to make them solemn.<p>Are afraid - Thus the thunder, the storm, the tempest, the earthquake, the eclipse of the sun or the moon, fill the minds of barbarous nations with terror.<p>At thy tokens - Or signs. That is, the signs which really indicate the existence, the presence, and the power of God.<p>Thou makest the outgoings - The word rendered outgoings means properly a going forth, as of the rising of the sun <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>; and then, a place of going forth, or from which anything goes forth, as a gate or door <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-11.htm">Ezekiel 42:11</a>, or fountains from which water issues <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>; and hence, the east, where the sun seems to come forth from his hiding-place. The representation here is that the morning seems to come forth, or that the rays of light stream out from the east; and, in like manner, that the fading light of the evening - the twilight - seems to come from the west.<p>Of the morning and evening to rejoice - The allusion is to the east and the west. The sun in his rising and his setting seems to rejoice; that is, he appears happy, bright, cheerful. The margin is to sing - a poetic expression indicating exultation and joy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. outgoings of &#8230; rejoice&#8212;all people from east to west.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/65.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The uttermost parts, </span> to wit, <span class="ital">of the earth</span>, which is added to this word, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm" title="By terrible things in righteousness will you answer us, O God of our salvation; who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off on the sea:">Psalm 65:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy tokens, </span> or <span class="ital">signs</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

So the meaning is, that God gives all the people of the world, from east to west, occasion to rejoice in the effects of his bounty and goodness to them. But if the psalmist had meant this, it is not probable that he would have expressed it in such a dark and doubtful phrase, which is never used in that sense; but rather by those known and usual expressions, <span class="ital">from east to west</span>, or, <span class="ital">from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof</span>, which phrase he useth <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm" title="Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.">Psalm 1:1</a> 113:3</span>. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The successive courses of the morning and evening; or of the sun and moon, which go forth at those times, thereby making the morning and evening; both which are said to rejoice poetically, because they give men occasion of rejoicing, which the sun or the morning doth, because it gives them opportunity for the despatch of business, and for the enjoyment of manifold recreations and delights; and the moon or evening doth so, because it invites men to that rest and sleep which is both refreshing and necessary for them. Thus this whole verse speaks of the natural works of God; the former clause of such as are extraordinary and terrible, the latter of such as are ordinary and delightful. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/65.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens,.... The tokens of his wrath and displeasure at wicked men, seen in the punishments inflicted on them, which cause them to fear and tremble. Some interpret them of the sun, moon, and stars, which are set for "signs", as the word (m) used signifies; and which declare the glory of God to the uttermost parts of the earth, and strike men with awe and reverence of him; and others of thunder and lightning, which are sometimes very dreadful and terrible. Moreover, the word (n) signifies signs and wonders, marvellous things, miraculous operations; and may be understood of those that were wrought in the first times of the Gospel, for the confirmation of it; some of which were wrought in the uttermost parts of the earth; or, however, were heard of there, and believed; which caused them to receive the Gospel with all reverence, not as the word of man, but as the word of God; <p>thou makest the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to rejoice; some interpret this of the morning and evening sacrifices; others of the sun that goes forth in the morning, and rejoices as a strong man to run his race, and of the moon and stars that appear in the evening, and both give pleasure and delight to the inhabitants of the earth; others of men who go forth in the morning cheerfully to their labour, and of the beasts that go out in the evening to seek their prey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>; but it seems better to understand it of the rising of the stars before the sun in the morning, and the appearance of them after the moon is up in the evening; or of the rising and setting sun; of the east and west, which include the whole world, and the inhabitants of it; who are made to rejoice at the coming of the Gospel among them, which rings the good news and glad tidings of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation, by Christ, whereby his name becomes great, and is praised among the Gentiles; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>. <p>(m) "a signis tuis", Pagninus, Montanus, &amp;c.

The lxx renders &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, but &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, tibi par est, h. e. convenit laus (Ewald), is not a usage of the language (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-1.htm">Psalm 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-7.htm">Jeremiah 10:7</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; signifies, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>, silence, and as an ethical notion, resignation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>. According to the position of the words it looks like the subject, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; like the predicate. The accents at least (Illuj, Shalsheleth) assume the relationship of the one word to the other to be that of predicate and subject; consequently it is not: To Thee belongeth resignation, praise (Hengstenberg), but: To Thee is resignation praise, i.e., resignation is (given or presented) to Thee as praise. Hitzig obtains the same meaning by an alteration of the text: &#1500;&#1498; &#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;; but opposed to this is the fact that &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1500; is not found anywhere in the Psalter, but only in the writings of the chronicler. And since it is clear that the words &#1500;&#1498; &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; belong together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>), the poet had no need to fear any ambiguity when he inserted dmyh between them as that which is given to God as praise in Zion. What is intended is that submission or resignation to God which gives up its cause to God and allows Him to act on its behalf, renouncing all impatient meddling and interference (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>). The second member of the sentence affirms that this praise of pious resignation does not remain unanswered. Just as God in Zion is praised by prayer which resigns our own will silently to His, so also to Him are vows paid when He fulfils such prayer. That the answers to prayer are evidently thought of in connection with this, we see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-3.htm">Psalm 65:3</a>, where God is addressed as the "Hearer or Answerer of prayer." To Him as being the Hearer and Answerer of prayer all flesh comes, and in fact, as &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; implies (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>), without finding help anywhere else, it clear a way for itself until it gets to Him; i.e., men, absolutely dependent, impotent in themselves and helpless, both collectively and individually (those only excepted who are determined to perish or despair), flee to Him as their final refuge and help. Before all else it is the prayer for the forgiveness of sin which He graciously answers. The perfect in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a> is followed by the future in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>. The former, in accordance with the sense, forms a hypothetical protasis: granted that the instances of faults have been too powerful for me, i.e., (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-13.htm">Genesis 4:13</a>) an intolerable burden to me, our transgressions are expiated by Thee (who alone canst and also art willing to do it). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is not less significant than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-18.htm">2 Samuel 11:18</a>.: it separates the general fact into its separate instances and circumstances. How blessed therefore is the lot of that man whom (supply &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;) God chooses and brings near, i.e., removes into His vicinity, that he may inhabit His courts (future with the force of a clause expressing a purpose, as e.g., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>, which see), i.e., that there, where He sits enthroned and reveals Himself, he may have his true home and be as if at home (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>)! The congregation gathered around Zion is esteemed worthy of this distinction among the nations of the earth; it therefore encourages itself in the blessed consciousness of this its privilege flowing from free grace (&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;), to enjoy in full draughts (&#1513;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506; with &#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>) the abundant goodness or blessing (&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;) of God's house, of the holy (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) of His temple, i.e., of His holy temple (&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>). For for all that God's grace offers us we can give Him no better thanks than to hunger and thirst after it, and satisfy our poor soul therewith. </body></html>
