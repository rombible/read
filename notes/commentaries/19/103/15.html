The flower of the garden is commonly more choice, and will last the longer, for being sheltered by the garden-wall, and the gardener's care; but the flower of the field, to which life is here compared, is not only withering in itself, but exposed to the cold blasts, and liable to be cropt and trod on by the beasts of the field. Such is man. God considers this, and pities him; let him consider it himself. God's mercy is better than life, for it will outlive it. His righteousness, the truth of his promise, shall be unto children's children, who tread in the footsteps of their forefathers' piety. Then shall mercy be preserved to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As for man - literally, "Man; like the grass are his days!"

From the loving kindness and mercy of God the psalmist passes to the weakness and helplessness of man. Man is like grass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, etc.).

What <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-6.htm">Psalm 103:6</a> says is a common-place drawn from the history of Israel. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; is an accusative governed by the &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; that is to be borrowed out of &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (so Baer after the Masora). And because <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-6.htm">Psalm 103:6</a> is the result of an historical retrospect and survey, &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-7.htm">Psalm 103:7</a> can affirm that which happened in the past (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>.); for the supposition of Hengstenberg and Hitzig, that Moses here represents Israel like Jacob, Isaac, and Joseph in other instances, is without example in the whole Israelitish literature. It becomes clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a> in what sense the making of His ways known is meant. The poet has in his mind Moses' prayer: "make known to me now Thy way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>), which Jahve fulfilled by passing by him as he stood in the cleft of the rock and making Himself visible to him as he looked after Him, amidst the proclamation of His attributes. The ways of Jahve are therefore in this passage not those in which men are to walk in accordance with His precepts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a>), but those which He Himself follows in the course of His redemptive history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-3.htm">Psalm 67:3</a>). The confession drawn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. is become a formula of the Israelitish faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-8.htm">Psalm 145:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>, and frequently). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9</a>. the fourth attribute (&#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;) is made the object of further praise. He is not only long (&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; from &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;) in anger, i.e., waiting a long time before He lets His anger loose, but when He contends, i.e., interposes judicially, this too is not carried to the full extent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a>), He is not angry for ever (&#1504;&#1496;&#1512;, to keep, viz., anger, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; cf. the parallels, both as to matter and words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm">Jeremiah 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-16.htm">Isaiah 57:16</a>). The procedure of His righteousness is regulated not according to our sins, but according to His purpose of mercy. The prefects in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10</a> state that which God has constantly not done, and the futures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9</a> what He continually will not do. </body></html>
