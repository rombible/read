He disposes all persons and things to his own glory. There is a world of holy angels who are ever praising him. Let all his works praise him. Such would have been our constant delight, if we had not been fallen creatures. Such it will in a measure become, if we are born of God. Such it will be for ever in heaven; nor can we be perfectly happy till we can take unwearied pleasure in perfect obedience to the will of our God. And let the feeling of each redeemed heart be, Bless the Lord, O my soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts - His armies; the vast multitudes of holy beings, arranged and marshalled as hosts for battle, in all parts of the universe. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>; notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>.<p>Ye ministers of his - The same beings referred to by the word "hosts," and all others who may be employed in executing his will. The "hosts" or armies of the Lord are thus marshalled that they may "do his pleasure," or that they may execute his purposes.<p>That do his pleasure - What is agreeable to him; that is, who perform his will. Employed in his service, and appointed to execute his will, they are called on to bless his name. The fact of being employed in his service is a sufficient reason for praise. It is implied here that those "ministers of his" actually do his will. They are obedient to his commands; they regard themselves as employed for him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/103.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. ye his hosts&#8212;myriads, or armies, as corresponding to angels of great power [Ps 103:20], denoting multitudes also.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All ye his hosts; </span> ye angels; to whom he still continues his address, and whom he more particularly describes by the name of hosts, a title oft given to the angels, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm" title="And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.">Genesis 32:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1 Kings 22:19</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-18.htm" title="Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.">2 Chronicles 18:18</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm" title="And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,">Luke 2:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-14.htm" title="And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.">Revelation 19:14</a></span>, in regard of their vast numbers, mighty power, unanimous concurrence, and exquisite order.

Or rather, since these seem to be distinguished from the angels before addressed, by them may be meant the church militant and her members; who are like an army with banners, consisting of volunteer soldiers under Christ, the Captain of their salvation; whose battles they fight against sin, Satan, and the world; and have a great deal of reason to bless and praise the Lord, for all the great and good things he has done to them, and for them. <p>Ye ministers of his that do his pleasure; so the angels are called, and they do the will of God; what is acceptable to him, and well pleasing in his sight, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-16.htm">Psalm 103:16</a> &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>.) refers to man, who is compared to grass and flowers. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; with a hypothetical perfect; and the wind that scorches up the plants, referred to man, is an emblem of every form of peril that threatens life: often enough it is really a breath of wind which snaps off a man's life. The bold designation of vanishing away without leaving any trace, "and his place knoweth him no more," is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-10.htm">Job 7:10</a>, cf. ibid. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-18.htm">Job 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-9.htm">Job 20:9</a>. In the midst of this plant-like, frail destiny, there is, however, one strong ground of comfort. There is an everlasting power, which raises all those who link themselves with it above the transitoriness involved in nature's laws, and makes them eternal like itself. This power is the mercy of God, which spans itself above (&#1506;&#1500;) all those who fear Him like an eternal heaven. This is God's righteousness, which rewards faithful adherence to His covenant and conscientious fulfilment of His precepts in accordance with the order of redemption, and shows itself even to (&#1500;) children's children, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a> : on into a thousand generations, i.e., into infinity. </body></html>
