Thus, in these three verses, “we are presented with three of the most beautiful, apposite, and comforting similitudes in the world. When we lift up our eyes, and behold around us the lofty and stupendous vault of heaven, encircling, protecting, enlightening, refreshing, and cherishing the earth, and all things which are therein, we are bidden to contemplate, in this glass, the immeasurable height, the boundless extent, and the salutary influences of that mercy which, as it were, embraced the creation, and is over all the works of God. Often as we view the sun arising in the sea, and darkness flying away before his face toward the opposite quarter of the heavens, we may see an image of that goodness of Jehovah, whereby we are placed in the regions of illumination, and our sins are removed, and put far away out of his sight. And, that our hearts may, at all times, have confidence toward God, he is represented as bearing toward us the fond and tender affection of a <span class="ital">father, </span>ever ready to defend, to nourish, and to provide for us, to bear with us, to forgive us, and receive us in the paternal arms of everlasting love.” — Horne. “One would think it impossible,” says another eminent divine, “if daily experience did not convince us to the contrary, that human creatures should be regardless of such love, and ungrateful to so solicitous a benefactor! For my own part, I cannot conceive it possible for any heart to be unaffected or uninfluenced by such a composition as this before us.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>103:6-14 Truly God is good to all: he is in a special manner good to Israel. He has revealed himself and his grace to them. By his ways we may understand his precepts, the ways he requires us to walk in; and his promises and purposes. He always has been full of compassion. How unlike are those to God, who take every occasion to chide, and never know when to cease! What would become of us, if God should deal so with us? The Scripture says a great deal of the mercy of God, and we all have experienced it. The father pities his children that are weak in knowledge, and teaches them; pities them when they are froward, and bears with them; pities them when they are sick, and comforts them; pities them when they are fallen, and helps them to rise; pities them when they have offended, and, upon their submission, forgives them; pities them when wronged, and rights them: thus the Lord pities those that fear him. See why he pities. He considers the frailty of our bodies, and the folly of our souls, how little we can do, how little we can bear; in all which his compassion appears.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For as the heaven is high above the earth - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-10.htm">Psalm 57:10</a>. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-9.htm">Isaiah 55:9</a>. The literal translation of the phrase here would be, "For like the height of the heavens above the earth." The heavens - the starry heavens - are the highest objects of which we have any knowledge; and hence, the comparison is used to denote the great mercy of God - meaning that it is as great as can be conceived; that there is nothing beyond it; that we cannot imagine that it could be greater - as we can imagine nothing higher than the heavens.<p>So great is his mercy toward them that fear him - To those who reverence and serve him. That is, His mercy is thus great in forgiving their offences; in imparting grace; in giving them support and consolation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/103.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. great&#8212;efficient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So much above their deserts and expectations, and above the mercy which one man showeth to another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Toward them that fear them; </span> which clause he adds here, as also <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-17.htm" title="But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on them that fear him, and his righteousness to children's children;">Psalm 103:17</a>,18</span>, to prevent men’s mistakes and abuses of God’s mercy, and to dash the vain hopes of impenitent sinners in God’s mercy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/103.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For as the heaven is high above the earth,....

In such soliloquies it is the Ego that speaks, gathering itself up with the spirit, the stronger, more manly part of man (Psychology, S. 104f.; tr. p. 126), or even, because the soul as the spiritual medium of the spirit and of the body represents the whole person of man (Psychology, S. 203; tr. p. 240), the Ego rendering objective in the soul the whole of its own personality. So here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a> the soul, which is addressed, represents the whole man. The &#1511;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; which occurs here is a more choice expression for &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;): the heart, which is called &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, the reins, the liver, etc.; for according to the scriptural conception (Psychology, S. 266; tr. p. 313) these organs of the cavities of the breast and abdomen serve not merely for the bodily life, but also the psycho-spiritual life. The summoning &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; is repeated per anaphoram. There is nothing the soul of man is so prone to forget as to render thanks that are due, and more especially thanks that are due to God. It therefore needs to be expressly aroused in order that it may not leave the blessing with which God blesses it unacknowledged, and may not forget all His acts performed (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;) on it (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>), which are purely deeds of loving-kindness), which is the primal condition and the foundation of all the others, viz., sin-pardoning mercy. The verbs &#1505;&#1500;&#1495; and &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; with a dative of the object denote the bestowment of that which is expressed by the verbal notion. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-21.htm">Deuteronomy 29:21</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-19.htm">1 Chronicles 21:19</a>, from &#1495;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, root &#1492;&#1500;, solutum, laxum esse) are not merely bodily diseases, but all kinds of inward and outward sufferings. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; the lxx renders &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>); but in this antithesis to life it is more natural to render the "pit" (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;) as a name of Hades, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>. Just as the soul owes its deliverance from guilt and distress and death to God, so also does it owe to God that with which it is endowed out of the riches of divine love. The verb &#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;, without any such addition as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/5-13.htm">Psalm 5:13</a>, is "to crown," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>. As is usually the case, it is construed with a double accusative; the crown is as it were woven out of loving-kindness and compassion. The Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a> instead of the accusative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-28.htm">Psalm 104:28</a>) denotes the means of satisfaction, which is at the same time that which satisfies. &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; the Targum renders: dies senectutis tuae, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a> it is ornatus ejus; the Peshto renders: corpus tuum, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a> inversely, juventus eorum. These significations, "old age" or "youth," are pure inventions. And since the words are addressed to the soul, &#1506;&#1491;&#1497; cannot also, like &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; in other instances, be a name of the soul itself (Aben-Ezra, Mendelssohn, Philippsohn, Hengstenberg, and others). We, therefore, with Hitzig, fall back upon the sense of the word in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a>, where the lxx renders &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, but here more freely, apparently starting from the primary notion of &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;  equals  Arabic chadd, the cheek: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (whereas Saadia's victum tuum is based upon a comparison of the Arabic gda&#770;, to nourish). The poet tells the soul (i.e., his own person, himself) that God satisfies it with good, so that it as it were gets its cheeks full of it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-11.htm">Psalm 81:11</a>). The comparison &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>), to be referred to the annual moulting of the eagle. Its renewing of its plumage is an emblem of the renovation of his youth by grace. The predicate to &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497; (plural of extension in relation to time) stands first regularly in the sing. fem. </body></html>
