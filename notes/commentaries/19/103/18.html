The flower of the garden is commonly more choice, and will last the longer, for being sheltered by the garden-wall, and the gardener's care; but the flower of the field, to which life is here compared, is not only withering in itself, but exposed to the cold blasts, and liable to be cropt and trod on by the beasts of the field. Such is man. God considers this, and pities him; let him consider it himself. God's mercy is better than life, for it will outlive it. His righteousness, the truth of his promise, shall be unto children's children, who tread in the footsteps of their forefathers' piety. Then shall mercy be preserved to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To such as keep his covenant - To such as adhere to the arrangements of his covenant, or who are faithful on their part. God will be faithful to his part of the covenant; and where there is fidelity on the part of his people, the blessings implied in the covenant will be conferred on them and on their children. The promise is ample, and the fidelity of God is certain, but still it is true that in those promises, and in that fidelity, it is implied that his people on their part must be faithful also, or the blessings will not be bestowed. There are no promises of blessings to the unfaithful, nor have those who are unfaithful any reason to hope that they or theirs will be partakers of the blessings of the covenant of mercy. Our only hope that we or our children will be partakers of the blessings of the covenant is to be found in the fact that we ourselves are faithful to God.<p>And to those that remember his commandments to do them - Who do not "forget" his law. If they do forget it, they have no right to expect the blessing. Obedience and fidelity are our only reasonable grounds of expectation of the blessing of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/103.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. such &#8230; covenant&#8212;limits the general terms preceding.<p>righteousness&#8212;as usual (Ps 7:17; 31:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To such as keep his covenant; </span> to them that perform the condition of God’s covenant, that sincerely love and obey him.

The covenant of grace, which is peculiarly the Lord's covenant, as distinct from man's; and which he keeps himself, and is ever mindful of it. This he makes known to his people at conversion; his secret is with them, and he shows them his covenant; the blessings and promises of it; their interest in them, and in himself, as their covenant God: which they "observe" (c), as the word here used signifies; and observing it, they lay hold upon it by faith, as belonging to them; and laying hold upon it, they "keep" it as their own, and keep it fast, and will not part with their interest in it for all the world. <p>And to those that remember his commandments to do them; some read them and hear them, but forget them, at least to do them: these are like a man that beholds his face in a glass, and forgets what manner of man he is; so James compares one that is a forgetful hearer, and not a doer of the word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23</a>. The commandments of God are best remembered, so as to be done, when he puts his laws into the minds of men, and writes them in their hearts, and puts his Spirit within them, to cause them to walk in his statutes, and do them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>. <p>(c) "observantes", Junius &amp; Tremellius; so Piscator, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/103.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To such as keep his <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</span><p>(l) To whom he gives grace to fear him, and to obey his word.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/103.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">his commandments</span>] R.V. his precepts.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/103.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To such as keep his covenant;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to the faithful" - to those who, notwithstanding many lapses and many shortcomings, are yet sincere in heart, and seek to do his will.

(cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-11.htm">Psalm 57:11</a>) illustrate the infinite power and complete unreservedness of mercy (loving-kindness). &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511; has Gaja (as have also &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; and &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/53-2.htm">Psalm 53:2</a>, in exact texts), in order to render possible the distinct pronunciation of the guttural in the combination &#1512;&#1495;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a> sounds just as much like the spirit of the New Testament as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-11.htm">Psalm 103:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>. The relationship to Jahve in which those stand who fear Him is a filial relationship based upon free reciprocity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-11.htm">Malachi 3:11</a>). His Fatherly compassion is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>) based upon the frailty and perishableness of man, which are known to God, much the same as God's promise after the Flood not to decree a like judgment again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>). According to this passage and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-21.htm">Deuteronomy 31:21</a>, &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; appears to be intended of the moral nature; but according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>, one is obliged to think rather of the natural form which man possesses from God the Creator (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1510;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) than of the form of heart which he has by his own choice and, so far as its groundwork is concerned, by inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>). In &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, mindful, the passive, according to B&#1510;ttcher's correct apprehension of it, expresses a passive state after an action that is completed by the person himself, as in &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, and the like. In its form <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a> reminds one of the Book of Job J<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/11-11.htm">Obadiah 11:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-23.htm">Job 28:23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a> as to subject-matter recalls <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>, and other passages (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-39.htm">Psalm 78:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-48.htm">Psalm 89:48</a>); but the following figurative representation of human frailty, with which the poet contrasts the eternal nature of the divine mercy as the sure stay of all God-fearing ones in the midst of the rise and decay of things here below, still more strongly recalls that book. </body></html>
