This is the ground of the security that his blessing will be imparted to those who fear him, and to their children's children, or that it will be transmitted to coming generations. God is a Sovereign. His throne is fixed and firm. His dominion is not vacillating and changing. His reign is not, like the reign of earthly monarchs, dependent on the capriciousness of a changeable will, or on passion; nor is it liable to be altered by death, by revolution, or a new dynasty. The throne of God is ever the same, and nothing can shake or overthrow it. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>.<p>And his kingdom ruleth over all - He reigns over all the universe - the heavens and the earth; and he can, therefore, execute all his purposes.

The heaven is his throne; here he sits enthroned in all the glory of his majesty, with all his attendants upon him, and courtiers about him. The Lord Christ is now in heaven; and where he will continue to the restitution of all things, and from whence his people expect him at the last day. Here he is on the same throne with his divine Father; which throne he has "prepared" or "established" (d), so as it cannot be moved: when others are cast down, this shall stand; his throne is for ever and ever. The Targum in the king's Bible is, <p>"the Word of the Lord hath prepared, &amp;c.'' <p>And his kingdom ruleth over all; over all created beings; over angels, good and bad; over men, righteous and wicked; over the greatest of men, the kings and princes of the earth. Good angels are subject to him devils tremble at him; saints acknowledge him as their King; the wicked he rules with a rod of iron; and kings reign by him, and are accountable to him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>. <p>(d) "stabilivit", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/103.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/103.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>.

The relationship to Jahve in which those stand who fear Him is a filial relationship based upon free reciprocity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-11.htm">Malachi 3:11</a>). His Fatherly compassion is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>) based upon the frailty and perishableness of man, which are known to God, much the same as God's promise after the Flood not to decree a like judgment again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>). According to this passage and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-21.htm">Deuteronomy 31:21</a>, &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; appears to be intended of the moral nature; but according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>, one is obliged to think rather of the natural form which man possesses from God the Creator (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1510;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) than of the form of heart which he has by his own choice and, so far as its groundwork is concerned, by inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>). In &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, mindful, the passive, according to B&#1510;ttcher's correct apprehension of it, expresses a passive state after an action that is completed by the person himself, as in &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, and the like. In its form <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a> reminds one of the Book of Job J<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/11-11.htm">Obadiah 11:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-23.htm">Job 28:23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a> as to subject-matter recalls <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>, and other passages (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-39.htm">Psalm 78:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-48.htm">Psalm 89:48</a>); but the following figurative representation of human frailty, with which the poet contrasts the eternal nature of the divine mercy as the sure stay of all God-fearing ones in the midst of the rise and decay of things here below, still more strongly recalls that book. </body></html>
