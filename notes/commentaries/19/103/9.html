He has revealed himself and his grace to them. By his ways we may understand his precepts, the ways he requires us to walk in; and his promises and purposes. He always has been full of compassion. How unlike are those to God, who take every occasion to chide, and never know when to cease! What would become of us, if God should deal so with us? The Scripture says a great deal of the mercy of God, and we all have experienced it. The father pities his children that are weak in knowledge, and teaches them; pities them when they are froward, and bears with them; pities them when they are sick, and comforts them; pities them when they are fallen, and helps them to rise; pities them when they have offended, and, upon their submission, forgives them; pities them when wronged, and rights them: thus the Lord pities those that fear him. See why he pities. He considers the frailty of our bodies, and the folly of our souls, how little we can do, how little we can bear; in all which his compassion appears.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He will not always chide - Rebuke; contend; strive; for so the Hebrew word means. He will not always contend with people, or manifest his displeasure. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-16.htm">Isaiah 57:16</a>; notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38-39</a>. This implies that he may chide or rebuke his people, but that this will not be forever. He will punish them; he will manifest his displeasure at their sins; he will show that he does not approve of their course, but he will show that he "loves them," and does not seek their ruin.<p>Neither will he keep his anger for ever - The words "his anger" are supplied by the translators, but not improperly. The meaning is the same as in the former member of the sentence. He will not cherish hatred when the object of the chastisement is accomplished. It is not his character to retain anger for its own sake, or for any personal gratification. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/103.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-10.

In such soliloquies it is the Ego that speaks, gathering itself up with the spirit, the stronger, more manly part of man (Psychology, S. 104f.; tr. p. 126), or even, because the soul as the spiritual medium of the spirit and of the body represents the whole person of man (Psychology, S. 203; tr. p. 240), the Ego rendering objective in the soul the whole of its own personality. So here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a> the soul, which is addressed, represents the whole man. The &#1511;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; which occurs here is a more choice expression for &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;): the heart, which is called &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, the reins, the liver, etc.; for according to the scriptural conception (Psychology, S. 266; tr. p. 313) these organs of the cavities of the breast and abdomen serve not merely for the bodily life, but also the psycho-spiritual life. The summoning &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; is repeated per anaphoram. There is nothing the soul of man is so prone to forget as to render thanks that are due, and more especially thanks that are due to God. It therefore needs to be expressly aroused in order that it may not leave the blessing with which God blesses it unacknowledged, and may not forget all His acts performed (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;) on it (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>), which are purely deeds of loving-kindness), which is the primal condition and the foundation of all the others, viz., sin-pardoning mercy. The verbs &#1505;&#1500;&#1495; and &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; with a dative of the object denote the bestowment of that which is expressed by the verbal notion. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-21.htm">Deuteronomy 29:21</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-19.htm">1 Chronicles 21:19</a>, from &#1495;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, root &#1492;&#1500;, solutum, laxum esse) are not merely bodily diseases, but all kinds of inward and outward sufferings. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; the lxx renders &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>); but in this antithesis to life it is more natural to render the "pit" (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;) as a name of Hades, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>. Just as the soul owes its deliverance from guilt and distress and death to God, so also does it owe to God that with which it is endowed out of the riches of divine love. The verb &#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;, without any such addition as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/5-13.htm">Psalm 5:13</a>, is "to crown," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>. As is usually the case, it is construed with a double accusative; the crown is as it were woven out of loving-kindness and compassion. The Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a> instead of the accusative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-28.htm">Psalm 104:28</a>) denotes the means of satisfaction, which is at the same time that which satisfies. &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; the Targum renders: dies senectutis tuae, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a> it is ornatus ejus; the Peshto renders: corpus tuum, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a> inversely, juventus eorum. These significations, "old age" or "youth," are pure inventions. And since the words are addressed to the soul, &#1506;&#1491;&#1497; cannot also, like &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; in other instances, be a name of the soul itself (Aben-Ezra, Mendelssohn, Philippsohn, Hengstenberg, and others). We, therefore, with Hitzig, fall back upon the sense of the word in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a>, where the lxx renders &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, but here more freely, apparently starting from the primary notion of &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;  equals  Arabic chadd, the cheek: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (whereas Saadia's victum tuum is based upon a comparison of the Arabic gda&#770;, to nourish). The poet tells the soul (i.e., his own person, himself) that God satisfies it with good, so that it as it were gets its cheeks full of it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-11.htm">Psalm 81:11</a>). The comparison &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>), to be referred to the annual moulting of the eagle. Its renewing of its plumage is an emblem of the renovation of his youth by grace. The predicate to &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497; (plural of extension in relation to time) stands first regularly in the sing. fem. </body></html>
