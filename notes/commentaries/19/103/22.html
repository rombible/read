He disposes all persons and things to his own glory. There is a world of holy angels who are ever praising him. Let all his works praise him. Such would have been our constant delight, if we had not been fallen creatures. Such it will in a measure become, if we are born of God. Such it will be for ever in heaven; nor can we be perfectly happy till we can take unwearied pleasure in perfect obedience to the will of our God. And let the feeling of each redeemed heart be, Bless the Lord, O my soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bless the Lord, all his works - All that he has made, animate and inanimate, intelligent and brute. It is not uncommon to call on the inanimate creation to join with intelligent beings in praising God. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1-14</a>. The same thing is often found in the "Paradise Lost," and in fact occurs in all poetry.<p>In all places of his dominion - Wherever he reigns, on earth, or in heaven; here or in distant worlds.<p>Bless the Lord, O my soul - Ending the psalm as it began, and with the additional reason derived from the fact that the "universe" is called on to do it. As one of the creatures of God; as a part of that vast universe, the psalmist now calls on his own soul to unite with all others - to be one of them - in praising and blessing the Creator. He "desired" thus to unite with all others. His heart was full; and in a universe thus joyous - thus vocal with praise - he wished to be one among the immense multitudes that lifted their voices in adoration of the great Yahweh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/103.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. all his works&#8212;creatures of every sort, everywhere.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All his works in all places of his dominion; </span> all creatures, both in heaven and earth, according to your several capacities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Bless the Lord, O my soul; </span> which thou hast special and abundant reason to do.

Or rather regenerate persons, his sons and daughters, the work of his hand, in each of the parts of the world where they live, are here called upon to bless the Lord; who, of his abundant mercy, hath begotten them again to a glorious inheritance: these are his workmanship in Christ; formed for himself, his service, and glory; and are under the highest obligations to show forth his praise. <p>Bless the Lord, O my soul: thus the psalmist ends the psalm as he begun it; not excusing himself by what he had done, nor by calling upon others to this service; knowing that this is constant employment for time and eternity; a work in which he delighted, and was desirous of being concerned in, now and for ever. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/103.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/103.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>.

The "works of God" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his material universe - cannot, of course, he said to "bless" God in the same sense that men and angels do; but, in a language of their own, they set forth his glory, and to the poetic mind seem truly to sing his praise. The "Song of the Three Children" is a natural outburst from devout hearts. <span class="cmt_word">Bless the Lord, O my soul</span> (comp. ver. 1, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>).  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/103.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The figure of the grass recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>., cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>; that of the flower, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>. &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is man as a mortal being; his life's duration is likened to that of a blade of grass, and his beauty and glory to a flower of the field, whose fullest bloom is also the beginning of its fading. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-16.htm">Psalm 103:16</a> &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>.) refers to man, who is compared to grass and flowers. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; with a hypothetical perfect; and the wind that scorches up the plants, referred to man, is an emblem of every form of peril that threatens life: often enough it is really a breath of wind which snaps off a man's life. The bold designation of vanishing away without leaving any trace, "and his place knoweth him no more," is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-10.htm">Job 7:10</a>, cf. ibid. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-18.htm">Job 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-9.htm">Job 20:9</a>. In the midst of this plant-like, frail destiny, there is, however, one strong ground of comfort. There is an everlasting power, which raises all those who link themselves with it above the transitoriness involved in nature's laws, and makes them eternal like itself. This power is the mercy of God, which spans itself above (&#1506;&#1500;) all those who fear Him like an eternal heaven. This is God's righteousness, which rewards faithful adherence to His covenant and conscientious fulfilment of His precepts in accordance with the order of redemption, and shows itself even to (&#1500;) children's children, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a> : on into a thousand generations, i.e., into infinity. </body></html>
