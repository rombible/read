Think of the provocation; it was sin, and yet pardoned: how many the provocations, yet all pardoned! God is still forgiving, as we are still sinning and repenting. The body finds the melancholy consequences of Adam's offence, it is subject to many infirmities, and the soul also. Christ alone forgives all our sins; it is he alone who heals all our infirmities. And the person who finds his sin cured, has a well-grounded assurance that it is forgiven. When God, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, recovers his people from their decays, and fills them with new life and joy, which is to them an earnest of eternal life and joy, they may then be said to return to the days of their youth, Job 33:25.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bless the Lord, O my soul - The repetition here denotes the intensity or earnestness of the wish or desire of the psalmist. It is an emphatic calling upon his soul, that is, himself, never to forget the many favors which God was continually conferring upon him.<p>And forget not all his benefits - Any of his favors. This refers not to those favors in the aggregate, but it is a call to remember them in particular. The word rendered "benefits" - &#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;  gemu&#770;l - means properly an act, work, doing, whether good or evil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>; and then, "desert," or what a man deserves "for" his act; "recompence." It is rendered "deserving" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-16.htm">Judges 9:16</a>; benefit, as here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-25.htm">2 Chronicles 32:25</a>; "desert," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-4.htm">Psalm 28:4</a>; "reward," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-2.htm">Psalm 94:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-11.htm">Isaiah 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>; "recompence," <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-4.htm">Isaiah 35:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-6.htm">Isaiah 66:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-64.htm">Lamentations 3:64</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-7.htm">Joel 3:7</a>. The proper reference here is to the divine "dealings," - to what God had done - as a reason for blessing his name. His "dealings" with the psalmist had been such as to call for praise and gratitude. What those "dealings" particularly were he specifies in the following verses. The call here on his soul is not to forget these divine dealings, as laying the foundation for praise. We shall find, when we reach the end of life, that all which God has done, however dark and mysterious it may have appeared at the time, was so connected with our good as to make it a proper subject of praise and thanksgiving. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/103.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. forget not all&#8212;not any, none of His benefits.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/103.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Bless the Lord, O my soul,.... Which is repeated to show the importance of the service, and the vehement desire of the psalmist, that his soul should be engaged in it: <p>and forget not all his benefits; not any of them; the least of them are not to be forgotten, being such as men are altogether unworthy of; they flow not from the merit of men, but from the mercy of God; and they are many, even innumerable; they are new every morning, and continue all the day; and how great must the sum of them be, and not one should be forgotten; and yet even good men are very apt to forget them; as the Israelites of old, who sung the praises of the Lord, and soon forgot his works: the Lord, knowing the weakness of his people's memories, has not only, under the Gospel dispensation, appointed an ordinance, to be continued to the end of the world, to commemorate a principal blessing and benefit of his, redemption by his Son; but has also promised his Spirit, to bring all things to their remembrance; and this they should be concerned for, that they do remember what God has done for them, in order both to show gratitude and thankfulness to him, and for the encouragement of their faith and hope in him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/103.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/103.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">forget not</span>] “Beware lest thou forget” is the often repeated warning of Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-12.htm" title="Then beware lest you forget the LORD, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-11.htm" title="Beware that you forget not the LORD your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command you this day:">Deuteronomy 8:11</a>; &c.). “Si oblivisceris tacebis” is St Augustine’s comment.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/103.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bless the Lord, O my soul.</span> Repetition, in Holy Scripture, is almost always for the sake of emphasis.

He has shortened his days, so that he only drags on wearily, and has only a short distance still before him before he is entirely overcome. The Chethb &#1499;&#1495;&#1493; (lxx &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;) may be understood of God's irresistible might, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-6.htm">Job 23:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18</a>, but in connection with it the designation of the object is felt to be wanting. The introductory &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>), which announces a definite moulding of the utterance, serves to give prominence to the petition that follows. In the expression &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; life is conceived of as a line the length of which accords with nature; to die before one's time is a being taken up out of this course, so that the second half of the line is not lived through (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-24.htm">Psalm 55:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>). The prayer not to sweep him away before his time, the poet supports not by the eternity of God in itself, but by the work of the rejuvenation of the world and of the restoration of Israel that is to be looked for, which He can and will bring to an accomplishment, because He is the ever-living One. The longing to see this new time is the final ground of the poet's prayer for the prolonging of his life. The confession of God the Creator in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a> reminds one in its form of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a> refers to the two great divisions of the universe. The fact that God will create heaven and earth anew is a revelation that is indicated even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>, but is first of all expressed more fully and in many ways in the second part of the Book of Isaiah, viz., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>. It is clear from the agreement in the figure of the garment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-9.htm">Psalm 50:9</a>) and in the expression (&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, perstare, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>) that the poet has gained this knowledge from the prophet. The expressive &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, Thou art He, i.e., unalterably the same One, is also taken from the mouth of the prophet, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-4.htm">Isaiah 46:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a>; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is a predicate, and denotes the identity (sameness) of Jahve (Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i. 63). In v. 29 also, in which the prayer for a lengthening of life tapers off to a point, we hear <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a> re-echoed. And from the fact that in the mind of the poet as of the prophet the post-exilic Jerusalem and the final new Jerusalem upon the new earth under a new heaven blend together, it is evident that not merely in the time of Hezekiah or of Manasseh (assuming that <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> are by the old Isaiah), but also even in the second half of the Exile, such a perspectively foreshortened view was possible. When, moreover, the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews at once refers <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26-28</a> to Christ, this is justified by the fact that the God whom the poet confesses as the unchangeable One is Jahve who is to come. </body></html>
