When we see our mistake, it becomes us to think with shame upon our carnal security as our folly. If God hide his face, a good man is troubled, though no other calamity befal him. But if God, in wisdom and justice, turn from us, it will be the greatest folly if we turn from him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark. The sanctified spirit, which returns to God, shall praise him, shall be still praising him; but the services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust; it cannot praise him; there is none of that device or working in the grave, for it is the land of silence. We ask aright for life, when we do so that we may live to praise him. In due time God delivered the psalmist out of his troubles. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when employed in praising God. He would persevere to the end in praise, hoping that he should shortly be where this would be the everlasting work. But let all beware of carnal security. Neither outward prosperity, nor inward peace, here, are sure and lasting. The Lord, in his favour, has fixed the believer's safety firm as the deep-rooted mountains, but he must expect to meet with temptations and afflictions. When we grow careless, we fall into sin, the Lord hides his face, our comforts droop, and troubles assail us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I cried to thee, O Lord - That is, when those reverses came, and when that on which I had so confidently relied was taken away, I called upon the Lord; I uttered an earnest cry for aid. The prayer which he uttered on the occasion is specified in the following verses. The idea here is, that he was not driven from God by these reverses, but TO him. He felt that his reliance on those things in which he had put his trust was vain, and he now came to God, the true Source of strength, and sought His protection and favor. This was doubtless the design of the reverses which God had brought upon him; and this will always be the effect of the reverses that come upon good men. When they have placed undue reliance upon wealth, or health, or friends, and when these are taken away, the effect will be to lead them to God in earnest prayer. God designs to bring them back, and they do come back to him. Afflictions are always, sooner or later, effectual in bringing good men back to God. The sinner is often driven from God by trial; the good man is brought back to find his strength and comfort in God. The one complains, and murmurs, and is wretched; the other prays, and submits, and is made more happy than he was in the days of his prosperity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-11. As in Ps 6:5; 88:10; Isa 38:18, the appeal for mercy is based on the destruction of his agency in praising God here, which death would produce. The terms expressing relief are poetical, and not to be pressed, though "dancing" is the translation of a word which means a lute, whose cheerful notes are contrasted with mourning, or (Am 5:16) wailing.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/30.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>8 I cried to thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication.<p>9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?

Prayer is the unfailing resource of God's people. If they are driven to their wits' end, they may still go to the mercy-seat. When an earthquake makes our mountain tremble, the throne of grace still stands firm, and we may come to it. Let us never forget to pray, and let us never doubt the success of prayer. The hand which wounds can heal: let us turn to him who smites us, and he will be entreated of us. Prayer is better solace than Cain's building a city, or Saul's seeking for music. Mirth and carnal amusements are a sorry prescription for a mind distracted and despairing: prayer will succeed where all else fails.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a><p>In this verse we learn the form and method of David's prayer. It was an argument with God, an urging of reasons, a pleading of his cause. It was not a statement of doctrinal opinions, nor a narration of experience, much less a sly hit at other people under pretence of praying to God, although all these things and worse have been substituted for holy supplication at certain prayer-meetings. He wrestled with the angel of the covenant with vehement pleadings, and therefore he prevailed. Head and heart, judgment and affections, memory and intellect were all at work to spread the case aright before the Lord of love. "What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?" Wilt thou not lose a songster from thy choir, and one who loves to magnify thee? "Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?" Will there not be one witness the less to thy faithfulness and veracity? Spare, then, thy poor unworthy one for thine own name sake!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a><p>"Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me." A short and comprehensive petition, available at all seasons, let us use it full often. It is the publican's prayer; be it ours. If God hears prayer, it is a great act of mercy; our petitions do not merit a reply. "Lord, be thou my helper." Another compact, expressive, ever fitting prayer. It is suitable to hundreds of the cases of the Lord's people; it is well becoming in the minister when he is going to preach, to the sufferer upon the bed of pain, to the toiler in the field of service, to the believer under temptation, to the man of God under adversity; when God helps, difficulties vanish. He is the help of his people, a very present help in trouble. The two brief petitions of this verse are commended as ejaculations to believers full of business, denied to those longer seasons of devotion which are the rare privilege of those whose days are spent in retirement. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I cried to thee, O Lord,.... In his trouble, when the Lord had hid his face from him, and he was sensible that he had departed from him: he was not stupid and unaffected with it; nor did he turn his back upon God, and seek to others; but he cried after a departing God, which showed love to him, and some degree of faith in him, by looking again towards his holy temple, and waiting upon him until he returned; <p>and unto the Lord I made supplication; in the most humble manner; entreating his grace and mercy, and that he would again show him his face and favour. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. The tense in the original is inadequately represented by a simple perfect, though its precise force is not easy to define. It may express the frequent repetition of the prayer, or, like a historic present, it may set the action vividly before us as in actual progress (App., Note IV); or possibly throwing himself back into the past, the Psalmist gives the words of his resolution: [I said,] <span class="ital">Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I call</span> (= <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm" title="To you will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if you be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.">Psalm 28:1</a>); <span class="ital">yea, unto the Lord</span> (the best attested reading is <span class="ital">Adonai</span>) <span class="ital">will I make supplication</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-1.htm" title="I cried to the LORD with my voice; with my voice to the LORD did I make my supplication.">Psalm 142:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8–10</span>.

The part of his prayer most honourable to David is not recorded by himself, but by the historians. He tells us of his secret wrestlings with God, his complaints and expostulations - his cries and pleadings as they remained in his memory; he passes over the desire to die for his people, which the historians put on record. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 30:2-4) The Psalm begins like a hymn. The Piel &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (from &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, Arab. dla&#770;, to hold anything long, loose and pendulous, whether upwards or downwards, conj. V Arab. tdlla&#770; equals , to dangle) signifies to lift or draw up, like a bucket (&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Latin tollo, tolleno in Festus). The poet himself says what that depth is into which he had sunk and out of which God had drawn him up without his enemies rejoicing over him (&#1500;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a>), i.e., without allowing them the wished for joy at his destruction: he was brought down almost into Hades in consequence of some fatal sickness. &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (never: to call into being out of nothing) always means to restore to life that which has apparently or really succumbed to death, or to preserve anything living in life. With this is easily and satisfactorily joined the Ker&#1502; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; (without Makkeph in the correct text), ita ut non descenderem; the infinitive of &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; in this instance following the analogy of the strong verb is &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;, like &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, and with suffix jordi (like josdi, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>) or jaaredi, for here it is to be read thus, and not jordi (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>).<p>(Note: The Masora does not place the word under &#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1495;&#1496;&#1508;&#1497;&#1503; &#1511;&#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1503;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488; &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493; (Introduction 28b), as one would expect to find it if it were to be read mijordi, and proceeds on the assumption that mija&#772;rdi is infinitive like &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1498; (read &#8219;ama&#772;dcha) <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>, not participle (Ewald, S. 533).)<p>The Chethb &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; might also be the infinitive, written with Cholem plenum, as an infinitive <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-20.htm">Genesis 32:20</a>, and an imperative <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8</a>, is each pointed with Cholem instead of Kamtez chatuph; but it is probably intended to be read as a participle, &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;: Thou hast revived me from those who sink away into the grave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>), or out of the state of such (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>) - a perfectly admissible and pregnant construction. </body></html>
