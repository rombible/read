Without the pronoun, we must (with Jerome) understand by “glory” renown or praise, which, as it were, itself raises songs; or it must be concrete, “everything glorious.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-12.htm" title="To the end that my glory may sing praise to you, and not be silent.

When we see our mistake, it becomes us to think with shame upon our carnal security as our folly. If God hide his face, a good man is troubled, though no other calamity befal him. But if God, in wisdom and justice, turn from us, it will be the greatest folly if we turn from him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark. The sanctified spirit, which returns to God, shall praise him, shall be still praising him; but the services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust; it cannot praise him; there is none of that device or working in the grave, for it is the land of silence. We ask aright for life, when we do so that we may live to praise him. In due time God delivered the psalmist out of his troubles. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when employed in praising God. He would persevere to the end in praise, hoping that he should shortly be where this would be the everlasting work. But let all beware of carnal security. Neither outward prosperity, nor inward peace, here, are sure and lasting. The Lord, in his favour, has fixed the believer's safety firm as the deep-rooted mountains, but he must expect to meet with temptations and afflictions. When we grow careless, we fall into sin, the Lord hides his face, our comforts droop, and troubles assail us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee - Margin, my "tongue," or my "soul." DeWette renders it, "my heart." The Aramaic Paraphrase: "that the honorable of the world may praise thee." The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate: "my glory." The reference is, undoubtedly, to what the psalmist regarded as most glorious, honorable, exalted, in himself. There is no evidence that he referred to his "tongue" or his "heart" particularly, but the expression seems to be equivalent to "my highest powers" - all the powers and faculties of my nature. The "tongue" would indeed be the instrument of uttering praise, but still the reference is rather to the exalted powers of the soul than to the instrument. Let all that is capable of praise within me, all my powers, be employed in celebrating the goodness of God.<p>And not be silent - Be employed in praise.<p>O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>. This verse states the purpose which the psalmist now saw that God intended to accomplish by his dealings with him in the varied scenes of his past life; and his own purpose now as he entered his new abode. "The purpose of God," in all these various dealings - in the prosperity which had been bestowed on him <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6-7</a>; in the reverses and trials by sickness or otherwise which had come upon him <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-7.htm">Psalm 30:7</a>; and in the deliverance which God had granted him in answer to his prayers <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2-3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10-11</a> - was, that he should learn to praise the Lord. "His own purpose" now, as he entered his new habitation and dedicated it to God, was, to praise God with his highest powers forever: to consecrate all that he had to his gracious preserver; to make his house, not a habitation of gaiety and sin, but an abode of serious piety - a home where the happiness sought would be that which is found in the influence of religion. It is scarcely necessary to add that every new dwelling should be entered by a family with feelings similar to these; that the first act of the head of a family on entering a new habitation - whether it be a palace or a cottage - should be solemnly to consecrate it to God, and to resolve that it shall be a house where His praises shall be celebrated, and where the influence of religion shall be invoked to guide and sanctify all the members of the household. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Though "my" is supplied before "glory" it is better as in Ps 16:9, to receive it as used for tongue, the organ of praise.

If we allow the ellipse of the personal pronoun supposed by our translators and Revisers, we must regard David as calling his soul "his glory," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>. But some commentators think that "glory" is here used as we use "royalty," and designates the  royal person or the royal office (so Kay and Professor Alexander). <span class="cmt_word">And not be silent. O</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</span> Great mercies deserve perpetual remembrance. David regarded the mercy at this time vouchsafed him as one which, like that vouchsafed Hezekiah, required to be commemorated "all the days of his life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 30:7-8) David now relates his experience in detail, beginning with the cause of the chastisement, which he has just undergone. In &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>) he contrasts his former self-confidence, in which (like the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a>) he thought himself to be immoveable, with the God-ward trust he has now gained in the school of affliction. Instead of confiding in the Giver, he trusted in the gift, as though it had been his own work. It is uncertain, - but it is all the same in the end, - whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497; is the inflected infinitive &#1513;&#1500;&#1493; of the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497; (which we adopt in our translation), or the inflected noun &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;)  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;, after the form &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;, a swimming, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-5.htm">Ezekiel 47:5</a>,  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-21.htm">Jeremiah 22:21</a>. The inevitable consequence of such carnal security, as it is more minutely described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-18</a>, is some humbling divine chastisement. This intimate connection is expressed by the perfects in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-8.htm">Psalm 30:8</a>, which represent God's pardon, God's withdrawal of favour, which is brought about by his self-exaltation, and the surprise of his being undeceived, as synchronous. &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1494;, to set up might is equivalent to: to give it as a lasting possession; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-8.htm">2 Chronicles 33:8</a>, which passage is a varied, but not (as Riehm supposes) a corrupted, repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-8.htm">2 Kings 21:8</a>. It is, therefore, unnecessary, as Hitzig does, to take &#1500; as accusatival and &#1506;&#1494; as adverbial: in Thy favour hadst Thou made my mountain to stand firm. The mountain is Zion, which is strong by natural position and by the additions of art (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>); and this, as being the castle-hill, is the emblem of the kingdom of David: Jahve had strongly established his kingdom for David, when on account of his trust in himself He made him to feel how all that he was he was only by Him, and without Him he was nothing whatever. The form of the inflexion &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;, instead of &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;  equals  harri, is defended by <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a> (where it is &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; as if from &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;). The reading &#1500;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; (lxx, Syr.), i.e., to my kingly dignity is a happy substitution; whereas the reading of the Targum &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;, "placed (me) on firm mountains," at once refutes itself by the necessity for supplying "me."  </body></html>
