The mountain of strength, perhaps mountain fortress, is an image of secure retreat.

When we see our mistake, it becomes us to think with shame upon our carnal security as our folly. If God hide his face, a good man is troubled, though no other calamity befal him. But if God, in wisdom and justice, turn from us, it will be the greatest folly if we turn from him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark. The sanctified spirit, which returns to God, shall praise him, shall be still praising him; but the services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust; it cannot praise him; there is none of that device or working in the grave, for it is the land of silence. We ask aright for life, when we do so that we may live to praise him. In due time God delivered the psalmist out of his troubles. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when employed in praising God. He would persevere to the end in praise, hoping that he should shortly be where this would be the everlasting work. But let all beware of carnal security. Neither outward prosperity, nor inward peace, here, are sure and lasting. The Lord, in his favour, has fixed the believer's safety firm as the deep-rooted mountains, but he must expect to meet with temptations and afflictions. When we grow careless, we fall into sin, the Lord hides his face, our comforts droop, and troubles assail us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lord, by thy favor thou hast made my mountain to stand strong - Margin: "settled strength for my mountain." This refers, I apprehend, to his former state of mind; to his confidence in that which constituted his prosperity as referred to in the previous verse; to his feeling, in that state, that everything pertaining to himself was safe; to his freedom from any apprehension that there would be any change. The word "mountain" seems to be used as denoting that on which he relied as his security or strength, as the mountain, or the inaccessible hills, constituted a refuge and security in times of danger. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1-2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-33.htm">Psalm 18:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>. It does not refer to Mount Moriah, or Mount Zion, as some have supposed, for the passage relates to a former period of his life when these were not in his possession; but he speaks of himself as having, through the favor of God, put himself into a strong position - a position where he feared no enemy and no change; where he thought himself entirely secure - the state of "prosperity" to which he had referred in the previous verse. In that state, however, God showed him that there was no real security but in his favor: security not in what a man can draw around himself, but in the favor of God alone.<p>Thou didst hide thy face - That is, at the time when I was so confident, and when I thought my mountain stood so strong, and that I was so secure. Then I was shown how insecure and uncertain was all that I relied on, and how absolutely, after all that I had done, I was dependent for safety on God. To "hide the face" is synonymous in the sacred writings with the withdrawing of favor, or with displeasure. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>.<p>And I was troubled - I was confounded, perplexed, agitated, terrified. I was thrown into sudden fear, for all that I had so confidently relied on, all that I thought was so firm, was suddenly swept away. We do not know what this was in the case of the psalmist. It may have been the strength of his own fortifications; it may have been the number and discipline of his army; it may have been his own conscious power and skill as a warrior; it may have been his wealth; it may have been his bodily health - in reference to any of which he may have felt as if none of these things could fail. When that on which he so confidently relied was swept away, he was agitated, troubled, anxious. The same thing may occur now, and often does occur, whenpeople rely on their own strength; their health; their wealth. Suddenly any of these may be swept away; suddenly they are often swept away, to teach such men - even good men - their dependence on God, and to show them how vain is every other refuge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. troubled&#8212;confounded with fear (Ps 2:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast made my mountain to stand strong; </span> thou hast so firmly settled me in my kingdom; which he calls his <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">mountain, </span> partly because kingdoms are usually called mountains in prophetical writings, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-3.htm" title="Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.

The psalmist found himself mistaken, and acknowledges it; that as it was not owing to his own merit that he enjoyed the prosperity that he did, so neither was the continuance of it owing to his goodness, power, and strength, but to the free grace and favour of God; as the church of God is compared to a mountain, and the several individuals of believers are like to Mount Zion, so the soul of a child of God may be called his mountain, which is made strong by the Lord as to its state in Christ, being set on him, the Rock of ages, and sure foundation, where it is safe and secure; and as to its grace, whenever it is in any strong exercise, which is altogether owing to the favour of God, and continues as long as he pleases; <p>thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled; the Lord may hide his face from his people, and yet their state be safe; their mountain stands strong in that respect; yet this generally produces a change of frames; it gives trouble, and faith and hope become feeble and languid in their acts and exercises; this shows the changeableness of frames, that they are not to be depended upon; that they are entirely owing to the pleasure of God, and that rejoicing only should be in him: very likely some regard is had to the affair of Absalom's rebellion, which came unawares, unthought of, when David was in the greatest prosperity and security. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, <i>and</i> I <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> was troubled.</span><p>(h) I thought you had established me in Zion most surely.<p>(i) After you had withdrawn your help, I felt my misery.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

Zion, strong by position and art, may be thought of, partly in itself, partly as an emblem of the Davidic kingdom. Fortress and kingdom alike derived their real strength from Jehovah. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-4.htm" title="Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-8.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD your God, which delighted in you to set you on his throne, to be king for the LORD your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he you king over them, to do judgment and justice.">2 Chronicles 9:8</a>. But the reading is doubtful. The LXX, Vulg., and Syr. represent, <span class="ital">hadst established strength for my majesty</span>.

God turned his face away, declared himself angry with his servant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7-12</a>), and sent the dreadful plague which in a single day destroyed seventy thousand lives. Then David, feeling that God's face was indeed turned from him, "was troubled." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 30:2-4) The Psalm begins like a hymn. The Piel &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (from &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, Arab. dla&#770;, to hold anything long, loose and pendulous, whether upwards or downwards, conj. V Arab. tdlla&#770; equals , to dangle) signifies to lift or draw up, like a bucket (&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Latin tollo, tolleno in Festus). The poet himself says what that depth is into which he had sunk and out of which God had drawn him up without his enemies rejoicing over him (&#1500;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a>), i.e., without allowing them the wished for joy at his destruction: he was brought down almost into Hades in consequence of some fatal sickness. &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (never: to call into being out of nothing) always means to restore to life that which has apparently or really succumbed to death, or to preserve anything living in life. With this is easily and satisfactorily joined the Ker&#1502; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; (without Makkeph in the correct text), ita ut non descenderem; the infinitive of &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; in this instance following the analogy of the strong verb is &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;, like &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, and with suffix jordi (like josdi, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>) or jaaredi, for here it is to be read thus, and not jordi (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>).<p>(Note: The Masora does not place the word under &#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1495;&#1496;&#1508;&#1497;&#1503; &#1511;&#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1503;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488; &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493; (Introduction 28b), as one would expect to find it if it were to be read mijordi, and proceeds on the assumption that mija&#772;rdi is infinitive like &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1498; (read &#8219;ama&#772;dcha) <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>, not participle (Ewald, S. 533).)<p>The Chethb &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; might also be the infinitive, written with Cholem plenum, as an infinitive <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-20.htm">Genesis 32:20</a>, and an imperative <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8</a>, is each pointed with Cholem instead of Kamtez chatuph; but it is probably intended to be read as a participle, &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;: Thou hast revived me from those who sink away into the grave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>), or out of the state of such (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>) - a perfectly admissible and pregnant construction. </body></html>
