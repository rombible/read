The Lord is to be praised; we do not want matter, it were well if we did not want a heart. How great is that God, whose the whole earth is, and the fulness thereof; who directs and disposes of all!, The Lord Jesus, whom we are here taught to praise, is a great God; the mighty God is one of his titles, and God over all, blessed for evermore. To him all power is given, both in heaven and earth. He is our God, and we should praise him. He is our Saviour, and the Author of our blessedness. The gospel church is his flock, Christ is the great and good Shepherd of believers; he sought them when lost, and brought them to his fold.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/95.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sea is his - Margin, as in Hebrew, "Whose the sea is."

The creation of anything gives the highest possible right over it.<p>And his hands formed the dry land - He has a claim, therefore, that it should be recognized as his, and that all who dwell upon it, and derive their support from it, should acknowledge him as its great Owner and Lord. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/95.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

It might be more readily regarded as Poel than as Pual (like &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>), but the Kal too already signifies to enter into fellowship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>), therefore (similarly to &#1497;&#1490;&#1512;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>) it is: num consociabitur tecum. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; is here the judgment-seat, just as the Arabic cursi directly denotes the tribunal of God (in distinction from Arab. 'l-&#8219;ars&#780;, the throne of His majesty). With reference to &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a>. Assuming that &#1495;&#1511; is a divine statute, we obtain this meaning for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1511;: which frameth (i.e., plots and executes) trouble, by making the written divine right into a rightful title for unrighteous conduct, by means of which the innocent are plunged into misfortune. Hitzig renders: contrary to order, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>, where, however, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is intended like &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>. Olshausen proposes to read &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>) instead of &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, just as conversely Aben-Ezra in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a> reads &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. But &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1491;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, has the secured signification of scindere, incidere (cf. Arab. jdd, but also chd, supra, p. 255), from which the signification invadere can be easily derived (whence &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, a breaking in, invasion, an invading host). With reference to &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1504;&#1511;&#1497; vid., Psychology, S. 243 (tr. p. 286): because the blood is the soul, that is said of the blood which applies properly to the person. The subject to &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; are the seat of corruption (by which a high council consisting of many may be meant, just as much as a princely throne) and its accomplices. Prophetic certainty is expressed in &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;. The figure of God as &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; is Davidic and Korahitic. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is explained from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. Since &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; designates the retribution as a return of guilt incurred in the form of actual punishment, it might be rendered "requite" just as well as "cause to return;" &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, however, instead of &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a>) makes the idea expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a> more natural. On &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501; Hitzig correctly compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-7.htm">2 Samuel 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>. The Psalm closes with an anadiplosis, just as it began with one; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; affirms that the destruction of the persecutor will follow as surely as the church is able to call Jahve its God. </body></html>
