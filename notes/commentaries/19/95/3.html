Commentators vex themselves with the difficulty of the ascription of a real existence to these tribal deities in the expression,” King above all gods.” But how else was Israel constantly falling into the sin of worshipping them? It was in the inspired rejection of them as possessing any sovereign power, and in the recognition of Jehovah’s supremacy shown by the psalmists and prophets, that the preservation of Israel’s religion consisted.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/95.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>95:1-7 Whenever we come into God's presence, we must come with thanksgiving. The Lord is to be praised; we do not want matter, it were well if we did not want a heart. How great is that God, whose the whole earth is, and the fulness thereof; who directs and disposes of all!, The Lord Jesus, whom we are here taught to praise, is a great God; the mighty God is one of his titles, and God over all, blessed for evermore. To him all power is given, both in heaven and earth. He is our God, and we should praise him. He is our Saviour, and the Author of our blessedness. The gospel church is his flock, Christ is the great and good Shepherd of believers; he sought them when lost, and brought them to his fold.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/95.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Lord is a great God - For Yahweh is a great God. The object is to exalt Jehovah, the true God, as distinguished from all who were worshipped as gods. The first idea is that he is "great;" that he is exalted over all the universe; that he rules over all, and that he is to be worshipped as such.<p>And a great King above all gods - This does not mean that he is a great ruler of all other gods, as if they had a real existence, but that he is king or ruler far above all that were worshipped as gods, or to whom homage was paid. Whoever, or whatever was worshipped as God, Yahweh was supreme over all things. He occupied the throne; and all others must be beneath him, and under his dominion. If the sun, the moon, or the stars were worshipped - if the mountains or the rivers - if angels good or bad - yet Yahweh was above all these. If imaginary beings were worshipped, yet Yahweh in his perfections was exalted far above all that was ascribed to them, for He was the true God, and the Ruler of the universe, while they were beings of the imagination only. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/95.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. above &#8230; gods&#8212;esteemed such by men, though really nothing (Jer 5:7; 10:10-15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/95.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Above all that are accounted and called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">gods, </span> angels, and earthly potentates, and especially the false gods of the heathens, which upon Christ’s coming into the world were struck dumb, and could no more deliver their oracles, as Plutarch and other heathens observed, with admiration, nor deceive the world, but were forced to give place to the true God, and to the knowledge and worship of him alone, which was propagated among all nations by the gospel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/95.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the Lord is a great God,....

Assuming that &#1495;&#1511; is a divine statute, we obtain this meaning for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1511;: which frameth (i.e., plots and executes) trouble, by making the written divine right into a rightful title for unrighteous conduct, by means of which the innocent are plunged into misfortune. Hitzig renders: contrary to order, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>, where, however, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is intended like &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>.

But &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1491;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, has the secured signification of scindere, incidere (cf. Arab. jdd, but also chd, supra, p. 255), from which the signification invadere can be easily derived (whence &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, a breaking in, invasion, an invading host). With reference to &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1504;&#1511;&#1497; vid., Psychology, S. 243 (tr. p. 286): because the blood is the soul, that is said of the blood which applies properly to the person. The subject to &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; are the seat of corruption (by which a high council consisting of many may be meant, just as much as a princely throne) and its accomplices. Prophetic certainty is expressed in &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;. The figure of God as &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; is Davidic and Korahitic. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is explained from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. Since &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; designates the retribution as a return of guilt incurred in the form of actual punishment, it might be rendered "requite" just as well as "cause to return;" &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, however, instead of &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a>) makes the idea expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a> more natural. On &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501; Hitzig correctly compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-7.htm">2 Samuel 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>. The Psalm closes with an anadiplosis, just as it began with one; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; affirms that the destruction of the persecutor will follow as surely as the church is able to call Jahve its God. </body></html>
