Hence either “mines” or “mineral wealth.”<p><span class= "bld">Strength of the hills.</span>—The Hebrew word rendered “strength” is rare, found only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-22.htm" title="God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn.">Numbers 23:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm" title="God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.">Numbers 24:8</a> (“strength of an unicorn”), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-25.htm" title="Yes, the Almighty shall be your defense, and you shall have plenty of silver.">Job 22:25</a> (“plenty of silver;” margin, “silver of strength”). The root to which the word is usually assigned means “to be weary,” from which the idea of strength can only be derived on the <span class= "ital">lucus a non lucendo </span>principle. Keeping the usual derivation, we may, with many critics, give the word the sense of “mines” or “treasures,” because of the labours of extracting metal from the earth. This suits <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-25.htm" title="Yes, the Almighty shall be your defense, and you shall have plenty of silver.">Job 22:25</a>, and makes a good parallelism. But the LXX. and Vulg. have “heights,” and by another derivation the Hebrew may mean shining, and so “sunny summit.” With this agrees the rendering of the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-22.htm" title="God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn.">Numbers 23:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm" title="God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.">Numbers 24:8</a>, and the rhythm is preserved by an antithetic parallelism, as in next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/95.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/95-4.htm" title="In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also....">Psalm 95:4-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">In his hand — </span>Under his government, and in his possession; <span class="ital">are the deep places of the earth — </span>With all the treasures they contain; even those parts which are far out of men’s sight and reach. <span class="ital">The strength of the hills — </span>Which, with majestic pride, tower above, and lift up their heads to heaven; <span class="ital">is his also — </span>Even the highest and strongest mountains are under his feet, and at his disposal. <span class="ital">The sea is his — </span>With its unnumbered waves, which roll in perpetual motion round the world; and all the millions of living creatures, of all forms and sizes, that inhabit its fathomless depths and immeasurable waters. <span class="ital">And his hands formed the dry land </span>— With all its rich and variegated produce, when, by his word, he commanded it to <span class="ital">appear, and it was so; </span>and he crowned it with verdure and beauty.

The Lord is to be praised; we do not want matter, it were well if we did not want a heart. How great is that God, whose the whole earth is, and the fulness thereof; who directs and disposes of all!, The Lord Jesus, whom we are here taught to praise, is a great God; the mighty God is one of his titles, and God over all, blessed for evermore. To him all power is given, both in heaven and earth. He is our God, and we should praise him. He is our Saviour, and the Author of our blessedness. The gospel church is his flock, Christ is the great and good Shepherd of believers; he sought them when lost, and brought them to his fold.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/95.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In his hand - In his power, or under his control as his own. That is, he so possesses all things that they can be claimed by no other. His right over them is absolute and entire.<p>Are the deep places of the earth - The word used here - &#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1512;  mechqa&#770;r - means the interior, the inmost depth; that which is "searched out," from - &#1495;&#1511;&#1512;  cha&#770;qar - to search, search out, explore. The primary idea is that of searching by boring or digging; and the allusion here is to the parts of the earth which could be explored only by digging - as in mining, or sinking shafts in the earth. The meaning is, that all those places which lie beyond the ordinary power of observation in man are in the hand of God. He knows them as clearly as those which are most plain to human view; he possesses or owns them as his own as really as he does those which are on the surface of the ground.<p>The strength of the hills is his also - Margin, "The heights of the hills are his." The word rendered "strength" - &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;  to&#770;&#8219;a&#770;pho&#770;th - means properly swiftness or speed in running; then, weariness, wearisome labor; and hence, wealth obtained by labor; "treasures." Here the expression means "treasures of the mountains;" that is, treasures obtained out of the mountains, the precious metals, etc. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-25.htm">Job 22:25</a>, where the same word occurs. All this belongs to God. As he is the Maker of these hills, and of all that they contain, the absolute proprietorship is in him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/95.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

Assuming that &#1495;&#1511; is a divine statute, we obtain this meaning for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1511;: which frameth (i.e., plots and executes) trouble, by making the written divine right into a rightful title for unrighteous conduct, by means of which the innocent are plunged into misfortune. Hitzig renders: contrary to order, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>, where, however, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is intended like &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>.

But &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1491;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, has the secured signification of scindere, incidere (cf. Arab. jdd, but also chd, supra, p. 255), from which the signification invadere can be easily derived (whence &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, a breaking in, invasion, an invading host). With reference to &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1504;&#1511;&#1497; vid., Psychology, S. 243 (tr. p. 286): because the blood is the soul, that is said of the blood which applies properly to the person. The subject to &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; are the seat of corruption (by which a high council consisting of many may be meant, just as much as a princely throne) and its accomplices.

The figure of God as &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; is Davidic and Korahitic. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is explained from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. Since &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; designates the retribution as a return of guilt incurred in the form of actual punishment, it might be rendered "requite" just as well as "cause to return;" &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, however, instead of &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a>) makes the idea expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a> more natural. On &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501; Hitzig correctly compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-7.htm">2 Samuel 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>. The Psalm closes with an anadiplosis, just as it began with one; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; affirms that the destruction of the persecutor will follow as surely as the church is able to call Jahve its God. </body></html>
