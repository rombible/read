Thus the Psalm begins with a melancholy memorial of the many disgraces and disappointments with which God had, for some years past, chastised the people. For, during the reign of Saul, especially in the latter part of it, and during David’s struggle with the house of Saul, while he reigned over Judah only, the affairs of the kingdom were much perplexed, and the neighbouring nations were very vexatious to them. <span class="ital">Thou hast scattered us — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">פרצתנו</span>, <span class="ital">peratztanu, thou hast broken us; </span>partly by that dreadful overthrow by the Philistines, 1 Samuel 31., and partly by the civil war in our own country between Judah and Israel. <span class="ital">Thou hast been displeased — </span>And thy displeasure, caused by our sins, has been the source of all our sufferings.

And when God is turning his hand in our favour, it is good to remember our former troubles. In God's displeasure their troubles began, therefore in his favour their prosperity must begin. Those breaches and divisions which the folly and corruption of man make, nothing but the wisdom and grace of God can repair, by pouring out a spirit of love and peace, by which only a kingdom is saved from ruin. The anger of God against sin, is the only cause of all misery, private or public, that has been, is, or shall be. In all these cases there is no remedy, but by returning to the Lord with repentance, faith, and prayer; beseeching him to return to us. Christ, the Son of David, is given for a banner to those that fear God; in him they are gathered together in one, and take courage. In his name and strength they wage war with the powers of darkness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O God, thou hast cast us off - The word used here means properly to be foul, rancid, offensive; and then, to treat anything as if it were foul or rancid; to repel, to spurn, to cast away. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a>. It is strong language, meaning that God had seemed to treat them as if they were loathsome or offensive to him. The allusion, according to the view taken in the introduction to the psalm, is to some defeat or disaster which had occurred after the conquests in the East, or during the absence of the armies of David in the East <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18.htm">1 Chronicles 18</a>; probably to the fact that the Edomites had taken occasion to invade the southern part of Palestine, and that the forces employed to expel them had been unsuccessful.<p>Thou hast scattered us - Margin, broken. So the Hebrew. The word is applied to the forces of war which are broken and scattered by defeat, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>.<p>Thou hast been displeased - The word used here means "to breathe"; to breathe hard; and then, to be angry. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>. God had treated them as if he was displeased or angry. He had suffered them to be defeated.<p>O turn thyself to us again - Return to our armies, and give us success. This might be rendered, "Thou wilt turn to us;" that is, thou wilt favor us - expressing a confident belief that God would do this, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-12.htm">Psalm 60:12</a>. It is more in accordance, however, with the usual structure of the Psalms to regard this as a prayer. Many of the psalms begin with a prayer, and end with the expression of a confident assurance that the prayer has been, or would certainly be heard. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 60<p>Ps 60:1-12. Shushan-eduth&#8212;Lily of testimony. The lily is an emblem of beauty (see on [601]Ps 45:1, title). As a description of the Psalm, those terms combined may denote a beautiful poem, witnessing&#8212;that is, for God's faithfulness as evinced in the victories referred to in the history cited. Aram-naharaim&#8212;Syria of the two rivers, or Mesopotamia beyond the river (Euphrates) (2Sa 10:16). Aram-zobah&#8212;Syria of Zobah (2Sa 10:6), to whose king the king of the former was tributary. The war with Edom, by Joab and Abishai (2Ch 18:12, 25), occurred about the same time. Probably, while doubts and fears alternately prevailed respecting the issue of these wars, the writer composed this Psalm, in which he depicts, in the language of God's people, their sorrows under former disasters, offers prayer in present straits, and rejoices in confident hope of triumph by God's aid.<p>1-3. allude to disasters.<p>cast &#8230; off&#8212;in scorn (Ps 43:2; 44:9).<p>scattered&#8212;broken our strength (compare 2Sa 5:20).<p>Oh, turn thyself&#8212;or, "restore to us" (prosperity).

David found himself the possessor of a tottering throne, troubled with the double evil of faction at home, and invasion from abroad. He traced at once the evil to its true source, and began at the fountainhead. His were the politics of piety, which after all are the wisest and most profound. He knew that the displeasure of the Lord had brought calamity upon the nation, and to the removal of that displeasure he set himself by earnest prayer. "O God, thou hast cut us off." Thou hast treated us as foul and offensive things, to be put away; as mean and beggarly persons, to be shunned with contempt; as useless dead boughs to be torn away from the tree which they disfigure. To be cast off by God is the worst calamity that can befal a man or a people; but the worst form of it is when the person is not aware of it and is indifferent to it. When the divine desertion causes mourning and repentance, it will be but partial and temporary. When a cast-off soul sighs for its God it is not indeed cast off at all. "Thou hast scattered us." David clearly sees the fruits of the divine anger, he traces the flight of Israel's warriors, the breaking of her power, the division in her body politic, to the hand of God. Whoever might be the secondary agent of these disasters, he beholds the Lord's hand as the prime moving cause, and pleads with the Lord concerning the matter. Israel was like a city with a breach made in its wall, because her God was wroth with her. These first two verses, with their depressing confession, must be regarded as greatly enhancing the power of the faith which in the after verses rejoices in better days, through the Lord's gracious return unto his people. "Thou hast been displeased." This is the secret of our miseries. Had we pleased thee, thou wouldst have pleased us; but as we have walked contrary to thee, thou hast walked contrary to us. "O turn thyself to us again." Forgive the sin and smile once more. Turn us to thee, turn thou to us. Aforetime thy face was towards thy people, be pleased to look on us again with thy favour and grace. Some read it, "Thou wilt turn to us again," and it makes but slight difference which way we take it, for a true-hearted prayer brings a blessing so soon that it is no presumption to consider it as already obtained. There was more need for God to turn to his people than for Judah's troops to be brave, or Joab and the commanders wise. God with us is better than strong battalions; God displeased is more terrible than all the Edomites that ever marched into the valley of salt, or all the devils that ever opposed the church. If the Lord turn to us, what care we for Aram-naharaim or Aram-zobah, or death, or hell? but if he withdraw his presence we tremble at the fall of a leaf.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a><p>"Thou hast made the earth to tremble." Things were as unsettled as though the solid earth had been made to quake; nothing was stable; the priests had been murdered by Saul, the worst men had been put in office, the military power had been broken by the Philistines, and the civil authority had grown despicable through insurrections and intestine contests. "Thou hast broken it." As the earth cracks, and opens itself in rifts during violent earthquakes, so was the kingdom rent with strife and calamity. "Heal the breaches thereof." As a house in time of earthquakes is shaken, and the walls begin to crack, and gape with threatening fissures, so was it with the kingdom. "For it shaketh." It tottered to a fall; if not soon propped up and repaired it would come down in complete ruin. So far gone was Israel, that only God's interposition could preserve it from utter destruction. How often have we seen churches in this condition, and how suitable is the prayer before us, in which the extremity of the need is used, as an argument for help. The like may be said of our own personal religion, it is sometimes so tried, that like a house shaken by earthquake it is ready to come down with a crash, and none but the Lord himself can repair its breaches, and save us from utter destruction.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a><p>"Thou hast showed thy people hard things." Hardships had been heaped upon them, and the Psalmist traces these rigorous providences to their fountainhead. Nothing had happened by chance, but all had come by divine design and with a purpose, yet for all that things had gone hard with Israel. The Psalmist claims that they were still the Lord's own people, though in the first verse he had said, "thou hast cast us off." The language of complaint is usually confused, and faith in time of trouble ere long contradicts the desponding statements of the flesh. "Thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment." Our afflictions have made us like men drunken with some potent and bitter wine; we are in amazement, confusion, delirium; our steps reel, and we stagger as those about to fall. The great physician gives his patients potent potions to purge out their abounding and deep-seated diseases. Astonishing evils bring with them astonishing results. The grapes of the vineyard of sin produce a wine which fills the most hardened with anguish when justice compels them to quaff the cup. There is a fire-water of anguish of soul which even to the righteous makes a cup of trembling, which causes them to be exceeding sorrowful almost unto death. When grief becomes so habitual as to be our drink, and to take the place of our joys, becoming our only wine, then are we in an evil case indeed.  <span class="bld">Shushan-eduth:</span> this, like the rest, seems to be the name of an instrument, or song, or tune, then well known, but now quite unknown and forgotten; it may be and is by some rendered, <span class="ital">the lily</span> or <span class="ital">rose</span> of <span class="ital">thy testimony</span> or <span class="ital">oracle</span>; but why it was so called is a matter of mere conjecture, and of small importance to us to know.

This refers to the casting off of the Jews as a church and nation, when they had rejected the Messiah and killed him, persecuted his apostles, and despised his Gospel; of which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm">Romans 11:15</a>; <p>thou hast scattered us; as they were by the Romans among the various nations of the world, and among whom they are dispersed to this day; or "thou hast broken us" (k), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12</a>; not only the walls of their city were broken by the battering rams of the Romans, but their commonwealth, their civil state, were broke to pieces by them.

The Ker says that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> is to be read: &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;, my gracious God will anticipate me, - but with what? This question altogether disappears if we retain the Chethb and point &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;: my God will anticipate me with His mercy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>), i.e., will meet me bringing His mercy without any effort of mine. Even the old translators have felt that chcdw must belong to the verb as a second object. The lxx is perfectly correct in its rendering, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;. The Ker has come into existence in looking to v. 18, according to which it seems as though &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; ought to be added to the refrain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> (cf. a similar instance in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6-7</a>). But <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> would be stunted by doing this, and it accords with Biblical poetic usage that the refrain in v. 18 should be climactic in comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> (just as it also does not altogether harmonize in its first half); so that Olshausen's proposal to close <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; and to begin <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> with &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>) is only just to be put on record. The prayer "slay them not" does not contradict the prayer that follows for their destruction. The poet wishes that those who lie in wait for him, before they are totally swept away, may remain for a season before the eyes of this people as an example of punishment. In accordance with this, &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;, by a comparison of the Hiph. in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-13.htm">Numbers 32:13</a>, and of the Kal in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, is to be rendered: cause them to wander about (Targum, cf. Genesis Rabba, ch. 38 init., &#1496;&#1500;&#1496;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;); and in connection with &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; one is involuntarily reminded of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>, and is tempted to read &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1498; or &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1498;: cause them to wander about in adversity or wretchedness,  equals  Arab. &#8219;umr h&#803;a&#770;lik, vita caliginosa h. e. misera), and more especially since &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; occurs nowhere else instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1498; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;. But the Jod in &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; is unfavourable to this supposition; and since the martial apostrophe of God by "our shield" follows, the choice of the word is explained by the consideration that the poet conceives of the power of God as an army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>), and perhaps thinks directly of the heavenly host (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>), over which the Lord of Hosts holds command (Hitzig). By means of this He is first of all to cause them to go astray (&#1504;&#1506; &#1493;&#1504;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>), then utterly to cast them down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>). The Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;) is to do this, as truly as He is Israel's shield against all the heathen and all pseudo-Israelites who have become as heathen. The first member of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-13.htm">Psalm 59:13</a> is undoubtedly meant descriptively: "the sin of their mouth (the sin of the tongue) is the word of their lips" (with the dull-toned suffix mo, in the use of which <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a> associates itself with the Psalms of the time of Saul, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1-13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1-7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1-15</a>, 22, 35, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/64-1.htm">Psalm 64:1-10</a>). The combination &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, however, more readily suggests parallel passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-6.htm">Proverbs 11:6</a> than <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2</a>; and moreover the &#1502;&#1503; of the expression &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;, which is without example in connection with &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, and, taken as expressing the motive (Hupfeld), ought to be joined with some designations of the disposition of mind, is best explained as an appended statement of the reason for which they are to be ensnared, so that consequently &#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-6.htm">Psalm 64:6</a>) is an attributive clause; nor is this contrary to the accentuation, if one admits the Munach to be a transformation of Mugrash. It is therefore to be rendered: "let them, then, be taken in their pride, and on account of the curse and deceit which they wilfully utter." If, by virtue of the righteousness of the Ruler of the world, their sin has thus become their fall, then, after they have been as it were a warning example to Israel, God is utterly to remove them out of the way, in order that they (it is unnecessary to suppose any change of subject), while perishing, may perceive that Elohim is Ruler in Jacob (&#1489;&#1468;, used elsewhere of the object, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>, is here used of the place of dominion), and as in Jacob, so from thence unto the ends of the earth (&#1500; like &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-11.htm">Psalm 48:11</a>) wields the sceptre. Just like the first group of the first part, this first group of the second part also closes with Sela.<p>The second group opens like the second group in the first part, but with this exception, that here we read &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, which loosely connects it with what precedes, whereas there it is &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;. The poet's gaze is again turned towards his present straitened condition, and again the pack of dogs by which Saul is hunting him present themselves to his mind. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; points towards an antithesis that follows, and which finds its expression in &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; stand in direct contrast to one another, and in addition to this &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; has preceded. The reading of the lxx (Vulgate, Luther, [and authorized version]), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is thereby proved to be erroneous. But if &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is the correct reading, then it follows that we have to take <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a> not as foretelling what will take place, but as describing that which is present; so that consequently the fut. consec. (as is frequently the case apart from any historical connection) is only a consecutive continuation of &#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (for which the Ker has &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;; the form that was required in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>, but is inadmissible here): they wander up and down (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, cf. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>) to eat (that is to say, seeking after food); and if they are not satisfied, they pass the night, i.e., remain, eager for food and expecting it, over night on the spot. This interpretation is the most natural, the simplest, and the one that harmonizes best not only with the text before us (the punctuation &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, not &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, gives the member of the clause the impress of being a protasis), but also with the situation. The poet describes the activity of his enemies, and that by completing or retouching the picture of their comparison to dogs: he himself is the food or prey for which they are so eager, and which they would not willingly allow to escape them, and which they nevertheless cannot get within their grasp. Their morbid desire remains unsatisfied: he, however, in the morning, is able to sing of the power of God, which protects him, and exultantly to praise God's loving-kindness, which satiates and satisfies him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a>); for in the day of fear, which to him is now past, God was his inaccessible stronghold, his unapproachable asylum. To this God, then, even further the play of his harp shall be directed (&#1488;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;), just as was his waiting or hoping (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>). </body></html>
