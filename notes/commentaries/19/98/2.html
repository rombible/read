Converts sing a new song, very different from what they had sung. If the grace of God put a new heart into our breasts, it will put a new song into our mouths. Let this new song be sung to the praise of God, in consideration of the wonders he has wrought. The Redeemer has overcome all difficulties in the way of our redemption, and was not discouraged by the services or sufferings appointed him. Let us praise him for the discoveries made to the world of the work of redemption; his salvation and his righteousness fulfilling the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament. In pursuance of this design, God raised up his Son Jesus to be not only a Light to lighten the Gentiles, but the glory of his people Israel. Surely it behoves us to inquire whether his holy arm hath gotten the victory in our hearts, over the power of Satan, unbelief, and sin? If this be our happy case, we shall exchange all light songs of vanity for songs of joy and thanksgiving; our lives will celebrate the Redeemer's praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/98.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord hath made known his salvation - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>. This does not mean that he had merely "proclaimed" his salvation, or his willingness to save, but that he had shown his salvation - his power to save - by some public act. What the particular act referred to here was, it is impossible now to ascertain. Such acts, however, have been often performed, as when he delivered his people out of Egypt; when he restored the Hebrews from the Babylonian captivity; and whenever he interposed in their behalf in times of danger. He has done it also in the gift of a Saviour; he does it in every revival of true religion; he does it in the salvation of a single sinner.<p>His righteousness - His righteous character; his faithfulness to his people. Whenever he interposes, it is in behalf of that which is right; and such interposition, therefore, is an illustration of his character as just. It is in this way we learn that his character is that of a just God.<p>Hath he openly showed - Margin, as in Hebrew, "revealed." He has disclosed it, or made it manifest.<p>In the sight of the heathen - The nations; or, so that the nations could see it: that is, the nations outside of Pa estine. His acts were so public - so remarkable - that surrounding nations could learn what was his true character. Thus it was when he delivered his people from Egyptian bondage; and thus also frequently in the history of his people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/98.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. salvation&#8212;the result of His righteousness (Ps 7:17; 31:1), and both are publicly displayed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/98.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His salvation; </span> the redemption or salvation of the world by the Messias; which was hitherto reserved as a secret among the Jews, yea, was not thoroughly known and believed by the most of the Jews themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His righteousness; </span> either his faithfulness in accomplishing this great promise of sending the Messias; or his goodness and mercy, oft called by this Hebrew word; or the righteousness of God or of Christ revealed in the gospel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/98.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord hath made known his salvation,.... Which was appointed him, he undertook, came to perform, and has effected; this, though wrought out, is unknown to men, especially to the Gentile world, who had no prophecy, promise, or revelation of the Messiah, and salvation by him; but now this is made known in the everlasting Gospel, called therefore the Gospel of salvation, and by the ministers of it; and, besides this, the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Christ, and his salvation, is given to some; whereby they come to know their need of it, the suitableness of it to their case, the necessity of going to Christ for it, and their special and particular interest in it; and such have a new song put into their mouths, and are under great obligation to sing it: <p>his righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the Heathen; either the faithfulness of God in fulfilling his promises, particularly in raising up the Saviour Jesus; or the goodness of God to his people, and the strictness of his justice on their surety; goodness towards them, and severity on him, when he spared them and not him, turned his hand of grace and mercy on them, when he awoke the sword of justice against him; or rather his own righteousness, by which he fulfilled the law in the room and stead of his people; and which being brought in is revealed in the gospel, from faith to faith; and that "openly", not in dark shadows, types, and figures; but it is to be seen with open face in the clear glass of the Gospel; and is held up and forth in the ministration of it unto the Gentiles, whom God justifies through faith in it, as well as the believing Jews; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-30.htm">Romans 3:30</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/98.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD hath made known his <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.</span><p>(c) For the deliverance of his Church.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/98.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.
