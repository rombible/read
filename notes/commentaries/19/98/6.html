The different orders of rational creatures in the universe, seem to be described in figurative language in the reign of the great Messiah. The kingdom of Christ will be a blessing to the whole creation. We expect his second coming to begin his glorious reign. Then shall heaven and earth rejoice, and the joy of the redeemed shall be full. But sin and its dreadful effects will not be utterly done away, till the Lord come to judge the world in righteousness. Seeing then that we look for such things, let us give diligence that we may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/98.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With trumpets - The word used here is uniformly rendered "trumpets" in the Scriptures. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-6.htm">Numbers 31:6</a>; et al.
