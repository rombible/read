The different orders of rational creatures in the universe, seem to be described in figurative language in the reign of the great Messiah. The kingdom of Christ will be a blessing to the whole creation. We expect his second coming to begin his glorious reign. Then shall heaven and earth rejoice, and the joy of the redeemed shall be full. But sin and its dreadful effects will not be utterly done away, till the Lord come to judge the world in righteousness. Seeing then that we look for such things, let us give diligence that we may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/98.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11</a>.<p>The world, and they that dwell therein - The habitable world - the land - in contradistinction from the sea.

Handel, in some of his sublime choruses, would have been glad of its aid to express his lofty conceptions, and assuredly the inspired Psalmist did well to call in such infinite uproar. The sea is his, let it praise its Maker. Within and upon its bosom it bears a wealth of goodness, why should it be denied a place in the orchestra of nature? Its deep bass will excellently suit the mystery of the divine glory. "The world, and they that dwell therein." The land should be in harmony with the ocean. Its mountains and plains, cities and villages, should prolong the voice of jubilee which welcomes the Lord of all. Nothing can be more sublime than this verse; the muses of Parnassus cannot rival the muse of Zion, the Castalian fount never sparkled like that "fount of every blessing" to which sacred bards are wont to ascribe their inspiration. Yet no song is equal to the majesty of the theme when Jehovah, the King, is to be extolled.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-8.htm">Psalm 98:8</a><p>"Let the floods clap their hands." The rolling rivers, the tidal estuaries, the roaring cataracts, are here summoned to pay their homage, and to clap their hands, as men do when they greet their sovereigns with acclamation. "Let the hills be joyful together," or in concert with the floods. Silent as are the mighty mountains, let them forget themselves, and burst forth into a sublime uproariousness of mirth, such as the poet described when he wrote those vivid lines - <p>"Far along,<p>From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,<p>Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lane cloud,<p>But every mountain now hath found a tongue,<p>And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,<p>Back to the joyous Alps, who car to her aloud."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-9.htm">Psalm 98:9</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/98.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The fulness thereof; </span> all those creatures wherewith it is replenished, which by a poetical strain are invited to praise God. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-11.htm" title="Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof.">Psalm 96:11</a>"</span>, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-12.htm" title="Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice">Psalm 96:12</a>"</span>, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-13.htm" title="Before the LORD: for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.">Psalm 96:13</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/98.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof,....
