The different orders of rational creatures in the universe, seem to be described in figurative language in the reign of the great Messiah. The kingdom of Christ will be a blessing to the whole creation. We expect his second coming to begin his glorious reign. Then shall heaven and earth rejoice, and the joy of the redeemed shall be full. But sin and its dreadful effects will not be utterly done away, till the Lord come to judge the world in righteousness. Seeing then that we look for such things, let us give diligence that we may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/98.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sing unto the Lord with the harp - A song or psalm accompanied by the harp. On the harp. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>.<p>And the voice of a psalm - The voice in singing; a musical voice. Let it not be mere instrumental music, but let that be accompanied with the voice uttering intelligible sounds or words. The only proper use of instrumental music in the worship of God is to deepen the impression which the words are adapted to make; to secure a better influence of truth on the heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/98.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6. make a loud noise&#8212;or, "burst forth" (Isa 14:7; 44:23).<p>before &#8230; King&#8212;hail Him as your sovereign; and while, with every aid to demonstrate zeal and joy, intelligent creatures are invited to praise, as in Ps 96:11-13, inanimate nature is also summoned to honor Him who triumphs and rules in righteousness and equity.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/98.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The worship of the New Testament is here described in phrases taken from the rites of the old, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-3.htm" title="On an instrument of ten strings, and on the psaltery; on the harp with a solemn sound.">Psalm 92:3</a></span>, and oft elsewhere. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/98.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Sing unto the Lord with the harp,....

It is an encouraging admonition to fidelity in an age in which an effeminate spirit of looking longingly towards lit. ogling heathenism was rife, and stedfast adherence to Jahve was threatened with loss of life. Those who are faithful in their confession, as in the Maccabaean age (&#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), are called &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;. The beautiful figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-11.htm">Psalm 97:11</a> is misapprehended by the ancient versions, inasmuch as they read &#1494;&#1512;&#1495; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>) instead of &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;. &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; does not here signify sown  equals  strewn into the earth, but strewn along his life's way, so that he, the righteous one, advances step by step in the light.
