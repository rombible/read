We should desire our Christian friends, when they have any good work in hand, to call for us, and take us with them. With what readiness should we think of the heavenly Jerusalem! How cheerfully should we bear the cross and welcome death, in hopes of a crown of glory! Jerusalem is called the beautiful city. It was a type of the gospel church, which is compact together in holy love and Christian communion, so that it is all as one city. If all the disciples of Christ were of one mind, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, their enemies would be deprived of their chief advantages against them. But Satan's maxim always has been, to divide that he may conquer; and few Christians are sufficiently aware of his designs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/122.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem - We shall enter the sacred city. It appears now in full view before us - its walls, its palaces, its sacred places. We shall not stand and gaze upon it at a distance; we shall not merely be charmed with its beauty as we approach it; we shall accomplish the object of our desire, and enter within its walls and gates. So the believer approaches heaven - the New Jerusalem above. he will not merely admire its exterior, and look upon it at a distance; but he will enter in. He draws nearer and nearer to it, and as he approaches it when he is dying, its beauty becomes the more charming to his view, and the joy of his heart increases as he now feels the assurance that he will "stand within its gates:" that he will enter there, and dwell there forever. So said Dr. Payson, when approaching the end of life: "The celestial city is full in my view. Its glories beam upon me, its breezes fan me, its odors are wafted to me, its sounds strike upon my ears, and its spirit is breathed into my heart. Nothing separates me from it but the river of death, which now appears but as an insignificant rill, that may be crossed at a single step, whenever God shall give permission. The Sun of Righteousness has been gradually drawing nearer and nearer, appearing larger and brighter as he approached, and now he fills the whole hemisphere - pouring forth a flood of glory, in which I seem to float like an insect in the beams of the sun; exulting, yet almost trembling, while I gaze on this excessive brightness, and wondering with unutterable wonder why God should deign thus to shine upon a sinful worm." Works, i. 407. See also the exquisite description of the glories of heaven, familiar to all, as described by Bunyan, as the Christian pilgrims were about to cross the river of death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/122.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. gates&#8212;(Compare Ps 9:14; 87:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/122.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Our feet shall stand; </span> thither we shall come, and there we shall make our abode during the times of solemn worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Within thy gates, O Jerusalem; </span> in that city where the ark is now fixed.

Which is to be understood not merely literally of the city of Jerusalem, and of continuance in the possession of it, it being lately taken out of the hands of the Jebusites; but spiritually of the church of God, which is often called by this name; the gates of which are the same as the gates of Zion, and the gates of wisdom, the word and ordinances; attendance on which is signified by "standing": and which also denotes continuance therein: and happy are those that are within these gates, and have a comfortable assurance of their abiding there; and still more happy will they be who will be admitted within the gates of the New Jerusalem, which are said to be twelve, and every, one of them of one pearl; and through which none shall enter into the city but pure and holy persons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/122.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Our <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.</span><p>(b) Which were wont to wander to and fro, as the ark moved.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/122.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Our feet shall stand</span>] The verb cannot be rendered thus. It may mean ‘have been and still are standing,’ hence R.V. <span class="ital">are standing</span>; or were standing, which is the most natural rendering. The somewhat unusual combination of the participle with the substantive verb may be an indication of the lateness of the Psalm (the idiom is common in Nehemiah), but it gives prominence to the idea of duration (Driver, <span class="ital">Tenses</span>, § 135. 5). It suggests that when the pilgrims reached the city gates, they halted for a while, spell-bound by the sight of its magnificence, and by the memories of its ancient glories.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2–4</span>.

The expression in fact is &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, and not &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;. And the mountains towards which the psalmist raises his eyes are not any mountains whatsoever. In Ezekiel the designation of his native land from the standpoint of the Mesopotamian plain is "the mountains of Israel." His longing gaze is directed towards the district of these mountains, they are his k&#803;ibla, i.e., the sight-point of his prayer, as of Daniel's, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-11.htm">Daniel 6:11</a>. To render "from which my help cometh" (Luther) is inadmissible. &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is an interrogative even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-4.htm">Joshua 2:4</a>, where the question is an indirect one. The poet looks up to the mountains, the mountains of his native land, the holy mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>), when he longingly asks: whence will my help come? and to this question his longing desire itself returns the answer, that his help comes from no other quarter than from Jahve, the Maker of heaven and earth, from His who sits enthroned behind and upon these mountains, whose helpful power reaches to the remotest ends and corners of His creation, and with (&#1506;&#1501;) whom is help, i.e., both the willingness and the power to help, so that therefore help comes from nowhere but from (&#1502;&#1503;) Him alone. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a> the poet has propounded a question, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a> replies to this question himself. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a> and further the answering one goes on speaking to the questioner. The poet is himself become objective, and his Ego, calm in God, promises him comfort, by unfolding to him the joyful prospects contained in that hope in Jahve. The subjective &#1488;&#1500; expresses a negative in both cases with an emotional rejection of that which is absolutely impossible. The poet says to himself: He will, indeed, surely not abandon thy foot to the tottering (&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1496;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-9.htm">Psalm 66:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>), thy Keeper will surely not slumber; and then confirms the assertion that this shall not come to pass by heightening the expression in accordance with the step-like character of the Psalm: Behold the Keeper of Israel slumbereth not and sleepeth not, i.e., He does not fall into slumber from weariness, and His life is not an alternate waking and sleeping. The eyes of His providence are ever open over Israel. </body></html>
