The administration of justice was the original and principal duty of a monarch in time of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-11.htm" title="And God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life; neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies; but have asked for yourself understanding to discern judgment;">1Kings 3:11</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The marginal “do sit” gives the literal rendering of the Hebrew, which in this use of <span class= "ital">sit, </span>where we should say in English <span class= "ital">stand, </span>is exactly the provincial Scotch.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/122.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>122:1-5 The pleasure and profit from means of grace, should make us disregard trouble and fatigue in going to them; and we should quicken one another to what is good. We should desire our Christian friends, when they have any good work in hand, to call for us, and take us with them. With what readiness should we think of the heavenly Jerusalem! How cheerfully should we bear the cross and welcome death, in hopes of a crown of glory! Jerusalem is called the beautiful city. It was a type of the gospel church, which is compact together in holy love and Christian communion, so that it is all as one city. If all the disciples of Christ were of one mind, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, their enemies would be deprived of their chief advantages against them. But Satan's maxim always has been, to divide that he may conquer; and few Christians are sufficiently aware of his designs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/122.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For there are set - Margin, Do sit. The Hebrew is, "For there sit thrones for judgment." They are established there; or, That is the appointed place for administering justice.<p>Thrones of judgment - Seats for dispensing justice. The word throne is now commonly appropriated to the seat or chair of a king, but this is not necessarily the meaning here. The word may denote a seat or bench occupied by a judge. The meaning here is, that Jerusalem was the supreme seat of justice; the place where justice was dispensed for the nation. It was at once the religious and the civil capital of the nation.<p>The thrones of the house of David - Of the family of David, who performed the office of magistrates, or who administered justice. The family of David would naturally be employed in such a service as this. This office, Absalom - who had not been appointed to it - earnestly desired, in order that he might secure popularity in his contemplated rebellion.

In the church of Christ, the heavenly Jerusalem, every saint is a king, as well as a priest, and all have thrones and seats there; have a power of judging, not only lesser matters pertaining to this life, but such as regard the spiritual peace and welfare of the church and interest of Christ; having laws and rules given them to go by, in the admission and exclusion of members, and respecting their conduct to each other, and to their Lord and head: and in the New Jerusalem there will be thrones set, not only for the twelve apostles of Christ, and for the martyrs of Jesus, but for all the saints; there will be the thrones of God and of the Lamb, and every overcomer shall sit down on the same; this honour will have all the saints, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/122.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> David.</span><p>(e) In whose house God placed the throne of justice, and made it a figure of Christ's kingdom.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/122.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

Jahve is his Keeper, He is his shade upon his right hand (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>, and frequently; the construct state instead of an apposition, cf. e.g., Arab. ja&#770;nbu 'l-grb&#305;&#770;yi, the side of the western  equals  the western side), which protecting him and keeping him fresh and cool, covers him from the sun's burning heat. &#1506;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>, with the idea of an overshadowing that screens and spreads itself out over anything (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>). To the figure of the shadow is appended the consolation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a>. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; of the sun signifies to smite injuriously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10</a>), plants, so that they wither (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-5.htm">Psalm 102:5</a>), and the head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>), so that symptoms of sun-stroke (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-19.htm">2 Kings 4:19</a>, Judith 8:2f.) appears. The transferring of the word of the moon is not zeugmatic. Even the moon's rays may become insupportable, may affect the eyes injuriously, and (more particularly in the equatorial regions) produce fatal inflammation of the brain.<p>(Note: Many expositors, nevertheless, understand the destructive influence of the moon meant here of the nightly cold, which is mentioned elsewhere in the same antithesis. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>. De Sacy observes also: On dit quelquefois d'un grand froid, comme d'un grand chaud, qu'il est brulant.

Jahve, says the poet to himself, will keep (guard) thee against all evil, of whatever kind it may be and whencesoever it may threaten; He will keep thy soul, and therefore thy life both inwardly and outwardly; He will keep (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1470;, cf. on the other hand &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1470; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>) thy going out and coming in, i.e., all thy business and intercourse of life (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>, and frequently); for, as Chrysostom observes, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, therefore: everywhere and at all times; and that from this time forth even for ever.
