We should desire our Christian friends, when they have any good work in hand, to call for us, and take us with them. With what readiness should we think of the heavenly Jerusalem! How cheerfully should we bear the cross and welcome death, in hopes of a crown of glory! Jerusalem is called the beautiful city. It was a type of the gospel church, which is compact together in holy love and Christian communion, so that it is all as one city. If all the disciples of Christ were of one mind, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, their enemies would be deprived of their chief advantages against them. But Satan's maxim always has been, to divide that he may conquer; and few Christians are sufficiently aware of his designs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/122.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whither the tribes - The twelve tribes of the children of Israel.<p>Go up - To the great feasts and festivals of the nation.

The twelve tribes of Israel; the males of them went up three times a year to Jerusalem to worship, at the feasts of passover, pentecost, and tabernacles; and was typical of the church of Christ, where the worship of God is carried on, his word preached, and ordinances administered; and whither saints go and attend for their own profit and the glory of God; this is the city of our solemnities, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>; <p>unto the testimony of Israel; the ark of the testimony a symbol of the divine Presence. The law is called a testimony, because it testified the will of God to be done; this was put into an ark, which had its name from thence, and was typical of Christ, the end of the law for righteousness; and over the ark was the divine Presence: hither the tribes came to worship God, and to consult him; <p>"who (the Targum here says) testifies to Israel, that his divine Majesty dwells among them, when they go to confess unto the name of the Lord.'' <p>The Gospel is called the testimony of Christ; and it is what testifies concerning his person, office, and grace, unto the Israel of God; and who go up to the house of God in order to hear it; <p>to give thanks unto the name of the Lord; for all his mercies and blessings, both temporal and spiritual; and which should be acknowledged, not only in a private manner, but publicly in the house of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/122.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whither <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.</span><p>(d) All the tribes according to God's covenant will come and pray there.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/122.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

Jahve is his Keeper, He is his shade upon his right hand (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>, and frequently; the construct state instead of an apposition, cf. e.g., Arab. ja&#770;nbu 'l-grb&#305;&#770;yi, the side of the western  equals  the western side), which protecting him and keeping him fresh and cool, covers him from the sun's burning heat. &#1506;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>, with the idea of an overshadowing that screens and spreads itself out over anything (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>). To the figure of the shadow is appended the consolation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a>. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; of the sun signifies to smite injuriously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10</a>), plants, so that they wither (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-5.htm">Psalm 102:5</a>), and the head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>), so that symptoms of sun-stroke (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-19.htm">2 Kings 4:19</a>, Judith 8:2f.) appears. The transferring of the word of the moon is not zeugmatic. Even the moon's rays may become insupportable, may affect the eyes injuriously, and (more particularly in the equatorial regions) produce fatal inflammation of the brain.<p>(Note: Many expositors, nevertheless, understand the destructive influence of the moon meant here of the nightly cold, which is mentioned elsewhere in the same antithesis. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>. De Sacy observes also: On dit quelquefois d'un grand froid, comme d'un grand chaud, qu'il est brulant. The Arabs also say of snow and of cold as of fire: jah&#803;rik, it burns.)<p>From the hurtful influences of nature that are round about him the promise extends in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7-8</a> in every direction. Jahve, says the poet to himself, will keep (guard) thee against all evil, of whatever kind it may be and whencesoever it may threaten; He will keep thy soul, and therefore thy life both inwardly and outwardly; He will keep (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1470;, cf. on the other hand &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1470; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>) thy going out and coming in, i.e., all thy business and intercourse of life (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>, and frequently); for, as Chrysostom observes, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, therefore: everywhere and at all times; and that from this time forth even for ever. In connection with this the thought is natural, that the life of him who stands under the so universal and unbounded protection of eternal love can suffer no injury. </body></html>
