The God whom they acknowledge as their God is not one whose strength fails, or who is seen to be feeble and powerless when his aid is needed. He is fully equal to all their needs, and they never trust him in vain. "Blessed be God." For all that he is, for all that he has done. This is the language of joy and praise in view of the contemplation of his character as depicted in the psalm. At the close of every right contemplation of his character, his government, his plans, his claims, his law, his gospel, the heart that is right will say, "Blessed be such a God." To one endowed with "such" attributes, praise - everlasting praise - is due. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/68.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32-36.

The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a> is addressed to Israel, or rather to its king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-16.htm">Psalm 86:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>): God, to whom everything is subject, has given Israel &#1506;&#1494;, victory and power over the world. Out of the consciousness that He alone can preserve Israel upon this height of power upon which it is placed, who has placed it thereon, grows the prayer: establish (&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; with &#1493;&#1468; for u&#774;, as is frequently the case, and with the accent on the ultima on account of the following Aleph, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>), Elohim, that which Thou hast wrought for us; &#1506;&#1494;&#1494;, roborare, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-28.htm">Proverbs 8:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>, lxx &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. It might also be interpreted: show Thyself powerful (cf. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, 21:14), Thou who (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>) hast wrought for us (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>, with &#1500;, like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-3.htm">Isaiah 64:3</a>); but in the other way of taking it the prayer attaches itself more sequentially to what precedes, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a> shows that &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; can also represent the neuter. Hitzig has a still different rendering: the powerful divine help, which Thou hast given us; but although - instead of -&#1514; in the stat. construct. is Ephraimitish style (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>), yet &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1494; is an unknown word, and the expression "from Thy temple," which is manifestly addressed to Elohim, shows that &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468; is not the language of address to the king (according to Hitzig, to Jehoshaphat). The language of prayerful address is retained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>. From the words &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1498; &#1506;&#1500; &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; there is nothing to be transported to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a> (Hupfeld); for <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a> would thereby become stunted. The words together are the statement of the starting-point of the oblations belonging to &#1497;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;: starting from Thy temple, which soars aloft over Jerusalem, may kings bring Thee, who sittest enthroned there in the Holy of holies, tributary gifts (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-12.htm">Psalm 76:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>). In this connection (of prayer) it is the expression of the desire that the Temple may become the zenith or cynosure, and Jerusalem the metropolis, of the world. In this passage, where it introduces the seat of religious worship, the taking of &#1502;&#1503; as expressing the primary cause, "because or on account of Thy Temple" (Ewald), is not to be entertained.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a> follows a summons, which in this instance is only the form in which the prediction clothes itself. The "beast of the reed" is not the lion, of which sojourn among the reeds is not a characteristic (although it makes its home inter arundineta Mesopotamiae, Ammianus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>, and in the thickets of the Jordan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-3.htm">Zechariah 11:3</a>). The reed is in itself an emblem of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>), and it is therefore either the crocodile, the usual emblem of Pharaoh and of the power of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>.) that is meant, or even the hippopotamus (Egyptian p-ehe-mo&#770;ut), which also symbolizes Egypt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a> (which see), and according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-21.htm">Job 40:21</a> is more appropriately than the crocodile (&#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>) called &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;. Egypt appears here as the greatest and most dreaded worldly power. Elohim is to check the haughty ones who exalt themselves over Israel and Israel's God. &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, strong ones, are bulls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>) as an emblem of the kings; and &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; explains itself by the genit. epexeg. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; .gexep: together with (Beth of the accompaniment as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13</a>, and beside the plur. humanus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-15.htm">Jeremiah 41:15</a>) the calves, viz., the peoples, over whom those bulls rule. With the one emblem of Egypt is combined the idea of defiant self-confidence, and with the other the idea of comfortable security (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a>.). That which is brought prominently forward as the consequence of the menace is moulded in keeping with these emblems. &#1502;&#1514;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1505;, which has been explained by Flaminius substantially correctly: ut supplex veniat, is intended to be taken as a part. fut. (according to the Arabic grammar, h&#803;a&#770;l muqaddar, lit., a predisposed condition). It thus comprehensively in the singular (like &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-9.htm">Psalm 8:9</a>) with one stroke depicts thoroughly humbled pride; for &#1512;&#1508;&#1505; (cf. &#1512;&#1502;&#1505;) signifies to stamp, pound, or trample, to knock down, and the Hithpa. either to behave as a trampling one, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm">Proverbs 6:3</a>, or to trample upon one's self, i.e., to cast one's self violently upon the ground. Others explain it as conculcandum se praebere; but such a meaning cannot be shown to exist in the sphere of the Hebrew Hithpael; moreover this "suffering one's self to be trampled upon" does not so well suit the words, which require a more active sense, viz., &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507;cep, in which is expressed the idea that the riches which the Gentiles have hitherto employed in the service of God-opposed worldliness, are no offered to the God of Israel by those who both in outward circumstances and in heart are vanquished (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>; 9). &#1512;&#1509;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; (from &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, confringere) is a piece of uncoined silver, a bar, wedge, or ingot of silver. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512; there is a wide leap from the call &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; to the language of description. This rapid change is also to be found in other instances, and more especially in this dithyrambic Psalm we may readily give up any idea of a change in the pointing, as &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512; (lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;); &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;, as it stands, cannot be imperative (Hitzig), for the final vowel essential to the imperat. Piel is wanting. God hath scattered the peoples delighting in war; war is therefore at an end, and the peace of the world is realized.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-32.htm">Psalm 68:32</a>, the contemplation of the future again takes a different turn: futures follow as the most natural expression of that which is future. The form &#1497;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, more usually found in pause, here stands pathetically at the beginning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, compared with the Arabic chs&#780;m (whence Arab. chas&#780;s&#780;m, a nose, a word erroneously denied by Gesenius), would signify the supercilious, contemptuous (cf. Arab. a&#770;s&#780;ammun, nasutus, as an appellation of a proud person who will put up with nothing). On the other hand, compared with Arab. h&#803;s&#780;m, it would mean the fat ones, inasmuch as this verbal stem (root Arab. h&#803;s&#780;s&#780;, cf. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-12.htm">2 Samuel 22:12</a>), starting from the primary signification "to be pressed together," also signifies "to be compressed, become compact," i.e., to regain one's plumpness, to make flesh and fat, applied, according to the usage of the language, to wasted men and animals. The commonly compared Arab. h&#803;s&#780;&#305;&#770;m, vir magni famulitii, is not at all natural, - a usage which is brought about by the intransitive signification proper to the verb starting from its radical signification, "to become or be angry, to be zealous about any one or anything," inasmuch as the nomen verbale Arab. ha&#803;s&#780;amun signifies in the concrete sense a person, or collectively persons, for whose maintenance, safety, and honour one is keenly solicitous, such as the members of the family, household attendants, servants, neighbours, clients or protgs, guest-friends; also a thing which one ardently seeks, and over the preservation of which one keeps zealous watch (Fleischer). Here there does not appear to be any connecting link whatever in the Arabic which might furnish some hold for the Hebrew; hence it will be more advisable, by comparison of &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1500; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, to understand by &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the resplendent, most distinguished ones, perillustres. The dignitaries of Egypt come to give glory to the God of Israel, and Aethiopia, disheartened by fear before Jahve (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>), causes his hands to run to Elohim, i.e., hastens to stretch them out. Thus it is interpreted by most expositors. But if it is &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;, why is it not also &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;? We reply, the Hebrew style, even in connection with words that stand close beside one another, does not seek to avoid either the enallage generis (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-3.htm">Job 39:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-16.htm">Job 39:16</a>), or the enall. numeri (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a>). But "to cause the hands to run" is a far-fetched and easily misunderstood figure. We may avoid it, if, with Bttcher and Olshausen, we disregard the accentuation and interpret thus, "Cush - his hands cause to hasten, i.e., bring on in haste (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-17.htm">1 Samuel 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a>), to Elohim," viz., propitiating gifts; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; being the predicate to &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;, according to Ges. 146, 3.</body></html>
