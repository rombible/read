It is plainly another fragment of some ancient song quoted, we can hardly doubt, with reference to the return from captivity. “Bashan” and the “depths of the sea” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/9-1.htm" title="I saw the LORD standing on the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that flees of them shall not flee away, and he that escapes of them shall not be delivered.">Amos 9:1-10</a>) may, in the quotation, only stand generally for <span class= "ital">east </span>and <span class= "ital">west, </span>the sea being here the Mediterranean. But most probably the original verse referred to the passage of the Red Sea and the contest with the king of Bashan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/68.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/68-22.htm" title="The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:...">Psalm 68:22-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord said — </span>Purposed within himself, and promised by divers of his prophets, though not in the same words which are here used: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-8.htm" title="And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul your enemy, which sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.">2 Samuel 4:8</a>. <span class="ital">I will bring again from Bashan </span>— I will repeat my ancient favours, and give my people, by David, as great deliverances as I formerly gave them when I saved them from the hand of Og, king of Bashan, who came out against them with all his forces, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-1.htm" title="Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.">Deuteronomy 3:1</a>; a deliverance often mentioned in succeeding parts of Scripture as one of the most eminent. <span class="ital">I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea — </span>I will appear as powerfully for them as I did when I delivered them from the Egyptian army, by giving them a safe passage through the Red sea. <span class="ital">That thy foot may be dipped, </span>&c. — The meaning is, that if the enemies of God’s people should continue to invade and harass them by war, they should be entirely cut off by the sword, and their slaughter be so great, as that the victorious army should be forced to trample on their dead and bloody bodies, and the dogs should satiate themselves by lapping up their blood. The words are the description of a complete victory, and of what happens after a bloody engagement. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>68:22-28 The victories with which God blessed David over the enemies of Israel, are types of Christ's victory, for himself and for all believers.

The kingdom of the Messiah shall be submitted to by all the rulers and learned in the world. The people seem to address the king, ver. 28. But the words are applicable to the Redeemer, to his church, and every true believer.

There may be an allusion here to the victory achieved over Og, king of Bashan, in the time of Moses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33-35</a>. The idea may be that as, at that time, a victory was achieved over a formidable enemy, so in times of similar peril, God would deliver his people, and save them from danger. Or, as Bashan was the remote frontier of the holy land, the meaning may be, that God would bring his people from the remotest borders where they should be scattered. Another meaning is suggested by Professor Alexander, namely, that as the subject referred to in the subsequent verses is the "enemy" of God, the meaning may be that God would bring back his enemies for punishment, even from the remotest borders, when they were endeavoring to escape, and even when they supposed they were safe. The first of these opinions is probably the true one. God would rescue his people, as he had done from the attacks of the mighty king of Bashan; he would deliver them, as he had brought their fathers from the depths of the sea.<p>I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea - The words "my people" are not in the Hebrew, but they seem to be not improperly supplied by the translators. If so, the allusion is to the interposition of God in conducting his people through the Red Sea <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-22.htm">Exodus 14:22</a>; and the idea is, that God would at all times interpose in their behalf, and deliver them from similar dangers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/68.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

But what is the object of the verb <span class="ital">I will bring again</span>? (1) If with A.V. we supply <span class="ital">my people</span>, the meaning will be that God will bring the Israelites back to their own land from all the places in which they have been scattered, in order that they may witness a complete and final triumph over their enemies (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/4-11.htm" title="Now also many nations are gathered against you, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look on Zion....">Micah 4:11-13</a>). This is the interpretation of the Targ., and Delitzsch quotes from the Talmud a touching story which shews that it was current in early times. When, after the destruction of Jerusalem, a number of young and noble captives were being conveyed by ship to Rome, where a fate worse than death awaited them, they all flung themselves from the ship into the sea, trusting to the promise of these words. (2) But the context makes it more natural to supply, as R.V., <span class="ital">them</span>, i.e. the enemies spoken of in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-21.htm" title="But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goes on still in his trespasses.">Psalm 68:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-23.htm" title="That your foot may be dipped in the blood of your enemies, and the tongue of your dogs in the same.">Psalm 68:23</a></span>. Though they hide themselves in the rock fastnesses of Bashan, nay in the very depths of the sea, they shall not escape, but be brought back to suffer a righteous vengeance. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/9-2.htm" title="Though they dig into hell, there shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, there will I bring them down:...">Amos 9:2-3</a>, where Jehovah warns the sinful Israelites that no hidingplace will avail to shelter them from judgement. Bashan may be mentioned with allusion to Og, the depths of the sea with allusion to Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm" title="Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.">Exodus 15:4</a> ff.).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea</span>. Our translators' interpolation of the words, "my people," is unhappy. The psalmist means to represent God as threatening his enemies, not as encouraging his faithful ones. Though his enemies (ver. 21) fly to Bashan and bury themselves in its woods, or though they even hide themselves in the depths of the sea, he will search them out, and "bring them back," that vengeance may be taken on them (see ver. 23). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/68.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This victory of Israel over the kings of the Gentiles gives the poet the joyful assurance that Zion is the inaccessible dwelling-place of Elohim, the God of the heavenly hosts. The mention of Zalmon leads him to mention other mountains. He uses the mountains of Bashan as an emblem of the hostile powers east of Jordan. These stand over against the people of God, as the mighty mountains of Bashan rising in steep, only slightly flattened peaks, to little hill-like Zion. In the land on this side Jordan the limestone and chalk formation with intermingled strata of sandstone predominates; the mountains of Bashan, however, are throughout volcanic, consisting of slag, lava, and more particularly basalt (basanites), which has apparently taken its name from Bashan (Basan).<p>(Note: This is all the more probable as Semitism has no proper word for basalt; in Syria it is called hag'ar aswad, "black stone.")<p>As a basalt range the mountains of Bashan are conspicuous among other creations of God, and are therefore called "the mountain of Elohim:" the basalt rises in the form of a cone with the top lopped off, or even towers aloft like so many columns precipitous and rugged to sharp points; hence the mountains of Bashan are called &#1492;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., a mountain range (for &#1492;&#1512;, as is well known, signifies both the single eminence and the range of summits) of many peaks  equals  a many-peaked mountain; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1503; is an adjective like &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;. With this boldly formed mass of rock so gloomily majestic, giving the impression of antiquity and of invincibleness, when compared with the ranges on the other side of unstable porous limestone and softer formations, more particularly with Zion, it is an emblem of the world and its powers standing over against the people of God as a threatening and seemingly invincible colossus. The poet asks these mountains of Bashan "why," etc.? &#1512;&#1510;&#1491; is explained from the Arabic rs&#803;d, which, in accordance with its root Arab. rs&#803;, signifies to cleave firmly to a place (firmiter inhaesit loco), properly used of a beast of prey couching down and lying in wait for prey, of a hunter on the catch, and of an enemy in ambush; hence then: to lie in wait for, lurk, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, craftily, insidiose (whence ra&#770;s&#803;id, a lier-in-wait, tarras&#803;s&#803;ud, an ambush), here: to regard enviously, invidiose. In Arabic, just as in this instance, it is construed as a direct transitive with an accusative of the object, whereas the original signification would lead one to look for a dative of the object (&#1512;&#1510;&#1491; &#1500;), which does also really occur in the common Arabic. Olewejored is placed by &#1490;&#1489;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, but what follows is not, after all, the answer: "the mountain - Elohim has chosen it as the seat of His throne," but &#1492;&#1492;&#1512; is the object of the interrogative clause: Quare indiviose observatis, montes cacuminosi, hunc montem (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;: that Zion yonder), quem, etc. (an attributive clause after the determinate substantive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-9.htm">Psalm 52:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-50.htm">Psalm 89:50</a>, and many other instances, contrary to the Arabic rule of style). Now for the first time, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>, follows that which is boastfully and defiantly contrasted with the proud mountains: "Jahve will also dwell for ever;" not only that Elohim has chosen Zion as the seat of His throne, it will also continue to be the seat of His throne, Jahve will continue to dwell [there] for ever. Grace is superior to nature, and the church superior to the world, powerful and majestic as this may seem to be. Zion maintains its honour over against the mountains of Bashan.</body></html>
