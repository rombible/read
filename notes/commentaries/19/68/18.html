But although David, in composing this Psalm for the occasion, as is supposed, of removing the ark, might probably, in this part of it, refer in some measure to the ascent of that symbol of the divine presence to the top of mount Zion; yet his expressions are evidently too strong and exalted to be confined to that transaction, or even to have been primarily intended of it. He certainly speaks principally of another and much more important event, typified, indeed, by that ascent of the ark, and the advantages resulting therefrom to the people, but far more glorious in itself, and producing effects of infinitely greater consequence, not only to the Jews, but to the whole human race. He speaks of the ascension of the Messiah into heaven, in consequence of his victory over his and our enemies, obtained by his death and resurrection. And, accordingly, as is well known, his words are so applied by the apostle to the Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>, who, guided as he was, by the Spirit of truth, certainly neither did, not could, mistake the meaning of this divine oracle given forth by the inspiration of the same Spirit. It must, however, be acknowledged, that, having been speaking of victories and conquests in war, he borrows, as it was natural for him to do, his expressions on this subject from the ancient custom of princes and generals of armies, who, after such glorious achievements, were wont to go up into their royal cities in triumphant chariots, being attended by their captive enemies, and afterward to distribute divers gifts to their soldiers and subjects, and sometimes to do some acts of clemency, even to their enemies and rebels, and to receive them into the number of their own people. In allusion to this, he here represents the victorious Captain of our salvation as ascending to his royal city in the heavens, leading his enemies captive, and conferring the most important gifts, privileges, and blessings on his subjects, and even on such as had been rebels against his government. <span class="ital">Thou hast led captivity captive — </span>That is, either those who did formerly take thy people captive, or rather, those whom thou hadst taken captive, as this expression is most commonly used. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-10.htm" title="When you go forth to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God has delivered them into your hands, and you have taken them captive,">Deuteronomy 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-12.htm" title="Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam.">Jdg 5:12</a>.

This is meant of Satan, sin and death, and of all the enemies of Christ and his people, whom he led in triumph, having spoiled them, and making a show of them openly, as is expressed <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>. <span class="ital">Thou hast received gifts for men — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">באדם</span>; <span class="greekheb">εν ανθρωπω</span>, <span class="ital">in the man, </span>as the LXX. render it, that is, in the human nature, wherewith thou wast pleased to clothe thyself, that thou mightest be <span class="ital">a merciful and faithful High-Priest in things pertaining to God. </span>Not in thy Godhead; but according to thy manhood, thou hast received from God all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and all those gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit which are necessary, either to the perfection of thy nature, or the good of thy church and people; or, <span class="ital">for men; </span>not for angels; “fallen angels were not to be made saints,” says Henry, “nor standing angels ministers. Not for Jews only, but for all men; whosoever will may reap the benefit of these gifts.” The apostle, in the reference which he makes to these words, names some of these gifts: they were <span class="ital">prophets, apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers; </span>namely, the institution of a gospel ministry, and the qualification of men for it, both which are to be valued as the gifts of God, and the fruits of Christ’s ascension. The apostle reads it, <span class="ital">he gave gifts to men. </span>For he received that he might give them. And some of the best critics have observed, that in the Hebrew idiom, to <span class="ital">take gifts for another, </span>is the same as to <span class="ital">give them to another: </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-24.htm" title="And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.">1 Kings 3:24</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm" title="And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are you come to your servant. And they said, So do, as you have said.">Genesis 18:5</a>, in the Hebrew. The anointing of the Spirit was poured on his head, that it might descend to the skirts of his garments, to the lowest and meanest members of his mystical body. <span class="ital">Yea, for the rebellious also —</span> For those that had been rebellious, who had not only broken his laws, but appeared in arms against him; even for his most stubborn and determined enemies, whether Jews or Gentiles; for those who crucified him and put him to open shame. Even for these, as well as others, he received, and to these he gave those saving gifts and graces; and of such as these, converted by the power of his gospel, he formed and established a holy church; <span class="ital">that the Lord God might dwell among them — </span>That having received such gifts and graces, and thereby being made fit habitations for God, he, who as man is ascended into the highest heavens, might, as God, come down to them and abide with them, not only in and by his ordinances, in which he is present, but by his Spirit dwelling in their hearts.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>68:15-21 The ascension of Christ must here be meant, and thereto it is applied, Eph 4:8. He received as the purchase of his death, the gifts needful for the conversion of sinners, and the salvation of believers. These he continually bestows, even on rebellious men, that the Lord God might dwell among them, as their Friend and Father. He gave gifts to men. Having received power to give eternal life, the Lord Jesus bestows it on as many as were given him, Joh 17:2. Christ came to a rebellious world, not to condemn it, but that through him it might be saved. The glory of Zion's King is, that he is a Saviour and Benefactor to all his willing people, and a consuming fire to all that persist in rebellion against him. So many, so weighty are the gifts of God's bounty, that he may be truly said to load us with them. He will not put us off with present things for a portion, but will be the God of our salvation. The Lord Jesus has authority and power to rescue his people from the dominion of death, by taking away the sting of it from them when they die, and giving them complete victory over it when they rise again. The crown of the head, the chief pride and glory of the enemy, shall be smitten; Christ shall crush the head of the serpent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/68.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast ascended on high - That is, Thou hast gone up to the high place; to thy throne; to thine abode. The idea is, that God had descended or come down from his dwelling-place in the case referred to in the psalm, and that having now secured a victory by vanquishing his foes, and having given deliverance to his people, he had now returned, or reascended to his seat. This may either mean his throne on earth, or his abode in heaven. It would seem most probable that the latter is the idea.<p>Thou hast led captivity captive - "Thou hast made captivity captive," or "Thou hast captured a captivity." The main idea is, that he had achieved a complete victory; he had led all his foes captive. The language "would" also express the idea that he had made captives for himself of those who were captives to others, or who were in subjection to another. As applied in the Christian sense, this would refer to those who were captives to Satan, and who were held in bondage by him, but who had been rescued by the Redeemer, and brought under another captivity - the yielding of voluntary service to himself. Those once captives to sin were now led by him, captives in a higher sense. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>.<p>Thou hast received gifts for men - Margin, "in the man." That is, "Among men," or while among them as a conqueror. The idea here most naturally conveyed would be, that he had obtained "gifts," privileges, advantages, "in" man; that is, that men, considered as captives, constituted the victory which he had achieved - the advantage which he had acquired. It was not so much "for" them as "in" them, and "by" them, to wit, by possessing them as captives or subjects to him. With this victory achieved, he had now ascended on high.<p>Yea, for the rebellious also - Or, more properly, "even the rebellious." That is, Those who had been in a state of rebellion he had subdued to himself, and had thus led captivity captive. It was a triumph by which they had become subdued to him.<p>That the Lord God might dwell among them - literally, "For the dwelling of Jah, God." The idea is, that he had achieved such a triumph; he had so brought the rebellious under subjection to himself, that he could take up his abode with them, or dwell with them as his people. His rule could be extended over them, and they would acknowledge him as their sovereign. This would be applicable to a people in ancient times that had been subdued by the people of God. It might now be properly applied, also, to sinners who by the power of truth have been so subdued as to submit to God. It is applicable to all who have been conquered by the Gospel - whose enmity has been slain - who have been changed from enemies to friends - so that the Lord may dwell in their hearts, or rule over them. This passage is applied by the apostle Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a> to the Messiah, not as having original reference to him, but as suggesting language which would appropriately express the nature of his work, and the glory of his triumph. See the notes at that place. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/68.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. From the scene of conquest He ascends to His throne, leading&#8212;<p>captivity captive&#8212;or, "many captives captive" (Jud 5:12).<p>received gifts for men&#8212;accepting their homage, even when forced, as that of rebels.<p>that the Lord God might dwell&#8212;or literally, "to dwell, O Lord God" (compare Ps 68:16)&#8212;that is, to make this hill, His people or Church, His dwelling. This Psalm typifies the conquests of the Church under her divine leader, Christ. He, indeed, "who was with the Church in the wilderness" (Ac 7:38) is the Lord, described in this ideal ascension. Hence Paul (Eph 4:8) applies this language to describe His real ascension, when, having conquered sin, death, and hell, the Lord of glory triumphantly entered heaven, attended by throngs of adoring angels, to sit on the throne and wield the scepter of an eternal dominion. The phrase "received gifts for (or literally, among) men" is by Paul, "gave gifts to men." Both describe the acts of a conqueror, who receives and distributes spoils. The Psalmist uses "receiving" as evincing the success, Paul "gave" as the act, of the conqueror, who, having subdued his enemies, proceeds to reward his friends. The special application of the passage by Paul was in proof of Christ's exaltation. What the Old Testament represents of His descending and ascending corresponds with His history. He who descended is the same who has ascended. As then ascension was an element of His triumph, so is it now; and He, who, in His humiliation, must be recognized as our vicarious sacrifice and the High Priest of our profession, must also be adored as Head of His Church and author of all her spiritual benefits.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast ascended on high; </span> having spoken of the Lord, and of his presence upon earth, he now turneth his speech to him, as is most usual in this book.

But (see note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-6.htm" title="God sets the solitary in families: he brings out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.">Psalm 68:6</a></span>) the term is generally applied to the Israelites; and the line may be rendered, Yea, even the stubborn (are content) to dwell with Jah Elohim. Even the successors (in spirit) of the stubborn and rebellious generation of the wilderness are subdued when they see Jehovah’s triumphs, and are content to become His obedient subjects. For construction and thought cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-4.htm" title="For you are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with you.">Psalm 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-14.htm" title="The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?">Isaiah 33:14</a>. Another alternative is to take <span class="ital">Jah</span> as the subject of the infin., Yea, even the stubborn (are content) that Jah Elohim should dwell (among them). Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm" title="So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;">Psalm 78:60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-8.htm" title="And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.">Exodus 25:8</a>; &c. So apparently the LXX.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St Paul quotes this verse in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a> in the form, “Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,” applying it to the spiritual gifts showered upon the Church by the risen and ascended Christ. How came he to substitute “gave gifts unto men” for “received gifts among men”? The Targum paraphrases the verse thus; “Thou didst ascend to the firmament, O prophet Moses! thou didst lead captivity captive; thou didst teach the words of the law; thou didst give gifts to the sons of men.” Similarly the Syriac, which may have been influenced by Jewish exegesis, has, “Thou didst give gifts to the sons of men.” Now though the Targum in its present form is much later than St Paul’s time, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the oral paraphrase then current already interpreted the verse in this way, and St Paul quotes it in the form familiar to him, without pausing to think whether it was an exact rendering of the original or not. But though the quotation is not verbally exact it is deeply significant. The triumph of Jehovah over the enemies of Israel prefigured the triumph of Christ over the spiritual enemies of the Church: or rather may we not say more truly that they are both parts of the same divine plan of redemption working first in the natural and then in the spiritual order? Christ ascended up to heaven, leading the defeated powers of evil in triumph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>). There He performs a yet more royal function than receiving gifts from men, (though of course it would be also true to say that He receives gifts); He bestows them. Spiritual victory corresponds to temporal: the bestowal of gifts of grace to the reception of gifts of homage.

Moreover the transition to the language of address in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a> shows that the poet here looks forth from his present time and circumstances into the future; and the introduction of the divine name &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, after Elohim has been used eleven times, is an indication of a new commencement. The prosperous condition in which God places His church by giving it the hostile powers of the world as a spoil is depicted. The noun &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, never occurring in the genitival relationship, and never with a suffix, because the specific character of the form would be thereby obliterated, always denotes an important utterance, more particularly God's word of promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-9.htm">Psalm 77:9</a>), or His word of power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>), which is represented elsewhere as a mighty voice of thunder (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>), or a trumpet-blast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>); in the present instance it is the word of power by which the Lord suddenly changes the condition of His oppressed church. The entirely new state of things which this omnipotent behest as it were conjures into existence is presented to the mind in v. 12b: the women who proclaim the tidings of victory - a great host. Victory and triumph follow upon God's &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, as upon His creative &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;. The deliverance of Israel from the army of Pharaoh, the deliverance out of the hand of Jabin by the defeat of Sisera, the victory of Jephthah over the Ammonites, and the victorious single combat of David with Goliath were celebrated by singing women. God's decisive word shall also go forth this time, and of the evangelists, like Miriam (Mirjam) and Deborah, there shall be a great host.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a> describes the subject of this triumphant exultation. Hupfeld regards <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13-15</a> as the song of victory itself, the fragment of an ancient triumphal ode (epinikion) reproduced here; but there is nothing standing in the way that should forbid our here regarding these verses as a direct continuation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a>. The "hosts" are the numerous well-equipped armies which the kings of the heathen lead forth to the battle against the people of God. The unusual expression "kings of hosts" sounds very much like an ironically disparaging antithesis to the customary "Jahve of Hosts" (Bttcher). He, the Lord, interposes, and they are obliged to flee, staggering as they go, to retreat, and that, as the anadiplosis (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-7.htm">Judges 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-20.htm">Judges 19:20</a>) depicts, far away, in every direction. The fut. energicum with its ultima-accentuation gives intensity to the pictorial expression. The victors then turn homewards laden with rich spoils. &#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, here in a collective sense, is the wife who stays at home (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-24.htm">Judges 5:24</a>) while the husband goes forth to battle. It is not: the ornament (&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-2.htm">Jeremiah 6:2</a>) of the house, which Luther, with the lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac, adopts in his version, <p>(Note: "Hausehre," says he, is the housewife or matron as being the adornment of the house; vid., F. Dietrich, Frau und Dame, a lecture bearing upon the history of language (1864), S. 13.)<p>but: the dweller or homely one (cf. &#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, a dwelling-lace, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-6.htm">Job 8:6</a>) of the house, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. The dividing of the spoil elsewhere belongs to the victors; what is meant here is the distribution of the portions of the spoil that have fallen to the individual victors, the further distribution of which is left for the housewife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>). Ewald now recognises in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>. the words of an ancient song of victory; but v. 13b is unsuitable to introduce them. The language of address in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a> is the poet's own, and he here describes the condition of the people who are victorious by the help of their God, and who again dwell peaceably in the land after the war. &#1488;&#1501; passes out of the hypothetical signification into the temporal, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a> (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a>). The lying down among the sheep-folds (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, the staked-in folds or pens consisting of hurdles standing two by two over against one another) is an emblem of thriving peace, which (like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>) points back to Deborah's song, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-14.htm">Genesis 49:14</a>. Just such a time is now also before Israel, a time of peaceful prosperity enhanced by rich spoils. Everything shall glitter and gleam with silver and gold. Israel is God's turtle-dove, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a>. Hence the new circumstances of ease and comfort are likened to the varied hues of a dove disporting itself in the sun. Its wings are as though overlaid with silver (&#1504;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, not 3. praet, but part. fem. Niph. as predicate to &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-15.htm">1 Samuel 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>; Ew. 317 a), therefore like silver wings (cf. Ovid, Metam. ii.:537: Niveis argentea pennis Ales); and its pinions with gold-green,  <p>(Note: Ewald remarks, "Arabian poets also call the dove Arab. 'l-wrq'a&#770;, the greenish yellow, golden gleaming one, vid., Kosegarten, Chrestom. p. 156, 5." But this Arabic poetical word for the dove signifies rather the ash-green, whity blackish one. Nevertheless the signification greenish for the Hebrew &#1497;&#1512;&#1511;&#1512;&#1511; is established. Bartenoro, on Negaim xi. 4, calls the colour of the wings of the peacock &#1497;&#1512;&#1511;&#1512;&#1511;; and I am here reminded of what Wetzstein once told me, that, according to an Arab proverb, the surface of good coffee ought to be "like the neck of the dove," i.e., so oily that it gleams like the eye of a peacock. A way for the transition from green to grey in aurak as the name of a colour is already, however, opened up in post-biblical Hebrew, when to frighten any one is expressed by &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;, Genesis Rabba, 47a. The intermediate notions that of fawn colour, i.e., yellowish grey. In the Talmud the plumage of the full-grown dove is called &#1494;&#1492;&#1493;&#1489; and &#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1489;, Chullin, 22b.)<p>and that, as the reduplicated form implies, with the iridescent or glistening hue of the finest gold (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, not dull, but shining gold).<p>Side by side with this bold simile there appears in v. 15 an equally bold but contrastive figure, which, turning a step or two backward, likewise vividly illustrates the results of their God-given victory. The suffix of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers to the land of Israel, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-9.htm">Isaiah 65:9</a>. &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1501;, according to the usage of the language so far as it is now preserved to us, is not a common noun: deep darkness (Targum  equals  &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;), it is the name of a mountain in Ephraim, the trees of which Abimelech transported in order to set fire to the tower of Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-48.htm">Judges 9:48</a>.). The Talmudic literature was acquainted with a river taking its rise there, and also somewhat frequently mentions a locality bearing a similar name to that of the mountain. The mention of this mountain may in a general way be rendered intelligible by the consideration that, like Shiloh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), it is situated about in the centre of the Holy Land.<p>(Note: In Tosifta Para, ch. viii., a river of the name of &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514; &#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is mentioned, the waters of which might not be used in preparing the water of expiation (&#1502;&#1497; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;), because they were dried up at the time of the war, and thereby hastened the defeat of Israel (viz., the overthrow of Barcochba). Grtz "Geschichte der Juden, iv. 157, 459f.) sees in it the Nahar Arsuf, which flows down the mountains of Ephraim past Bethar into the Mediterranean. The village of Zalmon occurs in the Mishna, Jebamoth xvi. 6, and frequently. The Jerusalem Gemara (Maaseroth i. 1) gives pre-eminence to the carob-trees of Zalmona side by side with those of Shitta and Gadara.) <p>&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490; signifies to bring forth snow, or even, like Arab. at&#817;lj, to become snow-white; this Hiph. is not a word descriptive of colour, like &#1492;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;. Since the protasis is &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, and not &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1490; is intended to be impersonal (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-3.htm">Psalm 50:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/4-7.htm">Amos 4:7</a>, Mich. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>); and the voluntative form is explained from its use in apodoses of hypothetical protases (Ges. 128, 2). It indicates the issue to which, on the supposition of the other, it must and shall come. The words are therefore to be rendered: then it snows on Zalmon; and the snowing is either an emblem of the glistening spoil that falls into their hands in such abundance, or it is a figure of the becoming white, whether from bleached bones (cf. Virgil, Aen. v. 865: albi ossibus scopuli; xii. 36: campi ossibus albent; Ovid, Fasti i.:558: humanis ossibus albet humus) or even from the naked corpses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;). Whether we consider the point of comparison to lie in the spoil being abundant as the flakes of snow, and like to the dazzling snow in brilliancy, or in the white pallid corpses, at any rate &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is not equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, but what follows "when the Almighty scatters kings therein" is illustrated by Zalmon itself. In the one case Zalmon is represented as the battle-ground (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-6.htm">Psalm 110:6</a>), in the other (which better corresponds to the nature of a wooded mountain) as a place of concealment. The protasis &#1489;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; favours the latter; for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; signifies to spread wide apart, to cause a compact whole - and the host of "the kings" is conceived of as such - to fly far asunder into many parts (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-10.htm">Zechariah 2:10</a>, cf. the Niph. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-21.htm">Ezekiel 17:21</a>). The hostile host disperses in all directions, and Zalmon glitters, as it were with snow, from the spoil that is dropped by those who flee. Homer also (Iliad, xix. 357-361) likens the mass of assembled helmets, shields, armour, and lances to the spectacle of a dense fall of snow. In this passage of the Psalm before us still more than in Homer it is the spectacle of the fallen and far seen glistening snow that also is brought into the comparison, and not merely that which is falling and that which covers everything (vid., Iliad, xii. 277ff.). The figure is the pendant of the figure of the dove.<p>(Note: Wetzstein gives a different explanation (Reise in den beiden Trachonen und um das Haura equals ngebirge in the Zeitscheift fr allgem. Erdkunde, 1859, S. 198). "Then fell snow on Zalmon, i.e., the mountain clothed itself in a bright garment of light in celebration of this joyous event. Any one who has been in Palestine knows how very refreshing is the spectacle of the distant mountain-top capped with snow. The beauty of this poetical figure is enhanced by the fact that Zalmon (Arab. d&#817;lma&#770;n), according to its etymology, signifies a mountain range dark and dusky, either from shade, forest, or black rock. The last would well suit the mountains of Haurn, among which Ptolemaeus (p. 365 and 370, Ed. Wilberg) mentions a mountain (according to one of the various readings) &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;.") </body></html>
