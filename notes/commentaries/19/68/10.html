But, retaining the proper signification of the word, the clause may be rendered, as it is by the LXX., <span class="greekheb">τα ζωα σου</span>, <span class="ital">thy living creatures, </span>or <span class="ital">thy flock, </span>that is, thy people, the sheep of thy pasture, <span class="ital">hath dwelt therein, </span><span class="greekheb">ישׁבו בה</span>, <span class="ital">jashebu bah, have dwelt in it, </span>namely, in the inheritance mentioned in the preceding verse, to which the preposition, with the feminine affix, <span class="greekheb">בה</span>, <span class="ital">in it, </span>can only properly refer. God often compares himself to a <span class="ital">shepherd, </span>and his people to <span class="ital">sheep; </span>and he is particularly said to have <span class="ital">led his people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm" title="You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.">Psalm 77:20</a>, namely, in the wilderness; and consequently he may be here said to have brought his sheep into, and to have made them dwell in, Canaan, as in a green and good pasture; see Psalms 23., where God speaks of his people under this very metaphor. This interpretation, evidently adopted by our translators, seems much more easy and natural, and more agreeable to the Hebrew text, than that of Dr. Chandler and some others, who would render the word above mentioned, (which we translate <span class="ital">thy flock, </span>or <span class="ital">thy congregation,</span>) <span class="ital">thy food, </span>or the support of thy life; and who thus interpret the clause: <span class="ital">thy food, </span>or, <span class="ital">as to thy food, </span>the food which thou, O God, gavest them, <span class="ital">they dwelt in the midst of it: </span>which is surely a very unnatural and forced exposition. <span class="ital">Thou hast prepared of thy goodness, </span>&c. — Dr. Chandler, in consistency with his above-mentioned interpretation of the preceding clause, understands this of the provision made miraculously by God for his people in the wilderness: but, according to our translation, it speaks of the provision made for them in Canaan; the good land which God <span class="ital">prepared </span>for his people, by expelling the old inhabitants, sending frequently refreshing and fertilizing rains upon it, making it fruitful by his special blessing, and furnishing it with all sorts of provisions: and all this <span class="ital">of his goodness, </span>that is, by his free, unmerited, and singular goodness: and that both as to the <span class="ital">cause </span>and <span class="ital">measure </span>of this preparation. God did it; not for their righteousness, as he often told them, but of his mere mercy; and he increased the fruits of the earth very wonderfully, that they might be sufficient for the supply of such a numerous people, which, without his extraordinary blessing, would not have been the case, as appears by the state of that land at this day, which is well known to be very barren. <span class="ital">For the poor — </span>Thy people of Israel, whom he calls poor, partly to repress that pride and arrogance to which they were exceedingly prone, and to remind them of their entire dependance on God for all they had or hoped for; and partly because they really were poor when God undertook the conduct of them into Canaan, and such they would have been still if God had not provided for them in a singular manner.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>68:7-14 Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies. If God bring his people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be as the wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold. Full salvation will render those white as snow, who were vile and loathsome through the guilt and defilement of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/68.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy congregation hath dwelt therein - In the land of promise; for the connection requires us to understand it in this manner.

That is, in the Lord's inheritance, in the midst of his church and people. The word for "congregation" signifies "beasts" or "living creatures" (w): some understand them of the Gentiles, who, before the Gospel came among them, were comparable to such; but, under the Gospel dispensation, being called and taken out by it, were put among the people of God, and dwelt in his inheritance. Though, without any limitation, it may be applied to all that are quickened and made alive by the grace of God; to all that are written among the living in Jerusalem; and particularly to the ministers of the Gospel, who are signified by the four living creatures, in Ezekiel's vision and in John's Revelation; though not to the exclusion of any living believer, who has a name and a place here, and who are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God: <p>thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor; blessings of goodness, spiritual blessings, blessings of grace and of glory; which flow from divine goodness, are in themselves good, and in their effects; and these were prepared in the covenant of grace and in Christ from all eternity; and that for persons poor and mean, indigent and helpless; and so the goodness of God in preparing them appears to he free and unmerited.

Ewald and Hitzig take &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; hypothetically: If God arise, He enemies will be scattered. This rendering is possible in itself so far as the syntax is concerned, but here everything conspires against it; for the futures in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-4</a> form an unbroken chain; then a glance at the course of the Psalm from Psa 68:20 onwards shows that the circumstances of Israel, under which the poet writes, urged forth the wish: let God arise and humble His foes; and finally the primary passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>, makes it clear that the futures are the language of prayer transformed into the form of the wish. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a> the wish is addressed directly to God Himself, and therefore becomes petition. &#1492;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; is inflected (as vice vers&#1490; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>, from &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;) from &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1491;&#1507; (like &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>); it is a violation of all rule in favour of the conformity of sound (cf. &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-43.htm">Leviticus 14:43</a>, and supra on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) with &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;, the object of which is easily supplied (dispellas, sc. hostes tuos), and is purposely omitted in order to direct attention more stedfastly to the omnipotence which to every creature is so irresistible. Like smoke, wax (&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1490;, root &#1491;&#1490;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;, Sanscrit tak, to shoot past, to run, Zend tak&#769;, whence vitak&#769;ina, dissolving, Neo-Persic guda&#770;chten; causative: to cause to run in different directions  equals  to melt or smelt) is an emblem of human feebleness. As Bakiuds observes, Si creatura creaturam non fert, quomodo creatura creatoris indignantis faciem ferre possit? The wish expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-4.htm">Psalm 68:4</a> forms the obverse of the preceding. The expressions for joy are heaped up in order to describe the transcendency of the joy that will follow the release from the yoke of the enemy. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is expressively used in alternation with &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a> : by the wrathful action, so to speak, that proceeds from His countenance just as the heat radiating from the fire melts the wax the foes are dispersed, whereas the righteous rejoice before His gracious countenance.<p>As the result of the challenge that has been now expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-4</a>, Elohim, going before His people, begins His march; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a> an appeal is made to praise Him with song, His name with the music of stringed instrument, and to make a way along which He may ride &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;. In view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a> we cannot take &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as do the Targum and Talmud (B. Chagiga 12b), as a name of one of the seven heavens, a meaning to which, apart from other considerations, the verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, to be effaced, confused, dark, is not an appropriate stem-word; but it must be explained according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. There Jahve calls in the aid of His people, here He goes forth at the head of His people; He rides through the steppes in order to right against the enemies of His people. Not merely the historical reference assigned to the Psalm by Hitzig, but also the one adopted by ourselves, admits of allusion being made to the "steppes of Moab;" for the way to Mdeb, where the Syrian mercenaries of the Ammonites had encamped (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>), lay through these steppes, and also the way to Rabbath Ammon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7</a>.). &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; calls upon them to make a way for Him, the glorious, invincible King (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>); &#1505;&#1500;&#1500; signifies to cast up, heap up or pave, viz., a raised and suitable street or highway, Symmachus katastroo'sate. He who thus rides along makes the salvation of His people His aim: " is His name, therefore shout with joy before Him." The Beth in &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; (Symmachus, Quinta: &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b1;) is the Beth essentiae, which here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>, stands beside the subject: His name is (exists) in &#1497;&#1492;, i.e., His essential name is yh, His self-attestation, by which He makes Himself capable of being known and named, consists in His being the God of salvation, who, in the might of free grace, pervades all history. This Name is a fountain of exultant rejoicing to His people.<p>This Name is exemplificatively unfolded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>. The highly exalted One, who sits enthroned in the heaven of glory, rules in all history here below and takes an interest in the lowliest more especially, in all circumstances of their lives following after His own to succour them. He takes the place of a father to the orphan. He takes up the cause of the widow and contests it to a successful issue. Elohim is one who makes the solitary or isolated to dwell in the house; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; with He locale, which just as well answers the question where? as whither? &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, a house  equals  family bond, is the opposite of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;, solitarius, recluse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>. Dachselt correctly renders it, in domum, h.e. familiam numerosam durabilemque eos ut patres-familias plantabit. He is further One who brings forth (out of the dungeon and out of captivity) those who are chained into abundance of prosperity. &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, occurring only here, is a pluralet. from &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; morf .tela, synonym &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight, fortunate. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a> briefly and sharply expresses the reverse side of this His humanely condescending rule among mankind. &#1488;&#1498; is here (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>) restrictive or adversative (as is more frequently the case with &#1488;&#1499;&#1503;); and the preterite is the preterite of that which is an actual matter of experience.
