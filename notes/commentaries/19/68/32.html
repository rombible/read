Happy are men that God is one who is consistently the object of joyous worship, for not such are the demons of the heathen. So sweet a thing is song that it ought to be all the Lord's; a secular concert seems almost a sacrilege, a licentious song is treason. "O sing praises unto the Lord." Again and again is God to be magnified; we have too much sinning against God, but cannot have too much singing to God. "Selah." Well may we rest now that our contemplations have reached the millennial glory. What heart will refuse to be lifted up by such a prospect!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-33.htm">Psalm 68:33</a><p>"To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old." Before, he was described in his earthly manifestations, as marching through the desert; now, in his celestial glory, as riding in the heavens of the primeval ages. Long ere this heaven and earth were made, the loftier abodes of the Deity stood fast; before men or angels were created, the splendours of the Great King were as great as now, and his triumphs as glorious. Our knowledge reaches but to a small fragment of the life of God, whose "goings forth were of old, even from everlasting." Well might the Jewish church hymn the eternal God, and well may we join therewith the adoration of the Great Firstborn: - <p>"Ere sin was born, or Satan fell,<p>He led the host of morning stars.<p>Thy generation who can tell?<p>Or count the number of thy years?"<p>"Lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice." Was there a thunder-clap just then heard in heaven? Or did the poet's mind flash backward to the time when from the heaven of heavens the voice of Jehovah broke the long silence and said, "Light be," and light was. To this hour, the voice of God is power. This gospel, which utters and reveals his word, is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. Our voices are fitly called to praise him whose voice spoke us into being, and gives us the effectual grace which secures our well-being.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not only Egypt and Ethiopia, but other kingdoms and nations also, who shall partake of the same grace with them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/68.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth,....

Comforted by the majestic picture of the future that he has beheld, the poet returns to the present, in which Israel is still oppressed, but yet not forsaken by God. The translation follows the accentuation, regular and in accordance with the sense, which has been restored by Baer after Heidenheim, viz., &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; has Zarka, and &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1505; &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; Olewejored preceded by the sub-distinctive Rebia parvum; it is therefore: Benedictus Dominator: quotidie bajulat nobis, - with which the Targum, Rashi, and Kimchi agree.<p>(Note: According to the customary accentuation the second &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; has Mercha or Olewejored, and &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1505;&#1470;&#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, Mugrash. But this Mugrash has the position of the accents of the Silluk-member against it; for although it does exceptionally occur that two conjunctives follow Mugrash (Accentsystem, xvii. 5), yet these cannot in any case be Mahpach sarkatum and Illui.)<p>&#1506;&#1502;&#1505;, like &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; and &#1505;&#1489;&#1500;, unites the significations to lay a burden upon one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-3.htm">Zechariah 12:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>), and to carry a burden; with &#1506;&#1500; it signifies to lay a burden upon any one, here with &#1500; to take up a burden for any one and to bear it for him. It is the burden or pressure of the hostile world that is meant, which the Lord day by day helps His church to bear, inasmuch as He is mighty by His strength in her who of herself is so feeble. The divine name &#1488;&#1500;, as being the subject of the sentence, is &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;: God is our salvation. The music here again strikes in forte, and the same thought that is emphasized by the music in its turn, is also repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-21.htm">Psalm 68:21</a> with heightened expression: God is to us a God &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, who grants us help in rich abundance. The pluralet. denotes not so much the many single proofs of help, as the riches of rescuing power and grace. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-21.htm">Psalm 68:21</a> &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; corresponds to the &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; for it is not to be construed &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;: Jahve's, the Lord, are the outgoings to death (Bttcher), i.e., He can command that one shall not fall a prey to death. &#1514;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, the parallel word to &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, signifies, and it is the most natural meaning, the escapings; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, evadere, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:18</a>. In Jahve's power are means of deliverance for death, i.e., even for those who are already abandoned to death. With &#1488;&#1498; a joyously assuring inference is drawn from that which God is to Israel. The parallelism of the correctly divided verse shows that &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-6.htm">Psalm 110:6</a>, signifies caput in the literal sense, and not in the sense of princeps. The hair-covered scalp is mentioned as a token of arrogant strength, and unhumbled and impenitent pride, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-42.htm">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>, and as the Attic koma'n directly signifies to strut along, give one's self airs. The genitival construction is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a>. The form of expression refers back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, and so to speak inflects this primary passage very similarly to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>. If &#1511;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491; &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512; be an object, then &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; ought also to be a second object (that of the member of the body); the order of the words does not in itself forbid this (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-11.htm">Deuteronomy 33:11</a>), but would require a different arrangement in order to avoid ambiguities.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-23.htm">Psalm 68:23</a> the poet hears a divine utterance, or records one that he has heard: "From Bashan will I bring back, I will bring back from the eddies of the sea (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;, to whiz, rattle; to whirl, eddy), i.e., the depths or abysses of the sea." Whom? When after the destruction of Jerusalem a ship set sail for Rome with a freight of distinguished and well-formed captives before whom was the disgrace of prostitution, they all threw themselves into the sea, comforting themselves with this passage of Scripture (Gittin 57b, cf. Echa Rabbathi 66a). They therefore took <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-23.htm">Psalm 68:23</a> to be a promise which has Israel as its object; <p>(Note: So also the Targum, which understands the promise to refer to the restoration of the righteous who have been eaten by wild beasts and drowned in the sea (Midrash: &#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;); cf. also the things related from the time of the Khaliphs in Jost's Geschichte des Judenthums, ii. 399, and Grtz' Gesch. der Juden, v. 347.)<p>but the clause expressing a purpose, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a>, and the paraphrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2</a>., show that the foes of Israel are conceived of as its object. Even if these have hidden themselves in the most out-of-the-way places, God will fetch them back and make His own people the executioners of His justice upon them. The expectation is that the flight of the defeated foes will take a southernly direction, and that they will hide themselves in the primeval forests of Bashan, and still farther southward in the depths of the sea, i.e., of the Dead Sea (&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>). Opposite to the hiding in the forests of the mountainous Bashan stands the hiding in the abyss of the sea, as the extreme of remoteness, that which is in itself impossible being assumed as possible. The first member of the clause expressing the purpose, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a>, becomes more easy and pleasing if we read &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1509; (lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate, ut intingatur), according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-11.htm">Psalm 58:11</a>. So far as the letters are concerned, the conjecture &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1509; (from which &#1514;&#1502;&#1495;&#1509;, according to Chajug', is transposed), after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>, is still more natural (Hitzig): that thy foot may redden itself in blood. This is certainly somewhat tame, and moreover &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; would be better suited to this rendering than &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1501;. As the text now stands, &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1509;<p>(Note: The Gaja of the first closed syllable warns one to make a proper pause upon it, in order that the guttural of the second, so apt to be slurred over, may be distinctly pronounced; cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>; &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>. So also with the sibilants at the beginning of the second syllable, e.g., &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>, in accordance with which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/53-2.htm">Genesis 53:2</a>, we must write &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;.)<p>is equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1501; (them, viz., the enemies), and &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1501; is an adverbial clause (setting or plunging thy foot in blood). It is, however, also possible that &#1502;&#1495;&#1509; is used like Arab. machad&#803;a (vehementer commovere): ut concutias s. agites pedem tuam in sanguine. Can it now be that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a> from among the number of the enemies of the one who goes about glorying in his sins, the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>, and other passages), is brought prominently forward by &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;? Hardly so; the absence of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1511; (lambat) cannot be tolerated, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a>. It is more natural, with Simonis, to refer &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; back to &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (a word which is usually fem., but sometimes perhaps is masc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a>); and, since side by side with &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; only &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; occurs anywhere else (Ew. 263, b), to take it in the signification pars ejus (&#1502;&#1503; from &#1502;&#1504;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1490;&#1492;, after the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;, &#1495;&#1503;, &#1511;&#1509;, of the same meaning as &#1502;&#1490;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1504;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>), in favour of which Hupfeld also decides.<p>What is now described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25-28</a>, is not the rejoicing over a victory gained in the immediate past, nor the rejoicing over the earlier deliverance at the Red Sea, but Israel's joyful celebration when it shall have experienced the avenging and redemptive work of its God and King. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>, &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; appears to be God's march against the enemy; but what follows shows that the pompa magnifica of God is intended, after He has overcome the enemy. Israel's festival of victory is looked upon as a triumphal procession of God Himself, the King, who governs in holiness, and has now subjugated and humbled the unholy world; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>. The rendering "in the sanctuary' is very natural in this passage, but <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>, are against it. The subject of &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is all the world, more especially those of the heathen who have escaped the slaughter. The perfect signifies: they have seen, just as &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, they have occupied the front position. Singers head the procession, after them (&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;,<p>(Note: This &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, according to B. Nedarim 37b, is a so-called &#1506;&#1496;&#1493;&#1512; &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (ablatio scribarum), the sopherim (sofrim) who watched over the faithful preservation of the text having removed the reading &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, so natural according to the sense, here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-2.htm">Numbers 31:2</a>, and marked it as not genuine.)<p>an adverb as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>) players upon citherns and harps (&#1504;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, participle to &#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503;), and on either side virgins with timbrels (Spanish adufe); &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;, apocopated part. Poel with the retension of e&#772; (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1511;&#1511;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-9.htm">Psalm 107:9</a>), from &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1507;, to strike the &#1514;&#1468;&#1507; (Arab. duff). It is a retrospective reference to the song at the Sea, now again come into life, which Miriam and the women of Israel sang amidst the music of timbrels. The deliverance which is now being celebrated is the counterpart of the deliverance out of Egypt. Songs resound as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a>, "in gatherings of the congregation (and, so to speak, in full choirs) praise ye Elohim." &#1502;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; (&#1502;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-12.htm">Psalm 26:12</a>) is the plural to &#1511;&#1492;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>), which forms none of its own (cf. post-biblical &#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;). <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a> is abridged from &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493; &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; &#1502;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;, praise ye the Lord, ye who have Israel for your fountainhead. &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, in accordance with the sense, has Mugrash. Israel is here the name of the patriarch, from whom as from its fountainhead the nation has spread itself abroad; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>, and as to the syntax &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498;, those who descend from thee, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>. In the festive assembly all the tribes of Israel are represented by their princes. Two each from the southern and northern tribes are mentioned. Out of Benjamin was Israel's first king, the first royal victor over the Gentiles; and in Benjamin, according to the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>) and according to the accounts of the boundaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a>.), lay the sanctuary of Israel. Thus, therefore, the tribe which, according both to order of birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-29.htm">Genesis 43:29</a>.) and also extent of jurisdiction and numbers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>), was "little," was honoured beyond the others.<p>(Note: Tertullian calls the Apostle Paul, with reference to his name and his Benjamitish origin, parvus Benjamin, just as Augustine calls the poetess of the Magnificat, nostra tympanistria.)<p>Judah, however, came to the throne in the person of David, and became for ever the royal tribe. Zebulun and Naphtali are the tribes highly praised in Deborah's song of victory (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>) on account of their patriotic bravery. &#1512;&#1491;&#1501;, giving no sense when taken from the well-known verb &#1512;&#1491;&#1501;, falls back upon &#1512;&#1491;&#1492;, and is consequently equivalent to &#1512;&#1491;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>), subduing or ruling them; according to the sense, equivalent to &#1512;&#1491;&#1492; &#1489;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-30.htm">1 Kings 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-10.htm">2 Chronicles 8:10</a>), like &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1501;, not "their leader up," but &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>, not  equals  &#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;), which would signify their subduer or their subduers. The verb &#1512;&#1491;&#1492;, elsewhere to subjugate, oppress, hold down by force, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-53.htm">Leviticus 25:53</a>, is here used of the peaceful occupation of the leader who maintains the order of a stately and gorgeous procession. For the reference to the enemies, "their subduer," is without any coherence. But to render the parallel word &#1512;&#1490;&#1502;&#1514;&#1501; "their (the enemies') stoning" (Hengstenberg, Vaihinger, and others, according to Bttcher's "Proben"), is, to say nothing more, devoid of taste; moreover &#1512;&#1490;&#1501; does not mean to throw stones with a sling, but to stone as a judicial procedure. If we assign to the verb &#1512;&#1490;&#1501; the primary signification congerere, accumulare, after Arab. rajama VIII, and rakama, then &#1512;&#1490;&#1502;&#1514;&#1501; signifies their closely compacted band, as Jewish expositors have explained it (&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493; &#1511;&#1489;&#1493;&#1510;&#1501;). Even if we connect &#1512;&#1490;&#1501; with &#1512;&#1511;&#1501;, variegare, or compare the proper name regem  equals  Arab. rajm, socius (Bttcher), we arrive at much the same meaning. Hupfeld's conjecture &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1501; is consequently unnecessary. </body></html>
