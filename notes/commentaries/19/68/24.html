The word "goings" here refers to the solemn triumphal processions which celebrated the victories achieved by God.<p>Even the goings of my God, my King - The psalmist here speaks of God as "his" God and "his" King. The idea seems to have suddenly crossed his mind that this great God, so glorious, is "his" God. He exults and rejoices that He whom he adores is such a God; that a God so great and glorious is "his." So the believer now, when he looks upon the works of God, when he contemplates their vastness, their beauty, and their grandeur, is permitted to feel that the God who made them is "his" God; to find consolation in the thought that his "Father made them all."<p>"He looks abroad into the varied field<p>Of Nature, and, though poor, perhaps, compared<p>With those whose mansions glitter in his sight,<p>Calls the delightful scenery all his own.<p>His are the mountains, and the valleys his,<p>And the resplendent rivers; - his to enjoy<p>With a propriety that none can feel<p>But who, with filial confidence inspired,<p>Can lift to heaven an unpresumptuous eye,<p>And smiling say, 'My Father made them all!'<p>Are they not his by a peculiar right,<p>And by an emphasis of interest his,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/68.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-27.

In the song the marchings of the Lord had been described; friends and foes had seen his goings forth with the ark and his people. We suppose that the procession was now climbing the hill, and entering the enclosure where the tabernacle of the ark was pitched; it was suitable at this moment to declare with song that 'the tribes had Seen the glorious progress of the Lord as he led forth his people. "Even the goings of my God, rail King, in the sanctuary." The splendid procession of the ark, which symbolised the throne of the great King, was before the eyes of men and angels as it ascended to the holy place; and the Psalmist points to it with exultation before he proceeds to describe it. All nature and providence are, as it were, a procession attending the great Lord, in his visitations of this lower globe. Winter and summer, sun and moon, storm and calm, and all the varied glories of nature swell the pomp of the King of kings, of whose dominion there is no end.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a><p>"The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after." This was the order of the march, and God is to be worshipped evermore with due decorum. First the singers, and lastly the musicians, for the song must lead the music, and not the music drown the singing. In the midst of the vocal and instrumental band, or all around them, were the maidens: "among them were the damsels playing with timbrels." Some have imagined that this order indicates the superiority of vocal to instrumental music; but we need not go so far for arguments, when the simplicity and spirituality of the gospel already teach us that truth. The procession depicted in this sublime song was one of joy, and every means was taken to express the delight of the nation in the Lord their God.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a><p>"Bless ye God in the congregations." Let the assembled company magnify the God whose ark they followed. United praise is like the mingled perfume which Aaron made, it Should all be presented unto God. He blesses us; let him be blessed. "Even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel." A parallel passage to that in Deborah's song: "They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord." The seat of the ark Would be the fountain of refreshing for all the tribes, and there they were to celebrate his praises. "Drink," says the old inscription, "drink, weary traveller; drink and pray." We may alter one word, and read it, drink and praise. If the Lord overflows with grace, we should overflow with gratitude. Ezekiel saw an ever-growing stream flow from under the altar, and issue out from under the threshold of the sanctuary, and wherever it flowed it gave life: let as many as have quaffed this life-giving stream glorify "the fountain of Israel."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a><p>"There is little Benjamin with their ruler." The tribe was small, having been greatly reduced in numbers, but it had the honour of including Zion within its territory. "And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.'" Little Benjamin had been Jacob's darling, and now the tribe is made to march first in the procession, and to dwell nearest to the holy place. "The princes of Judah and their council." Judah was a large and powerful tribe, not with one governor, like Benjamin, but with many princes "and their company," for so the margin has it. "From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel," and the tribe was a quarry of stones Wherewith to build up the nations' some such truth is hinted at in the Hebrew, "The princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali." Israel was there, as well as Judah; there was no schism among the people. The north sent a representative contingent as well as the south, and so the long procession set forth the hearty loyalty of all the tribes to their Lord and King. O happy day, when all believers shall be one around the ark of the Lord; striving for nothing but the glory of the God of grace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They have seen:</span> it is an indefinite expression; men saw and observed it, thy people to their comfort, and thine enemies with terror and astonishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy goings; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

These verses describe a solemn procession of thanksgiving to the Temple. But is it past, present, or future? Delitzsch is right when he says that it is “not the rejoicing over a victory lately won, not the rejoicing over the deliverance at the Red Sea in the days of old, but the rejoicing of Israel when it shall have seen the judicial and redemptive act of its God and King.” It is an ‘ideal’ description.

The conquest of Canaan is complete - God is gone up into his sanctuary. The nations are led captive or put to tribute Rebels are crushed; the last remnants of them sought out, brought back, and delivered into the hands of Israel. Now we have a description of God's "goings in the sanctuary" (ver. 24). Some critics suppose a particular occasion to be pointed at; but the expression "goings" rather indicates something habitual, or, at any rate, recurring. God is from time to time glorified in his sanctuary by ceremonies which the poet describes.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have seen thy goings, O God;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">men</span> have seen - friends and foes alike - even <span class="cmt_word">the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary</span>.

The war-chariots of the heavenly hosts are here collectively called &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; (with Dech, not Olewejored) is a dual from &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;; and this is either an abstract noun equivalent to &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (from which comes the apocopated &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;  equals  &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;), a myriad, consequently &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, two myriads, or a contracted plural out of &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>, therefore the dual of a plural (like &#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;): an indefinite plurality of myriads, and this again doubled (Hofmann). With this sense, in comparison with which the other is poor and meagre, also harmonies the expression &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497; &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1503;, thousands of repetition (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;), i.e., thousands and again thousands, numberless, incalculable thousands; cf. the other and synonymous expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>.<p>(Note: Tradition (Targum, Saadia, and Abulwald) takes &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1503; forthwith as a synonym of &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498;, an angel. So also the lxx (Jerome): &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;&#1503;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;), and Symmachus, &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;?).

They surround Him on both sides in many myriads, in countless thousands. &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1501; (with Beth raphatum), <p>(Note: This is one of the three passages (the others being <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a>; cf.

It now becomes clear why Sinai is mentioned, viz., because at the giving of the Law Jahve revealed Himself on Sinai surrounded by "ten thousands of saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>.). But in what sense is it mentioned? Zion, the poet means, presents to the spiritual eye now a spectacle such as Sinai presented in the earlier times, although even Sinai does not belong to the giants among the mountains: <p>(Note: Cf. the epigram in Sadi's Garden of Roses, "Of all mountains Sinai is the smallest, and yet the greatest in rank and worth in the estimation of God," etc. On the words &#1505;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; which follow we may to a certain extent compare the name of honour given to it in Arabic, t&#803;u&#770;r m&#8219;ana, "Sinai of Pensiveness" (Pertsch, Die persischen Handschriften der Gothaer Bibliothek, 1859, S. 24).)<p>God halts there with His angel host as a protection and pledge of victory to His people.

We must either render it: Sinai is in the sanctuary, i.e., as it were transferred into the sanctuary of Zion; or: a Sinai is it in holiness, i.e., it presents a spectacle such as Sinai presented when God by His appearing surrounded it with holiness.

Michaelis, Ewald), but the expression signifies inter homines, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; mentions the ascending of the triumphant One; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-12.htm">Judges 5:12</a>), the subjugation of the enemy; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, the receiving of the gifts betokening homage and allegiance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>, and frequently), which have been presented to Him since He has taken possession of Zion - there He sits enthroned henceforth over men, and receives gifts like to the tribute which the vanquished bring to the victor. These He has received among men, and even (&#1493;&#1488;&#1507;, atque etiam, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29-32</a>) among the rebellious ones. Or does a new independent clause perhaps begin with &#1493;&#1488;&#1507; &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;? This point will be decided by the interpretation of the words that follow. Side by side with an infinitive with &#1500; expressing a purpose, the one following noun (here a twofold name) has the assumption against it of being the subject. Is &#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; then consequently the object, or is it an apostrophe? If it be taken as the language of address, then the definition of the purpose, &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, ought, as not being suited to what immediately precedes, to refer back to &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;; but this word is too far off. Thus, therefore, the construction of &#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1500;&#1513;&#1499;&#1503;, as its object, is apparently intended (Ewald, Hupfeld): and even the rebellious are to dwell (Ges. 132, rem. 1) with Ja&#772;h Elohim descend and dwell; the Syriac version: and even the rebellious will ("not" is probably to be crossed out) dwell before God (&#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1488;); and Jerome: insuper et non credentes inhabitare Dominum Deum. Thus Theodoret also understands the versions of the lxx and of Aquila: "Thou hast not regarded their former disobedience, but notwithstanding their rebellion hast Thou continually been gracious to them &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; oikeetee'rion oikei'on ape'feenas." The expression, however, sounds too grand to have "the rebellious ones" as its subject, and more particularly in view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a>. Hence we take &#1493;&#1488;&#1507; &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;: and even among rebellious ones (hast Thou received gifts), or: and even rebellious ones (give Thee); and &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; as a clause denoting the purpose, followed by the subject (as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-20.htm">2 Samuel 19:20</a>): in order that Ja&#772;h Elohim may dwell, i.e., continue to dwell (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>).<p>The first half of the Psalm ends here. With the words Ja&#772;h Elohim the Psalm has reached a summit upon which it takes its rest. God has broken forth on behalf of His people against their enemies, and He now triumphs over and on behalf of men. The circumstance of Elohim arising is the raise of the final glory, and His becoming manifest as Ja&#772;h Elohim is its zenith. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>) gathers up the meaning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>, without following the lxx, in the following manner: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#837;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;. Might he perhaps have had the Targum, with which the Syriac version agrees, in his mind at the time: &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;? He interprets in the light and in the sense of the history that realizes it. For the ascension of Elohim in its historical fulfilment is none other than the ascension of Christ. This latter was, however, as the Psalm describes it, a triumphal procession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>); and what the Victor has gained over the powers of darkness and of death, He has gained not for His own aggrandisement, but for the interests of men. It is &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, gifts which He now distributes among men, and which benefit even the erring ones. So the apostle takes the words, inasmuch as he changes &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; into &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;. The gifts are the charismata which come down from the Exalted One upon His church.<p>(Note: In this respect <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a> is the most appropriate Psalm for the Dominica Pentecostes, just as it is also, in the Jewish ritual, the Psalm of the second Shabuoth day.)<p>It is a distribution of gifts, a dispensing of blessing, which stands related to His victory as its primary cause; for as Victor He is also the possessor of blessing, His gifts are as it were the spoils of the victory He has gained over sin, death, and Satan.<p>(Note: Just so Hlemann in the second division of his Bibelstudien (1861); whereas to Hormann (Schriftbeweis, ii. 482ff.) the New Testament application of the citation from the Psalm is differently brought about, because he refers neither &#x3b7;&#787;&#837;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; nor &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; to the descent of the Lord into Hades.)<p>The apostle is the more warranted in this interpretation, since Elohim in what follows is celebrated as the Lord who also brings out of death. This praise in the historical fulfilment applies to Him, who, as Theodoret observes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-21.htm">Psalm 68:21</a>, has opened up the prison-house of death, which for us had no exit, and burst the brazen doors, and broken asunder the iron bolts, <p>(Note: Just so that portion of the Gospel of Nicodemus that treats of Christ's descent into Hades; vis. Tischendorf, Evangelia Apocryph. (1853), p. 307.) <p>continued...</body></html>
