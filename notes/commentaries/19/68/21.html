Christ looks on all such as his enemies, and will treat them accordingly. The original words here used have great emphasis, and imply, God shall strike deep, or exhaust the blood of the head of his enemies, that is, utterly destroy them. As if he had said, “He will avenge himself on their devoted heads; nor shall their strength or craft be able to protect them from his indignation.” For <span class="ital">the head, </span>and the <span class="ital">hairy scalp, </span>or <span class="ital">crown, </span>denote the principal part, the strength, the pride, and the glory of the adversary, which was to be crushed, according to the original sentence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>. It is justly observed here by Dr. Horne, that this verse begins a prediction of that vengeance which the person who was “ascended on high would infallibly execute upon his impenitent enemies, and which was shadowed forth in the destruction of the enemies of Israel by David, after that the ark of God was placed upon the hill of Zion.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>68:15-21 The ascension of Christ must here be meant, and thereto it is applied, Eph 4:8. He received as the purchase of his death, the gifts needful for the conversion of sinners, and the salvation of believers. These he continually bestows, even on rebellious men, that the Lord God might dwell among them, as their Friend and Father. He gave gifts to men. Having received power to give eternal life, the Lord Jesus bestows it on as many as were given him, Joh 17:2. Christ came to a rebellious world, not to condemn it, but that through him it might be saved. The glory of Zion's King is, that he is a Saviour and Benefactor to all his willing people, and a consuming fire to all that persist in rebellion against him. So many, so weighty are the gifts of God's bounty, that he may be truly said to load us with them. He will not put us off with present things for a portion, but will be the God of our salvation. The Lord Jesus has authority and power to rescue his people from the dominion of death, by taking away the sting of it from them when they die, and giving them complete victory over it when they rise again. The crown of the head, the chief pride and glory of the enemy, shall be smitten; Christ shall crush the head of the serpent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/68.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But God shall wound the head of his enemies - More properly, "God shall crush the head," etc. The idea is that of complete destruction, - as, if the head is crushed, life becomes ex tinct.

The Hebrew word used here for "scalp" means the vertex, the top, the crown, as of the head, where the hair "divides itself;" and the idea is properly, "the dividing of the hair." Gesenius, Lexicon. The allusion is to the top of the head; that is, the blow would descend on the top of the head, producing death.<p>Of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses - Of the man who perseveres in a course of wickedness. If he repents, God will be merciful to him; if he persists in sin, he will be punished. The literal rendering would be, "the hairy scalp going on, or going, sc. "about", in his trespasses."

The mention of Zalmon leads him to mention other mountains. He uses the mountains of Bashan as an emblem of the hostile powers east of Jordan. These stand over against the people of God, as the mighty mountains of Bashan rising in steep, only slightly flattened peaks, to little hill-like Zion. In the land on this side Jordan the limestone and chalk formation with intermingled strata of sandstone predominates; the mountains of Bashan, however, are throughout volcanic, consisting of slag, lava, and more particularly basalt (basanites), which has apparently taken its name from Bashan (Basan).<p>(Note: This is all the more probable as Semitism has no proper word for basalt; in Syria it is called hag'ar aswad, "black stone.")<p>As a basalt range the mountains of Bashan are conspicuous among other creations of God, and are therefore called "the mountain of Elohim:" the basalt rises in the form of a cone with the top lopped off, or even towers aloft like so many columns precipitous and rugged to sharp points; hence the mountains of Bashan are called &#1492;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., a mountain range (for &#1492;&#1512;, as is well known, signifies both the single eminence and the range of summits) of many peaks  equals  a many-peaked mountain; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1503; is an adjective like &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;. With this boldly formed mass of rock so gloomily majestic, giving the impression of antiquity and of invincibleness, when compared with the ranges on the other side of unstable porous limestone and softer formations, more particularly with Zion, it is an emblem of the world and its powers standing over against the people of God as a threatening and seemingly invincible colossus. The poet asks these mountains of Bashan "why," etc.? &#1512;&#1510;&#1491; is explained from the Arabic rs&#803;d, which, in accordance with its root Arab. rs&#803;, signifies to cleave firmly to a place (firmiter inhaesit loco), properly used of a beast of prey couching down and lying in wait for prey, of a hunter on the catch, and of an enemy in ambush; hence then: to lie in wait for, lurk, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, craftily, insidiose (whence ra&#770;s&#803;id, a lier-in-wait, tarras&#803;s&#803;ud, an ambush), here: to regard enviously, invidiose. In Arabic, just as in this instance, it is construed as a direct transitive with an accusative of the object, whereas the original signification would lead one to look for a dative of the object (&#1512;&#1510;&#1491; &#1500;), which does also really occur in the common Arabic. Olewejored is placed by &#1490;&#1489;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, but what follows is not, after all, the answer: "the mountain - Elohim has chosen it as the seat of His throne," but &#1492;&#1492;&#1512; is the object of the interrogative clause: Quare indiviose observatis, montes cacuminosi, hunc montem (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;: that Zion yonder), quem, etc. (an attributive clause after the determinate substantive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-9.htm">Psalm 52:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-50.htm">Psalm 89:50</a>, and many other instances, contrary to the Arabic rule of style). Now for the first time, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>, follows that which is boastfully and defiantly contrasted with the proud mountains: "Jahve will also dwell for ever;" not only that Elohim has chosen Zion as the seat of His throne, it will also continue to be the seat of His throne, Jahve will continue to dwell [there] for ever. Grace is superior to nature, and the church superior to the world, powerful and majestic as this may seem to be. Zion maintains its honour over against the mountains of Bashan.</body></html>
