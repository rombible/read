If God bring his people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be as the wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold. Full salvation will render those white as snow, who were vile and loathsome through the guilt and defilement of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/68.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people ... - That is, in conducting them through the desert to the promised land. The statement in regard to the paternal character of God in the previous verses is here illustrated by his guiding his own people, when fleeing from a land of oppression, through the barren desert - and his interpositions there in their behalf. All that had been said of him in the previous verses is here confirmed by the provision which he made for their needs in their perilous journey through the wilderness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/68.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8.

What a sweetly suitable association, "thou" and "thy people;" - thou before, and thy people following! The Lord went before, and, therefore, whether the Red Sea or burning sand lay in the way, it mattered not; the pillar of cloud and fire always led them by a right way. "When thou didst march through the wilderness." He was the Commander-in-chief of Israel, from whom they received all orders, and the march was therefore his march. "His stately step the region drear beheld." We may speak, if we will, of the "wanderings of the children of Israel," but we must not think them purposeless strayings, they were in reality a well-arranged and well considered march.<p>"Selah." This seems an odd place for a musical pause or direction, but it is better to break a sentence than spoil praise. The sense is about to be superlatively grand, and, therefore, the selah intimates the fact to the players and singers, that they may with suitable solemnity perform their parts. It is never untimely to remind a congregation that the worship of God should be thoughtfully and heartily presented.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a><p>"The earth shook." Beneath the sublime tread the solid ground trembled. "The heavens also dropped at the presence of God," as if they bowed before their God, the clouds descended, and "a few dark shower-drops stole abroad." "Even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God." Moses tells us, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>, that "the whole mountain quaked greatly." That hill, so lone and high, bowed before the manifested God. "The God of Israel." The one only living and true God, whom Israel worshipped, and Who had chosen that nation to be his own above all the nations of the earth. This passage is so sublime, that it would be difficult to find its equal. May the reader's heart adore the God before whom the unconscious earth and sky act as if they recognised their Maker and were moved with a tremor of reverence.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a><p>"Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain." The march of God was not signalized solely by displays of terror, for goodness and bounty were also made conspicuous. Such rain as never fell before dropped on the desert sand, bread from heaven and winged fowls fell all around the host; good gifts were poured upon them; rivers leaped forth from rocks. The earth shook with fear, and in reply, the Lord, as from a cornucopia, shook out blessings upon it; so the original may be rendered. "Whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary." As at the end of each stage, when they halted, weary with the march, they found such showers of good things awaiting them that they were speedily refreshed. Their foot did not swell all those forty years. When they were exhausted, God was not, when they were weary, he was not. They were his chosen heritage, and, therefore, although for their good he allowed them to be weary, yet he watchfully tended them and tenderly considered their distresses. In like manner, to this day, the elect of God in this wilderness state are apt to become tired and faint, but their ever-loving Jehovah comes in with timely succours, cheers the faint, strengthens the weak, and refreshes the hungry; so that once again, when the silver trumpets sound, the church militant advances with bold and firm step towards "the rest which remaineth." By this faithfulness, the faith of God's people is confirmed, and their hearts stablished; if fatigue and want made them waver, the timely supply of grace stays them again upon the eternal foundation.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-10.htm">Psalm 68:10</a><p>"Thy congregation hath dwelt therein." In the wilderness itself, enclosed as in a wall of fire, thy chosen church has found a home; or, rather, girdled by: the shower of free gifts which fell all around the camp, thy flock has rested. The congregation of the faithful find the Lord to be their "dwelling-place in all generations." Where there were no dwellings of men, God was the dwelling of his people. "Thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor." Within the guarded circle there was plenty for all; all were poor in themselves, yet there were no beggars in all the camp, for celestial fare was to be had for the gathering, We, too, still dwell within the circling protection of the Most High, and find goodness made ready for us: although poor and needy by nature, we are enriched by grace; divine preparations in the decree, the covenant, the atonement, providence, and the Spirit's work, have made ready for us a fulness of the blessing of the Lord. Happy people, though in the wilderness, for all things are ours, in possessing the favour and presence of our God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In the cloudy pillar, as their Captain leading them out of Egypt. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/68.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people,....

Ewald and Hitzig take &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; hypothetically: If God arise, He enemies will be scattered. This rendering is possible in itself so far as the syntax is concerned, but here everything conspires against it; for the futures in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-4</a> form an unbroken chain; then a glance at the course of the Psalm from Psa 68:20 onwards shows that the circumstances of Israel, under which the poet writes, urged forth the wish: let God arise and humble His foes; and finally the primary passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>, makes it clear that the futures are the language of prayer transformed into the form of the wish. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a> the wish is addressed directly to God Himself, and therefore becomes petition. &#1492;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; is inflected (as vice vers&#1490; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>, from &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;) from &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1491;&#1507; (like &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>); it is a violation of all rule in favour of the conformity of sound (cf. &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-43.htm">Leviticus 14:43</a>, and supra on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) with &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;, the object of which is easily supplied (dispellas, sc. hostes tuos), and is purposely omitted in order to direct attention more stedfastly to the omnipotence which to every creature is so irresistible. Like smoke, wax (&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1490;, root &#1491;&#1490;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;, Sanscrit tak, to shoot past, to run, Zend tak&#769;, whence vitak&#769;ina, dissolving, Neo-Persic guda&#770;chten; causative: to cause to run in different directions  equals  to melt or smelt) is an emblem of human feebleness. As Bakiuds observes, Si creatura creaturam non fert, quomodo creatura creatoris indignantis faciem ferre possit? The wish expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-4.htm">Psalm 68:4</a> forms the obverse of the preceding. The expressions for joy are heaped up in order to describe the transcendency of the joy that will follow the release from the yoke of the enemy. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is expressively used in alternation with &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a> : by the wrathful action, so to speak, that proceeds from His countenance just as the heat radiating from the fire melts the wax the foes are dispersed, whereas the righteous rejoice before His gracious countenance.<p>As the result of the challenge that has been now expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-4</a>, Elohim, going before His people, begins His march; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a> an appeal is made to praise Him with song, His name with the music of stringed instrument, and to make a way along which He may ride &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;. In view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a> we cannot take &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as do the Targum and Talmud (B. Chagiga 12b), as a name of one of the seven heavens, a meaning to which, apart from other considerations, the verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, to be effaced, confused, dark, is not an appropriate stem-word; but it must be explained according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. There Jahve calls in the aid of His people, here He goes forth at the head of His people; He rides through the steppes in order to right against the enemies of His people. Not merely the historical reference assigned to the Psalm by Hitzig, but also the one adopted by ourselves, admits of allusion being made to the "steppes of Moab;" for the way to Mdeb, where the Syrian mercenaries of the Ammonites had encamped (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>), lay through these steppes, and also the way to Rabbath Ammon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7</a>.). &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; calls upon them to make a way for Him, the glorious, invincible King (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>); &#1505;&#1500;&#1500; signifies to cast up, heap up or pave, viz., a raised and suitable street or highway, Symmachus katastroo'sate. He who thus rides along makes the salvation of His people His aim: " is His name, therefore shout with joy before Him." The Beth in &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; (Symmachus, Quinta: &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b1;) is the Beth essentiae, which here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>, stands beside the subject: His name is (exists) in &#1497;&#1492;, i.e., His essential name is yh, His self-attestation, by which He makes Himself capable of being known and named, consists in His being the God of salvation, who, in the might of free grace, pervades all history. This Name is a fountain of exultant rejoicing to His people.<p>This Name is exemplificatively unfolded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>. The highly exalted One, who sits enthroned in the heaven of glory, rules in all history here below and takes an interest in the lowliest more especially, in all circumstances of their lives following after His own to succour them. He takes the place of a father to the orphan. He takes up the cause of the widow and contests it to a successful issue. Elohim is one who makes the solitary or isolated to dwell in the house; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; with He locale, which just as well answers the question where? as whither? &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, a house  equals  family bond, is the opposite of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;, solitarius, recluse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>. Dachselt correctly renders it, in domum, h.e. familiam numerosam durabilemque eos ut patres-familias plantabit. He is further One who brings forth (out of the dungeon and out of captivity) those who are chained into abundance of prosperity. &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, occurring only here, is a pluralet. from &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; morf .tela, synonym &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight, fortunate. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a> briefly and sharply expresses the reverse side of this His humanely condescending rule among mankind. &#1488;&#1498; is here (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>) restrictive or adversative (as is more frequently the case with &#1488;&#1499;&#1503;); and the preterite is the preterite of that which is an actual matter of experience. The &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., (not from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, the apostate ones, Aquila afista'menoi, but as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-7.htm">Psalm 66:7</a>, from &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;) the rebellious, Symmachus &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, who were not willing to submit to the rule of so gracious a God, had ever been excluded from these proofs of favour. These must inhabit &#1510;&#1495;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; (accusative of the object), a sun-scorched land; from &#1510;&#1495;&#1495;, to be dazzlingly bright, sunny, dried or parched up. They remain in the desert without coming into the land, which, fertilized by the waters of grace, is resplendent with a fresh verdure and with rich fruits. If the poet has before his mind in connection with this the bulk of the people delivered out of Egypt, &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-17.htm">Hebrews 3:17</a>), then the transition to what follows is much more easily effected. There is, however, no necessity for any such intermediation. The poet had the march through the desert to Canaan under the guidance of Jahve, the irresistible Conqueror, in his mind even from the beginning, and now he expressly calls to mind that marvellous divine leading in order that the present age may take heart thereat.</body></html>
