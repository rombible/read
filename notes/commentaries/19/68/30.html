So LXX. and Vulgate. The <span class= "ital">beast of the reed </span>is undoubtedly symbolical of Egypt, whether it be the <span class= "ital">crocodile </span>or the <span class= "ital">hippopotamus.</span><p><span class= "bld">Bulls . . . calves.</span>—These are possibly emblems respectively of the <span class= "ital">strong </span>and the <span class= "ital">weak</span>—the <span class= "ital">princes </span>and the <span class= "ital">common people. </span>(Comp., for a somewhat similar description of the Egyptians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/76-5.htm" title="The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.">Psalm 76:5-6</a>.) But a slight emendation suggested by Grätz gives <span class= "ital">the herd of bulls despisers of the people, </span>a reading quite in keeping with the ordinary use of this figure. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.">Jeremiah 1:11</a>.) The figure in connection with the <span class= "ital">bull-worship </span>of Egypt is especially significant.<p><span class= "bld">Till every one submit.</span>—This clause still waits for a satisfactory explanation. The Authorised Version is intelligible, but grammatically indefensible. The LXX. are undoubtedly right in taking the verb as a contracted infinitive preceded by a negative particle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.">Genesis 27:1</a>), and not as a participle. The meaning <span class= "ital">submit </span>or <span class= "ital">humble </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm" title="Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.">Proverbs 6:3</a>) is only with violence deduced from the original meaning of the verb, which (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm" title="After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.">Daniel 7:7</a>) means to <span class= "ital">stamp </span>like a furious animal. One cognate is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-18.htm" title="Seems it a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but you must foul the residue with your feet?">Ezekiel 34:18</a>) of a herd of bulls fouling the pasture with their feet, and another means to <span class= "ital">tread. </span>The form of the verb here used might mean <span class= "ital">to set oneself in quick motion, </span>which is the sense adopted by the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm" title="Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.">Proverbs 6:3</a>. Hence we get <span class= "ital">rebuke </span><span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "ital">from marching for pieces of silver, </span>the meaning being that a rebuke is administered not only to Egypt, but also to those Jews who took the pay of Egypt as mercenaries, and oppressed the rest of the community, a sense in keeping with the next clause.<p><span class= "bld">Scatter.</span>—The verb, as pointed, means <span class= "ital">hath scattered, </span>but the LXX. support the alteration to the imperative which the context demands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/68.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm" title="Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter you the people that delight in war.">Psalm 68:30</a></span>. <span class="ital">Rebuke, </span>&c. — Chastise those that will not bring presents unto thee till they see their error and submit themselves. It is a prophetical prayer against the enemies of the Israelitish Church. <span class="ital">The company of spearmen — </span>The reading in the margin, <span class="ital">The beasts of the reeds; </span>or, as <span class="greekheb">קנה חית</span>, <span class="ital">chajath kaneh, </span>is still more literally rendered, <span class="ital">the beast, </span>or <span class="ital">wild beast of the reed, </span>seems preferable here to this which our translators have placed in the text. For although the word <span class="greekheb">הית</span>, rendered congregation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-10.htm" title="Your congregation has dwelled therein: you, O God, have prepared of your goodness for the poor.">Psalm 68:10</a>, may signify <span class="ital">a company, </span>(see the note there,) it does not appear that there is any sufficient authority for translating <span class="greekheb">קנה</span>, <span class="ital">spearmen, </span>the word properly signifying a <span class="ital">reed. </span>The LXX. render the clause, <span class="greekheb">επιτιμησον τοις θηριοις του καλαμου</span>, <span class="ital">rebuke the beasts of the reed. </span>“By the <span class="ital">wild beast </span>(or beasts) <span class="ital">of the reeds,” </span>says Dr. Horne, after Poole, Chandler, Lowth, and several other learned men, “is to be understood the Egyptian power, described by its emblem, the crocodile, or river-horse, creatures living among the reeds of the Nile.” In consistency with this interpretation, by <span class="ital">the calves of the people, </span>or <span class="ital">of the nations, </span>as he translates it, he understands the objects of worship among the Egyptians, their Apis, Osiris, &c., around which <span class="ital">the congregation of the mighty </span>(Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">עדת אבירים</span>, <span class="ital">gnadath abbirim, </span>rendered in our text, <span class="ital">the multitude of the bulls</span>) assembled to worship. There is, however, one considerable objection to this interpretation. As David was not now attacked by the Egyptians, nor about to make war upon them, it does not seem likely that he should so particularly advert to them, or pray so pointedly against them, on this occasion. Some enemy, however, of great power, and fierce as a wild beast, was, no doubt, intended. Bishop Patrick, who refers us to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm" title="David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.">2 Samuel 8:3</a>, evidently thought that Hadadezer, king of Zobah, and the Syrians were meant. His paraphrase on the clause is, “Destroy that fierce prince, who, like a wild beast out of the forest, comes against us, with a great number of captains as furious as bulls, and of soldiers as insolent as young heifers.” <span class="ital">Till every one submit himself </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מתרפס</span>, <span class="ital">mithrappes, </span>literally, <span class="ital">casts himself down, </span>or <span class="ital">offers himself to be trod upon. </span>The same word bears the same sense <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm" title="Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.">Proverbs 6:3</a>. <span class="ital">With pieces of silver — </span>Bringing pieces of silver by way of tribute, or in token of subjection. This sense of the clause seems to connect best with the context, although, it must be acknowledged, the original text is very obscure, and is capable of several different interpretations, as learned men have shown: see Chandler, Lowth, Dodd, and Horne. Which interpretations it would require more room to state than can be spared in this work. <span class="ital">Scatter — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">בזר</span>, <span class="ital">bizzar, he hath scattered; </span>that is, according to the prophetic style, He will certainly scatter; <span class="ital">the people that delight in war — </span>That without any necessity or provocation, and merely out of love of mischief and spoil, make war upon others, and particularly upon us. The sense of the verse upon the whole is, Now that thou hast given thy people rest, and settled the ark in its place, O Lord, rebuke all our malicious and bloody enemies, and give us assured peace, that we may worship thee without disturbance. Thus “the Christian Church,” says Dr. Horne, “through faith in the power of her Lord, risen from the dead, and ascended into heaven, prays for the confusion of her implacable enemies, who delight in opposing the kingdom of Messiah.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>68:29-31 A powerful invitation is given to those that are without, to join the church. Some shall submit from fear; overcome by their consciences, and the checks of Providence, they are brought to make peace with the church. Others will submit willingly, ver. 29,31. There is that beauty and benefit in the service of God, and in the gospel of Christ which went forth from Jerusalem, which is enough to invite sinners out of all nations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/68.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rebuke the company of spearmen - Margin, "the beasts of the reeds." This is in the form of a prayer - "Rebuke;" but the idea is, that this "would" occur; and the meaning of the whole verse, though there is much difficulty in interpreting the particular expressions, is, that the most formidable enemies of the people of God, represented here by wild beasts, would be subdued, and would be made to show their submission by bringing presents - by "pieces of silver," or, with tribute. Thus the idea corresponds with that in the previous verse, that "kings would bring presents." The rendering in the margin here expresses the meaning of the Hebrew. It "might" perhaps be possible to make out from the Hebrew the sense in our common translation, but it is not the "obvious" meaning, and would not accord so well with the scope of the passage. On the word rendered "company," which primarily means an animal, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-10.htm">Psalm 68:10</a>.<p>It is applied to an army as being formidable, or terrible, "like" a wild beast. The word rendered "spearmen" - &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;  qa&#770;neh - means "a reed" or "cane;" "calamus." Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>; notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>. This phrase, "the beast of the reeds," would properly denote a wild beast, as living among the reeds or canes that sprang up on the banks of a river, and having his home there. It would thus, perhaps, most naturally suggest the crocodile, but it might also be applicable to a lion or other wild beast that had its dwelling in the jungles or bushes on the banks of a river. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>. The comparison here would, therefore, denote any powerful and fierce monarch or people that might be compared with such a fierce beast. There is no particular allusion to Egypt, as being the abode of the crocodile, but the reference is more general, and the language would imply that fierce and savage people - kings who might be compared with wild beasts that had their homes in the deep and inaccessible thickets - would come bending with the tribute money, with pieces of silver, in token of their subjection to God.<p>The multitude of the bulls - Fierce and warlike kings, who might be compared with bulls. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>.<p>With the calves of the people - That is, the nations that might be compared with the calves of such wild herds - fierce, savage, powerful. Their leaders might be compared with the bulls; the people - the multitudes - were like the wild and lawless herd of young ones that accompanied them. The general idea is, that the most wild and savage nations would come and acknowledge their subjection to God, and would express that subjection by an appropriate offering.<p>Till every one submit himself with pieces of silver - The word here rendered "submit" means properly to tread with the feet, to trample upon; and then, in the form used here, to let oneself be trampled under feet, to prostrate oneself; to humble oneself. Here it means that they would come and submissively offer silver as a tribute. That is, they would acknowledge the authority of God, and become subject to him.<p>Scatter thou the people that delight in war - Margin, "He scattereth." The margin expresses the sense most accurately. The reference is to God. The psalmist sees the work already accomplished. In anticipation of the victory of God over his foes, he sees them already discomfited and put to flight. The mighty hosts which had been arrayed against the people of God are dissipated and driven asunder; or, in other words, a complete victory is obtained. The people that "delighted in war" were those that had a pleasure in arraying themselves against the people of God - the enemies that had sought their overthrow. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/68.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.

Or the <span class="ital">reed</span> may be taken properly; and by <span class="ital">the beast of the reed</span> he may understand the king of Egypt, who then was a very potent and a most idolatrous king, and a great and old enemy to the true religion, and to the people of Israel, whom therefore he desires God to rebuke and humble, that he may acknowledge the true God, which is foretold that he shall do, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm" title="Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.">Psalm 68:31</a></span>.

For <span class="ital">submit himself</span>, it is in the Hebrew <span class="ital">cast himself down</span>, or <span class="ital">offer himself to be trod upon</span>. But because this supplement may seem too large, and not necessary, the words are and may be rendered otherwise, <span class="ital">that tread upon</span>, or <span class="ital">walk proudly in</span> or <span class="ital">with, fragments</span> or <span class="ital">pieces of silver</span>, wherewith eminent captains used to adorn themselves and their very horses.

So this may contain an answer, or his assurance of an answer, to his prayer: I prayed, <span class="ital">Rebuke the company</span>, &c., and God hath heard my prayer, and I doubt not will rebuke or scatter them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That delight in war; </span> that without any necessity or provocation, and merely out of a love to mischief and spoil, make war upon others, and upon us particularly. Now that thou hast given thy people rest, and settled the ark in its place, O Lord, rebuke all our malicious and bloody enemies, and give us assured peace, that we may worship the Lord without disturbance. And withal David may seem to utter this for his own vindication. It is true, O Lord, I have been a man of war, and therefore have lost the honour of building the temple, and am now forced to lodge the ark in a mean tabernacle, which I have erected for it; but this thou knowest, that I have not undertaken any of my wars out of wantonness, or ambition, or love to war and mischief, but only by constraint and necessity, for the just defence of myself and of thy people; and therefore do not lay my wars to my charge. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/68.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Rebuke the company of spearmen,.... Or, "of the reed" (d); that is, men that use and fight with spears, like to reeds, as Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it. Aben Ezra says, that spears are so called in the Kedarene or Arabian language; and the Arabians use a sort of reed for a spear, as Mr. Castel out of Avicenna observes (e), and Pliny (f) says they are used spears: or rather the words should be rendered, "rebuke", restrain, destroy "the wild beast", or "beasts of the reed" (g); as the Syriac, Septuagint, and Vulgate Latin versions, and others, render it: the allusion is to such kind of creatures as lions in the thickets of Jordan; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; and the behemoth, that lies under the covert of reeds, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-21.htm">Job 40:21</a>; or as the crocodile in the river Nile, and other rivers of Egypt, which abounded with flags and reeds, in which such creatures lay; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>; perhaps the hippopotamus, or river horse, is referred to; so may design an insidious, cruel, and tyrannical prince; such an one as Pharaoh king of Egypt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; a type of antichrist, and who seems to be here meant; for as Rome, for its wickedness, cruelty, and idolatry, is spiritually called Egypt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; so the Romish antichrist is the beast ascending out of the bottomless pit; and is an insidious creature, lies in wait to deceive, puts on the mask and visor of Christianity; has two horns, like a lamb in his ecclesiastic capacity; lies covered with the reeds of the traditions, inventions, and the doctrines of men; and teaches men to trust in the staff of a broken reed, in their own merits, and the merits of others. Jarchi interprets it of Esau, who is like to a wild boar that dwells among the reeds; and the Talmud (h) interprets it of a beast that dwells among reeds, and the gloss explains it of the nation of Amalek; the Turks, according to some, are meant; <p>the multitude of bulls; the secular powers of the beast of Rome; the antichristian states, their kings and princes, comparable to these creatures for their great strength, power, and authority, and for their fierceness and furiousness in persecuting the people of God: these are horned creatures, the ten horns of the beast, in his civil and secular capacity, with which he pushes at the saints, casts them down, and tramples upon them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>; compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-18.htm">Revelation 19:18</a>; <p>with the calves of the people; or the people, comparable to calves for their weakness, folly, and stupidity; these are the common people under the government and influence of the kings and princes of the earth; the people, multitudes, nations, and tongues, over whom the antichristian harlot sits, rules, and reigns: this phrase shows that the whole is to be taken, not in a literal, but figurative, sense; <p>till everyone submit himself with pieces of silver; that is, rebuke them by thy word, or by thy providences, until they become sensible of their sins, repent of them, and submit themselves to Christ; and bring with them their wealth and substance, and lay it at his feet for the use of his interest, as a testification of their subjection to him: but as this is not to be expected from the persons before described, at least not from everyone of them, the words require another sense, and are to be considered as a continued description of the persons to be rebuked, and may be rendered, even everyone "that treads with pieces of silver" (k); that walks proudly and haughtily, being decorated with gold and silver on their garments; so the Romish antichrist is said to be decked, his popes, cardinals, and bishops, with gold and precious stones, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>; or "everyone that humbles himself for pieces of silver" (l), as the word is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm">Proverbs 6:3</a>; that lies down to be trampled upon for the sake of temporal advantage; and so it describes the parasites and flatterers of the man of sin, who crouch unto him, take his mark in their hands or foreheads, that they may be allowed to buy and sell; all these, it is desired, God would rebuke, not in love, but with flames of fire, as he will sooner or later; for when the kings of the earth are become Christians, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a>, God will put it into their hearts to hate the whore, and burn her flesh with fire; <p>scatter thou the people that delight in war; as antichrist, and the antichristian states, do: they take delight in making war with the saints, and in slaying of them, to whom power has been given so to do; with whose blood they have been made drunk, and have took as much pleasure in the shedding of it as a drunken man does in indulging himself to excess in liquor; but these in God's own time shall be scattered, when Christ the Lamb shall fight against them with the sword of his mouth, and shall utterly destroy them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>. <p>(d)  "congregationem calami", Pagninus.

Their proud spirits are subdued by the irresistible divine ‘rebuke’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm" title="At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.">Psalm 76:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm" title="The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.">Isaiah 17:13</a>); they prostrate themselves in the dust before the Lord of the world, and offer tribute of their wealth. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-9.htm" title="Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of the LORD your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you.">Isaiah 60:9</a>. This gives a fair sense, but the construction is difficult. The difficulty is avoided by the rendering of R.V., which makes the participle refer to God: Trampling under foot the pieces of silver, i.e. spurning the tribute which they bring Thee. The true meaning is however quite uncertain, and the text is very possibly corrupt. The Ancient Versions vary greatly, some of them pointing to varieties of reading. Of the host of modern emendations, one may be mentioned which only requires alteration of the vowel points: ‘Trampling under foot <span class="ital">them that delight in silver</span>’; but it can hardly be pronounced satisfactory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">scatter thou</span> &c.] The Massoretic Text reads: He bath scattered the peoples: a ‘prophetic perfect,’ realising the triumph of God over all opposition as already complete. But it suits the context better to read the imperative with LXX and Jer., scatter thou. The difference is one of vocalisation only.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke the company of spear men;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the wild beast of the reeds</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the crocodile or the hippopotamus, either of which may well symbolize the empire of Egypt, the mightiest of the heathen powers in David's time. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude of the bulls</span> represents other heathen powers, Assyria perhaps especially, which had the human-headed and winged bull for its principal emblem. <span class="cmt_word">With the calves of the people;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of peoples</span> - an obscure phrase, perhaps meaning inferior powers.

Comforted by the majestic picture of the future that he has beheld, the poet returns to the present, in which Israel is still oppressed, but yet not forsaken by God. The translation follows the accentuation, regular and in accordance with the sense, which has been restored by Baer after Heidenheim, viz., &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; has Zarka, and &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1505; &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; Olewejored preceded by the sub-distinctive Rebia parvum; it is therefore: Benedictus Dominator: quotidie bajulat nobis, - with which the Targum, Rashi, and Kimchi agree.<p>(Note: According to the customary accentuation the second &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; has Mercha or Olewejored, and &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1505;&#1470;&#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, Mugrash. But this Mugrash has the position of the accents of the Silluk-member against it; for although it does exceptionally occur that two conjunctives follow Mugrash (Accentsystem, xvii. 5), yet these cannot in any case be Mahpach sarkatum and Illui.)<p>&#1506;&#1502;&#1505;, like &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; and &#1505;&#1489;&#1500;, unites the significations to lay a burden upon one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-3.htm">Zechariah 12:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>), and to carry a burden; with &#1506;&#1500; it signifies to lay a burden upon any one, here with &#1500; to take up a burden for any one and to bear it for him. It is the burden or pressure of the hostile world that is meant, which the Lord day by day helps His church to bear, inasmuch as He is mighty by His strength in her who of herself is so feeble. The divine name &#1488;&#1500;, as being the subject of the sentence, is &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;: God is our salvation. The music here again strikes in forte, and the same thought that is emphasized by the music in its turn, is also repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-21.htm">Psalm 68:21</a> with heightened expression: God is to us a God &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, who grants us help in rich abundance. The pluralet. denotes not so much the many single proofs of help, as the riches of rescuing power and grace. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-21.htm">Psalm 68:21</a> &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; corresponds to the &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; for it is not to be construed &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;: Jahve's, the Lord, are the outgoings to death (Bttcher), i.e., He can command that one shall not fall a prey to death. &#1514;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, the parallel word to &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, signifies, and it is the most natural meaning, the escapings; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, evadere, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:18</a>. In Jahve's power are means of deliverance for death, i.e., even for those who are already abandoned to death. With &#1488;&#1498; a joyously assuring inference is drawn from that which God is to Israel. The parallelism of the correctly divided verse shows that &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-6.htm">Psalm 110:6</a>, signifies caput in the literal sense, and not in the sense of princeps. The hair-covered scalp is mentioned as a token of arrogant strength, and unhumbled and impenitent pride, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-42.htm">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>, and as the Attic koma'n directly signifies to strut along, give one's self airs. The genitival construction is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a>. The form of expression refers back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, and so to speak inflects this primary passage very similarly to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>. If &#1511;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491; &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512; be an object, then &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; ought also to be a second object (that of the member of the body); the order of the words does not in itself forbid this (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-11.htm">Deuteronomy 33:11</a>), but would require a different arrangement in order to avoid ambiguities.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-23.htm">Psalm 68:23</a> the poet hears a divine utterance, or records one that he has heard: "From Bashan will I bring back, I will bring back from the eddies of the sea (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;, to whiz, rattle; to whirl, eddy), i.e., the depths or abysses of the sea." Whom? When after the destruction of Jerusalem a ship set sail for Rome with a freight of distinguished and well-formed captives before whom was the disgrace of prostitution, they all threw themselves into the sea, comforting themselves with this passage of Scripture (Gittin 57b, cf. Echa Rabbathi 66a). They therefore took <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-23.htm">Psalm 68:23</a> to be a promise which has Israel as its object; <p>(Note: So also the Targum, which understands the promise to refer to the restoration of the righteous who have been eaten by wild beasts and drowned in the sea (Midrash: &#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;); cf. also the things related from the time of the Khaliphs in Jost's Geschichte des Judenthums, ii. 399, and Grtz' Gesch. der Juden, v. 347.)<p>but the clause expressing a purpose, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a>, and the paraphrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2</a>., show that the foes of Israel are conceived of as its object. Even if these have hidden themselves in the most out-of-the-way places, God will fetch them back and make His own people the executioners of His justice upon them. The expectation is that the flight of the defeated foes will take a southernly direction, and that they will hide themselves in the primeval forests of Bashan, and still farther southward in the depths of the sea, i.e., of the Dead Sea (&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>). Opposite to the hiding in the forests of the mountainous Bashan stands the hiding in the abyss of the sea, as the extreme of remoteness, that which is in itself impossible being assumed as possible. The first member of the clause expressing the purpose, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a>, becomes more easy and pleasing if we read &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1509; (lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate, ut intingatur), according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-11.htm">Psalm 58:11</a>. So far as the letters are concerned, the conjecture &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1509; (from which &#1514;&#1502;&#1495;&#1509;, according to Chajug', is transposed), after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>, is still more natural (Hitzig): that thy foot may redden itself in blood. This is certainly somewhat tame, and moreover &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; would be better suited to this rendering than &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1501;. As the text now stands, &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1509;<p>(Note: The Gaja of the first closed syllable warns one to make a proper pause upon it, in order that the guttural of the second, so apt to be slurred over, may be distinctly pronounced; cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>; &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>. So also with the sibilants at the beginning of the second syllable, e.g., &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>, in accordance with which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/53-2.htm">Genesis 53:2</a>, we must write &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;.)<p>is equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1501; (them, viz., the enemies), and &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1501; is an adverbial clause (setting or plunging thy foot in blood). It is, however, also possible that &#1502;&#1495;&#1509; is used like Arab. machad&#803;a (vehementer commovere): ut concutias s. agites pedem tuam in sanguine. Can it now be that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a> from among the number of the enemies of the one who goes about glorying in his sins, the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>, and other passages), is brought prominently forward by &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;? Hardly so; the absence of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1511; (lambat) cannot be tolerated, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a>. It is more natural, with Simonis, to refer &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; back to &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (a word which is usually fem., but sometimes perhaps is masc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a>); and, since side by side with &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; only &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; occurs anywhere else (Ew. 263, b), to take it in the signification pars ejus (&#1502;&#1503; from &#1502;&#1504;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1490;&#1492;, after the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;, &#1495;&#1503;, &#1511;&#1509;, of the same meaning as &#1502;&#1490;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1504;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>), in favour of which Hupfeld also decides.<p>What is now described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25-28</a>, is not the rejoicing over a victory gained in the immediate past, nor the rejoicing over the earlier deliverance at the Red Sea, but Israel's joyful celebration when it shall have experienced the avenging and redemptive work of its God and King. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>, &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; appears to be God's march against the enemy; but what follows shows that the pompa magnifica of God is intended, after He has overcome the enemy. Israel's festival of victory is looked upon as a triumphal procession of God Himself, the King, who governs in holiness, and has now subjugated and humbled the unholy world; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>. The rendering "in the sanctuary' is very natural in this passage, but <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>, are against it. The subject of &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is all the world, more especially those of the heathen who have escaped the slaughter. The perfect signifies: they have seen, just as &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, they have occupied the front position. Singers head the procession, after them (&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;,<p>(Note: This &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, according to B.

It is a retrospective reference to the song at the Sea, now again come into life, which Miriam and the women of Israel sang amidst the music of timbrels. The deliverance which is now being celebrated is the counterpart of the deliverance out of Egypt. Songs resound as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a>, "in gatherings of the congregation (and, so to speak, in full choirs) praise ye Elohim." &#1502;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; (&#1502;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-12.htm">Psalm 26:12</a>) is the plural to &#1511;&#1492;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>), which forms none of its own (cf. post-biblical &#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;). <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a> is abridged from &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493; &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; &#1502;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;, praise ye the Lord, ye who have Israel for your fountainhead. &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, in accordance with the sense, has Mugrash.

In the festive assembly all the tribes of Israel are represented by their princes. Two each from the southern and northern tribes are mentioned. Out of Benjamin was Israel's first king, the first royal victor over the Gentiles; and in Benjamin, according to the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>) and according to the accounts of the boundaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a>.), lay the sanctuary of Israel. Thus, therefore, the tribe which, according both to order of birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-29.htm">Genesis 43:29</a>.) and also extent of jurisdiction and numbers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>), was "little," was honoured beyond the others.<p>(Note: Tertullian calls the Apostle Paul, with reference to his name and his Benjamitish origin, parvus Benjamin, just as Augustine calls the poetess of the Magnificat, nostra tympanistria.)<p>Judah, however, came to the throne in the person of David, and became for ever the royal tribe.

The verb &#1512;&#1491;&#1492;, elsewhere to subjugate, oppress, hold down by force, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-53.htm">Leviticus 25:53</a>, is here used of the peaceful occupation of the leader who maintains the order of a stately and gorgeous procession.

But to render the parallel word &#1512;&#1490;&#1502;&#1514;&#1501; "their (the enemies') stoning" (Hengstenberg, Vaihinger, and others, according to Bttcher's "Proben"), is, to say nothing more, devoid of taste; moreover &#1512;&#1490;&#1501; does not mean to throw stones with a sling, but to stone as a judicial procedure. If we assign to the verb &#1512;&#1490;&#1501; the primary signification congerere, accumulare, after Arab. rajama VIII, and rakama, then &#1512;&#1490;&#1502;&#1514;&#1501; signifies their closely compacted band, as Jewish expositors have explained it (&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493; &#1511;&#1489;&#1493;&#1510;&#1501;). Even if we connect &#1512;&#1490;&#1501; with &#1512;&#1511;&#1501;, variegare, or compare the proper name regem  equals  Arab. rajm, socius (Bttcher), we arrive at much the same meaning. Hupfeld's conjecture &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1501; is consequently unnecessary. </body></html>
