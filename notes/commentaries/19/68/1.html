And in these same words the singers began, when, at the command of David, the Levites first took up the ark on their shoulders to carry it from the house of Obed-edom to Zion. There is, indeed, this little difference between the passage in Numbers and this of the Psalm, that the first word of the former in the Hebrew is in the imperative mood, <span class="greekheb">קומה</span>, <span class="ital">kumah, Let God arise, </span>whereas here the word is in the future tense, and is literally rendered, <span class="ital">God shall, </span>or <span class="ital">will, arise. </span>And, in like manner, all the clauses of this and the next two verses are expressed in the same tense, as if they were a prediction of what was to come; <span class="ital">his enemies shall be scattered — those that hate him shall flee, </span>&c. — God’s enemies, it must be observed, are also the enemies of his people, and they are therefore said to hate him, because they hate them, and because they hate his laws and government, and his holy image and nature; the carnal mind which is in them, being enmity against him, and not subject to his law, neither, indeed, can it be subject thereto. <span class="ital">As smoke is driven away — </span>Which, though it rises from the earth in black and tremendous clouds, is soon scattered and dispersed by the wind; <span class="ital">so drive them away — </span>Or, <span class="ital">so they shall be driven away, </span>shall be dispersed by a force which, notwithstanding their threatening aspect, they are utterly unable to resist. <span class="ital">And as wax melteth before the fire — </span>Which, though to appearance it be of a firm and solid consistence, yet, when brought to the fire, is soon dissolved, and makes no resistance; <span class="ital">so let the wicked perish,</span> &c. — And so they shall perish when the Lord is <span class="ital">revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire.

There is an obvious reterence here to the words used by Moses on the removal of the ark in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>. The same language was also employed by Solomon when the ark was removed to the temple, and deposited in the most holy place <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-41.htm">2 Chronicles 6:41</a> :" Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength." It would seem probable, therefore, that this psalm was composed on some such occasion.<p>Let his enemies be scattered - So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a> : "Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee." The ark was the symbol of the divine presence, and the idea is, that whereever that was, the enemies of God would be subdued, or that it was only by the power of Him who was supposed to reside there that his enemies could be overcome.<p>Let them also that hate him flee before him - Almost the exact language used by Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>. It is possible that this may have been used on some occasion when the Hebrews were going out to war; but the more probable supposition is that it is general language designed to illustrate the power of God, or to state that his rising up, at any time, would be followed by the discomfiture of his enemies. The placing of the ark where it was designed to remain permanently would be a proper occasion for suggesting this general truth, that all the enemies of God must be scattered when he rose up in his majesty and power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/68.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 68<p>Ps 68:1-35. This is a Psalm-song (see on [604]Ps 30:1, title), perhaps suggested by David's victories, which secured his throne and gave rest to the nation. In general terms, the judgment of God on the wicked, and the equity and goodness of His government to the pious, are celebrated. The sentiment is illustrated by examples of God's dealings, cited from the Jewish history and related in highly poetical terms. Hence the writer intimates an expectation of equal and even greater triumphs and summons all nations to unite in praises of the God of Israel. The Psalm is evidently typical of the relation which God, in the person of His Son, sustains to the Church (compare Ps 68:18).<p>1-3. Compare Nu 10:35; Ps 1:4; 22:14, on the figures here used.<p>before him&#8212;as in Ps 68:2, from His presence, as dreaded; but in Ps 68:3, in His presence, as under His protection (Ps 61:7).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/68.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.<p>2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-1.htm">Psalm 68:1</a><p>"Let God arise." In some such words Moses spake when the cloud moved onward, and the ark was carried forward. The ark would have been a poor leader if the Lord had not been present with the symbol. Before we move; we should always desire to see the Lord lead the way. The words suppose the Lord to have been passive for awhile, suffering his enemies to rage, but restraining his power. Israel beseeches him to arise, as elsewhere to "awake, gird on his sword," and other similar expressions. We, also, may thus importunately cry unto the Lord, that he would be pleased to make bare his arm, and plead his own cause. "Let his enemies be scattered." Our glorious Captain of the vanguard clears the way readily, however many may seek to obstruct it; he has but to arise, and they flee, he has easily over-thrown his foes in days of yore, and will do so all through the ages to come. Sin, death, and hell know the terror of his arm; their ranks are broken at his approach. Our enemies are his enemies, and in this is our confidence of victory. "Let them also that hate him flee before him." To hate the infinitely good God is infamous, and the worst punishment is not too severe. Hatred of God is impotent. His proudest foes can do him no injury. Alarmed beyond measure, they shall flee before it comes to blows. Long before the army of Israel can come into the fray, the haters of God shall flee before HIM who is the champion of his chosen. He comes, he sees, he conquers. How fitting a prayer is this for the commencement of a revival! How it suggests the true mode of conducting one: - the Lord leads the way, his people follow, the enemies flee.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a><p>"As smoke is driven away." Easily the wind chases the smoke, completely it removes it, no trace is left; so, Lord, do thou to the foes of thy people. They fume in pride, they darken the sky with their malice, they mount higher and higher in arrogance, they defile wherever they prevail: Lord, let thy breath, thy Spirit, thy Providence, make them to vanish for ever from the march of thy people. Philosophic scepticism is as flimsy and as foul as smoke; may the Lord deliver his Church from the reek of it. "As wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God." Wax is hard by itself, but put it to the fire, how soft it is. Wicked men are haughty till they come into contact with the Lord, and then they faint for fear; their hearts melt like wax when they feel the power of his anger. Wax, also, burns and passes away; the taper is utterly consumed by the flame: so shall all the boastful power of the opposers of the gospel be as a thing of nought. Rome, like the candles on her altars, shall dissolve, and with equal certainty shall infidelity disappear. Israel saw, in the ark, God on the mercy-seat - power in connection with propitiation - and they rejoiced in the omnipotence of such a manifestation; this is even more clearly the confidence of the New Testament church, for we see Jesus, the appointed atonement, clothed with glory and majesty, and before his advance all opposition melts like snow in the sun, the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands. When he comes by his Holy Spirit, conquest is the result; but when he arises in person, his foes shall utterly perish. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The occasion of this Psalm seems to have been David’s translation of the ark to Zion, which was managed with great solemnity and devotion, and celebrated with some Psalms, and this among the rest. For the first words are the very same which Moses appointed for such occasions, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.">Numbers 10:35</a></span>, and the following verses pursue the same matter with the first. Thence he falls into a description of some of the excellent properties and glorious works of the God to whom this ark belonged. But because David very well knew that both himself and the ark were types of Christ, and that the church and people of Israel were a type of the catholic church, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, and that the legal administrations and actions were types of those of the gospel, he therefore, by the Spirit of prophecy, looked through and beyond the present actions and types, unto the great mysteries of Christ’s resurrection and ascension into heaven, and of the special privileges of the Christian church, and of the conversion of the Gentiles unto God, and therefore intermixeth some passages which directly and immediately belong to these things, although the words be so ordered that they carry a manifest allusion to the present actions, and may in some sort be applied to them, though in a more obscure and improper and secondary sense. Nor is it at all strange that in the same Psalm there is such a mixture of things, whereof some belong only to the actions or events of that time, and some only to Christ and the gospel times, if it be considered that the psalmist in himself doth frequently express divers, and those contrary, passions and dispositions, as hope and fear, &c., in the same Psalm, and sometimes in the same verse, and especially that the sacred penmen in the composition of these writings were men wholly inspired, and governed, and moved by the Holy Ghost, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2 Peter 1:21</a></span>, by whom they were variously transported, as he saw fit, and sometimes carried away to speak of the highest mysteries of the gospel, even such things as they themselves did not fully understand, as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1 Peter 1:10</a>,11</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">At the removing of the ark, David exhorteth to praise the Lord, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/68-1.htm" title="Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him....">Psalm 68:1-5</a></span>, for his wonderful power and love in delivering his people out of Egypt, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-6.htm" title="God sets the solitary in families: he brings out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.">Psalm 68:6</a></span>; leading them through the wilderness, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/68-7.htm" title="O God, when you went forth before your people, when you did march through the wilderness; Selah:...">Psalm 68:7-11</a></span>; subduing their enemies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-12.htm" title="Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.">Psalm 68:12</a></span>; and choosing Zion for his habitation, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/68-13.htm" title="Though you have lien among the pots, yet shall you be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold....">Psalm 68:13-18</a></span>.

All God’s enemies are here said to hate God, not directly and formally, for there are few such persons, but because they hate his laws and government, and his people and image, and because they fight against him and his, which is justly taken for an evidence of hatred. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/68.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let God arise,.... Which, as Kimchi observes, is either by way of prayer, or by way of prophecy; and in either way the sense is the same: for, if it is considered as a prayer, it is a prayer of faith that so it would be; or, if as a prophecy, it is certain that so it should be. And this is to be understood of the same divine Person, whose chariots the angels are; who is said to be the "Adonai", or "Lord" in the midst of them; and of whom it is prophesied that he should ascend to heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; even the Messiah, who is God over all. And this "arising", attributed to him, may be interpreted either of his incarnation, his exhibition and manifestation in the flesh; which is sometimes called in Scripture a raising of him up, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-26.htm">Acts 3:26</a>; or of his resurrection from the dead, as it is interpreted by many of the ancients; which, as it was a certain thing, and previous to his ascension hereafter spoken of, so it was a proof of his deity; for though it was only the man that rose, who died and was buried, yet as in union with the divine Person of the Son of God, and who rose by virtue of that union; and thereby he was declared to be the Son of God with power. Or else rather this is to be understood of his arising and exerting his power as a man of war, as a mighty and victorious hero, on the behalf of his people, and against his enemies; as he did when he arose and met Satan, the prince of the world, and engaged with all the powers of darkness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>; and this sense is confirmed by what follows: <p>let his enemies be scattered; let them also that hate him flee before him: the sense of these two clauses is the same; his enemies, and those that hate him, are the same persons; and to be scattered and flee express the same things; for enemies, being discomfited, flee and scatter. Some interpret this of the watch set to guard our Lord's sepulchre; who, upon his rising from the dead, were filled with great fear and dread, and scattered, and fled to the priests, to acquaint them with what was done: others, of the Jewish nation in general, who were enemies to Christ; and hated him, and would not have him to reign over them; against whom he rose up and exerted his great strength; came in his kingdom and power against them; poured out his wrath upon them to the uttermost; which issued in the utter destruction of them, as a body politic; and in the entire dispersion of them in all countries, which remains until quite recently. Or rather the whole is to be applied to Satan, and to his principalities and powers; the professed enemies of Christ, personal and mystical; who, when he arose and exerted his mighty power in his conflict with them, in the garden and on the cross, were spoiled and dissipated, and obliged to fly before him: and who at the same time overcame the world, made an end of sin, abolished death, as well as destroyed him which had the power of it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/68.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><<To the chief Musician, A Psalm <i>or</i> Song of David.>> Let God <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.</span><p>(a) The prophet shows that even though God permits the wicked tyrants to oppress his Church for a time, yet eventually he will take revenge on them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/68.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>.
