Its literal reading is, <span class= "ital">God’s chariots, two myriads of thousands, and again myriads of thousands </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">of repetition</span>)<span class= "ital">, the Lord among them, Sinai in holiness; </span>which, by strict rule, must mean: “God’s chariots are innumerable, and the Lord rides in them to Sinai, into the holy place.” But this rendering is quite against the whole tenor of the passage, which is descriptive of a march <span class= "ital">from</span>, not <span class= "ital">to, </span>Sinai. Hence some suggest the rendering, “The Lord is among them—a Sinai in holiness,” meaning that Zion has become <span class= "ital">Sinai, </span>a common enough figure in poetry (comp. <span class= "ital">In medio Tibure Sardinia est</span>—Mart. 4:60), but only discovered here by a roundabout process. There can hardly be a question as to the propriety of the emendation suggested by Dr. Perowne, <span class= "ital">The Lord is with them; He has come from Sinai into the holy place. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm" title="My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain on the tender herb, and as the showers on the grass:">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>, which was undoubtedly in the poet’s mind.)<p><span class= "bld">Of</span> <span class= "bld">angels.</span>—This rendering arose from a confusion of the word which means <span class= "ital">repetition </span>with a word which means <span class= "ital">shining. </span>LXX., “of flourishing ones”; Vulg., “of rejoicing ones.” But the mistake is a happy one, and Milton’s sonorous lines have well caught the feeling and music of the Hebrew:—<p>“About His chariots numberless were poured<p>Cherub and seraph, potentates and thrones,<p>And virtues, winged spirits and chariots winged,<p>From the armoury of God, where stand of old<p>Myriads.” <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost, </span>vii. 196.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/68.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm" title="The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.">Psalm 68:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">The chariots of God are twenty thousand — </span>Nor let the heathen boast of their hosts or armies, or of the multitude of their chariots, wherein chiefly their strength consists; for in Zion there are ten thousand times more, even innumerable hosts of angels, who attend upon God, to do his pleasure, and to fight for him and for his people. <span class="ital">Twenty thousand </span>here stands for an innumerable company, a certain number being put for an uncertain. <span class="ital">The Lord is among them — </span>And here is not only the presence of the angels, but of the great and blessed God himself; <span class="ital">in Sinai as in the holy place — </span>God is no less gloriously, though less terribly, present here than he was in Sinai, when, attended with thousands of his angels, he solemnly appeared there to deliver the law. Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">סיני בקדשׁ</span>, <span class="ital">sinai bakodesh, </span>literally, Sinai is in the <span class="ital">sanctuary, </span>or <span class="ital">holy place, </span>which is a poetical, and a very emphatical expression, and very pertinent to this place. For, having advanced Zion above all other hills, he now equals it to that venerable hill of Sinai, which the divine majesty honoured with his glorious presence. Here, says he, you have, in some sort, mount Sinai itself, namely, all the glories and privileges of it, the presence of Jehovah, attended with his angels, and the same law and covenant, yea, and a greater privilege than Sinai had, to wit, the Lord descending from heaven into a human body, as appears by his ascending thither again, which the next verse describes. For here the psalmist seems evidently to be transported by the prophetic spirit, from the narration of those external successes and victories, of which he had been speaking in the former part of the Psalm, unto the prediction of higher and more glorious things, even of the coming of the Messiah, and of the happy and transcendent privileges and blessings accruing to mankind thereby. And the connection of this new matter with the former is sufficiently apparent. For the preference of Zion to other places having been stated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/68-15.htm" title="The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan....">Psalm 68:15-16</a>, he now proves its excellence by an invincible argument; it was the place to which the Lord of hosts himself, the Messiah, <span class="ital">God manifest in the flesh, </span>was to come; and, when he came, was to be attended by a multitude of angels, celebrating his birth, ministering to him in his temptation, attesting his resurrection, and accompanying him in his ascension.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>68:15-21 The ascension of Christ must here be meant, and thereto it is applied, Eph 4:8. He received as the purchase of his death, the gifts needful for the conversion of sinners, and the salvation of believers. These he continually bestows, even on rebellious men, that the Lord God might dwell among them, as their Friend and Father. He gave gifts to men. Having received power to give eternal life, the Lord Jesus bestows it on as many as were given him, Joh 17:2. Christ came to a rebellious world, not to condemn it, but that through him it might be saved. The glory of Zion's King is, that he is a Saviour and Benefactor to all his willing people, and a consuming fire to all that persist in rebellion against him. So many, so weighty are the gifts of God's bounty, that he may be truly said to load us with them. He will not put us off with present things for a portion, but will be the God of our salvation. The Lord Jesus has authority and power to rescue his people from the dominion of death, by taking away the sting of it from them when they die, and giving them complete victory over it when they rise again. The crown of the head, the chief pride and glory of the enemy, shall be smitten; Christ shall crush the head of the serpent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/68.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chariots of God - The meaning of this verse is, that God is abundantly able to maintain his position on Mount Zion; to defend the place which he had selected as his abode. Though it has less natural strength than many other places have - though other hills and mountains, on account of their natural grandeur, may be represented as looking on this with contempt, as incapable of defense, yet he who has selected it is fully able to defend it. He is himself encompassed with armies and chariots of war; thousands of angels guard the place which he has chosen as the place of his abode. "Chariots," usually two-wheeled vehicles, often armed with scythes attached to their axles, were among the most powerful means of attack or defense in ancient warfare. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>, note; Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-15.htm">Judges 4:15</a>.<p>Are twenty thousand - A closer version is "two myriads," or twice ten thousand.

A myriad was a great number; the idea here is that even "that" great number was doubled.<p>Even thousands of angels - Margin, "many thousands." The Hebrew is, "thousands repeated," or "multiplied." There is in the Hebrew no mention of angels. The Septuagint and the Vulgate render it, "thousands of the rejoicing;" that is, thousands of happy attendants. The original, however, would most naturally refer to the chariots, as being multiplied by thousands.<p>The Lord is among them - The real strength, after all, is not in Zion itself, or in the chariots of the Lord surrounding it, but in the Lord himself. "He" is there as the Head of the host; He, as the Protector of his chosen dwelling-place.<p>As in Sinai, in the holy place - literally, "The Lord is among them; Sinai, in the sanctuary." The idea seems to be, that even Sinai with all its splendor and glory - the Lord himself with all the attending hosts that came down on Sinai - seemed to be in the sanctuary, the holy place on Mount Zion. All that there was of pomp and grandeur on Mount Sinai when God came down with the attending thousands of angels, was really around Mount Zion for its protection and defense. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/68.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. and, to the assertion of God's purpose to make it His dwelling, is added evidence of His protecting care. He is described as in the midst of His heavenly armies&#8212;<p>thousands of angels&#8212;literally, "thousands of repetitions," or, "thousands of thousands"&#8212;that is, of chariots.

By which are meant the angels, as the following clause shows; called "chariots", because they have appeared in such a form, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>; and because, like chariots of war, they are the strength and protection of the Lord's people; and because of their swiftness in doing his work; and because they are for his honour and glory: they are the chariots of God, in which he rides about the world doing his will; they are the chariots in which Christ ascended up to heaven, and in which he will descend at the last day; and in which he now fetches the souls of his people to him at death, and will make use of them at the resurrection to gather them to him, when their bodies are raised by him: their number is very great, and in other places is mentioned as greater, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; Christ speaks of twelve legions of them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>; there is a multitude of them, and they are said to be even innumerable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>; which is observed, both for the glory of God, and for the safety of his people: even "thousands of angels"; the word for "angels" is only used in this place; Kimchi and Ben Melech take it to be one of the names of angels by which they were called: some derive it from a word which signifies "peaceable and quiet"; as expressive of the tranquil state in which they are in heaven, always beholding the face of God there: others from a word which signifies "sharp", as Jarchi; and so refers to their being the executioners of God's wrath and vengeance on men, and alluding to a sort of chariots with sharp hooks used in war: others from a word which signifies to "second"; these being the second, or next to God, the chief princes; or, as Aben Ezra, it denotes the number of angels, even "two thousand"; so the Targum, <p>"the chariots of God are two myriads (or twenty thousand) of burning fires, two thousand of angels lead them;'' <p>the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the holy place; that is, at the head of them, being their Governor and Commander, at whose beck they are, and ready to do his will; and he was among them when he ascended to heaven, as it follows, being carried up by them; as he was among them at Sinai, when the law was given; for Christ was there then, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; and attended with ten thousands of his holy angels, by whom the law was ordained, spoken, and given, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; which Sinai is called the holy place, from the presence of God there, and the law given from it: or else the sense is, that Christ is among the angels as in Sinai of old; so in the holy place, in Sion his holy hill, the church under the Gospel dispensation, where there are an innumerable company of angels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>; according to the construction of the word in the Hebrew text, it seems as if Sinai was in the holy place, the inside of it being of cedar, like the Shittim wood that grew about Sinai (l); or rather the worship commanded and directed to on mount Sinai was performed in it. <p>(l) Vid.

The chariots of God are in myriads, yea thousands upon thousands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God is represented as entering Zion in triumph with a vast retinue of the heavenly hosts. His chariots are not simply ‘twice ten thousand’ but ‘counted by tens of thousands’ (this is the idiomatic force of the dual termination), explained further as ‘thousands of repetition,’ i.e. thousands upon thousands. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm" title="A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.">Daniel 7:10</a>. The A.V. <span class="ital">angels</span> is traceable ultimately to the paraphrase of the Targ., suggested by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, but resting on no philological basis. The LXX <span class="greekheb">χιλιάδες εὐθηνούντων</span>, Vulg. <span class="ital">millia laetantium</span>, ‘thousands of joyous ones,’ presumes a slightly different reading, but was probably intended to give the same meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Lord</span> is <span class="ital">among them</span>, as in <span class="ital">Sinai</span>, <span class="ital">in the holy</span> place] Or, in the sanctuary (R.V.); or in holiness. But as the words <span class="ital">as in</span> are not in the text, the rendering Sinai is in the sanctuary (R.V. marg.), or, It is Sinai in holiness, is preferable. With either rendering the sense will be substantially the same. The glory and majesty which were revealed at Sinai are now transferred to God’s new abode. He comes surrounded as it were by an environment of holiness. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>. For the use of the name of a place to convey all the associations of the place cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-5.htm" title="O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal; that you may know the righteousness of the LORD.">Micah 6:5</a>, where “remember from Shittim unto Gilgal” means “remember all that happened there and in the interval.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Many commentators adopt a slight emendation of the text, and read The Lord is come from Sinai into the sanctuary (or, in holiness), a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>. From Sinai, the scene of His first great self-revelation to Israel, He comes to Zion, which He has chosen for His permanent abode. But the corruption of the text if it is faulty must be anterior to all existing versions: and the proposed reading has a somewhat prosaic ring.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels.</span> Another abrupt transition. The psalmist sees God move from Sinai, where he had represented him as present in ver. 8, into the sanctuary of Mount Zion. He is, of course, accompanied by his angelic host. This is described as a host of chariots (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>) -twenty thousand in number, and "thousands of repetition" - or thousands multiplied by thousands, as Hengstenberg understands the phrase (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">is among them;</span> or, "in their midst." <span class="cmt_word">As in Sinai, in the holy place;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Sinai is in the sanctuary</span>.

Moreover the transition to the language of address in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a> shows that the poet here looks forth from his present time and circumstances into the future; and the introduction of the divine name &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, after Elohim has been used eleven times, is an indication of a new commencement. The prosperous condition in which God places His church by giving it the hostile powers of the world as a spoil is depicted. The noun &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, never occurring in the genitival relationship, and never with a suffix, because the specific character of the form would be thereby obliterated, always denotes an important utterance, more particularly God's word of promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-9.htm">Psalm 77:9</a>), or His word of power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>), which is represented elsewhere as a mighty voice of thunder (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>), or a trumpet-blast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>); in the present instance it is the word of power by which the Lord suddenly changes the condition of His oppressed church. The entirely new state of things which this omnipotent behest as it were conjures into existence is presented to the mind in v. 12b: the women who proclaim the tidings of victory - a great host. Victory and triumph follow upon God's &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, as upon His creative &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;. The deliverance of Israel from the army of Pharaoh, the deliverance out of the hand of Jabin by the defeat of Sisera, the victory of Jephthah over the Ammonites, and the victorious single combat of David with Goliath were celebrated by singing women. God's decisive word shall also go forth this time, and of the evangelists, like Miriam (Mirjam) and Deborah, there shall be a great host.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a> describes the subject of this triumphant exultation. Hupfeld regards <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13-15</a> as the song of victory itself, the fragment of an ancient triumphal ode (epinikion) reproduced here; but there is nothing standing in the way that should forbid our here regarding these verses as a direct continuation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a>. The "hosts" are the numerous well-equipped armies which the kings of the heathen lead forth to the battle against the people of God. The unusual expression "kings of hosts" sounds very much like an ironically disparaging antithesis to the customary "Jahve of Hosts" (Bttcher). He, the Lord, interposes, and they are obliged to flee, staggering as they go, to retreat, and that, as the anadiplosis (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-7.htm">Judges 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-20.htm">Judges 19:20</a>) depicts, far away, in every direction. The fut. energicum with its ultima-accentuation gives intensity to the pictorial expression. The victors then turn homewards laden with rich spoils. &#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, here in a collective sense, is the wife who stays at home (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-24.htm">Judges 5:24</a>) while the husband goes forth to battle. It is not: the ornament (&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-2.htm">Jeremiah 6:2</a>) of the house, which Luther, with the lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac, adopts in his version, <p>(Note: "Hausehre," says he, is the housewife or matron as being the adornment of the house; vid., F. Dietrich, Frau und Dame, a lecture bearing upon the history of language (1864), S. 13.)<p>but: the dweller or homely one (cf. &#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, a dwelling-lace, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-6.htm">Job 8:6</a>) of the house, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. The dividing of the spoil elsewhere belongs to the victors; what is meant here is the distribution of the portions of the spoil that have fallen to the individual victors, the further distribution of which is left for the housewife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>). Ewald now recognises in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>. the words of an ancient song of victory; but v. 13b is unsuitable to introduce them. The language of address in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a> is the poet's own, and he here describes the condition of the people who are victorious by the help of their God, and who again dwell peaceably in the land after the war. &#1488;&#1501; passes out of the hypothetical signification into the temporal, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a> (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a>). The lying down among the sheep-folds (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, the staked-in folds or pens consisting of hurdles standing two by two over against one another) is an emblem of thriving peace, which (like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>) points back to Deborah's song, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-14.htm">Genesis 49:14</a>. Just such a time is now also before Israel, a time of peaceful prosperity enhanced by rich spoils. Everything shall glitter and gleam with silver and gold. Israel is God's turtle-dove, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a>. Hence the new circumstances of ease and comfort are likened to the varied hues of a dove disporting itself in the sun. Its wings are as though overlaid with silver (&#1504;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, not 3. praet, but part. fem. Niph. as predicate to &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-15.htm">1 Samuel 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>; Ew. 317 a), therefore like silver wings (cf. Ovid, Metam. ii.:537: Niveis argentea pennis Ales); and its pinions with gold-green,  <p>(Note: Ewald remarks, "Arabian poets also call the dove Arab. 'l-wrq'a&#770;, the greenish yellow, golden gleaming one, vid., Kosegarten, Chrestom. p. 156, 5." But this Arabic poetical word for the dove signifies rather the ash-green, whity blackish one. Nevertheless the signification greenish for the Hebrew &#1497;&#1512;&#1511;&#1512;&#1511; is established. Bartenoro, on Negaim xi. 4, calls the colour of the wings of the peacock &#1497;&#1512;&#1511;&#1512;&#1511;; and I am here reminded of what Wetzstein once told me, that, according to an Arab proverb, the surface of good coffee ought to be "like the neck of the dove," i.e., so oily that it gleams like the eye of a peacock. A way for the transition from green to grey in aurak as the name of a colour is already, however, opened up in post-biblical Hebrew, when to frighten any one is expressed by &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;, Genesis Rabba, 47a. The intermediate notions that of fawn colour, i.e., yellowish grey. In the Talmud the plumage of the full-grown dove is called &#1494;&#1492;&#1493;&#1489; and &#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1489;, Chullin, 22b.)<p>and that, as the reduplicated form implies, with the iridescent or glistening hue of the finest gold (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, not dull, but shining gold).<p>Side by side with this bold simile there appears in v. 15 an equally bold but contrastive figure, which, turning a step or two backward, likewise vividly illustrates the results of their God-given victory. The suffix of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers to the land of Israel, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-9.htm">Isaiah 65:9</a>. &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1501;, according to the usage of the language so far as it is now preserved to us, is not a common noun: deep darkness (Targum  equals  &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;), it is the name of a mountain in Ephraim, the trees of which Abimelech transported in order to set fire to the tower of Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-48.htm">Judges 9:48</a>.). The Talmudic literature was acquainted with a river taking its rise there, and also somewhat frequently mentions a locality bearing a similar name to that of the mountain. The mention of this mountain may in a general way be rendered intelligible by the consideration that, like Shiloh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), it is situated about in the centre of the Holy Land.<p>(Note: In Tosifta Para, ch. viii., a river of the name of &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514; &#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is mentioned, the waters of which might not be used in preparing the water of expiation (&#1502;&#1497; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;), because they were dried up at the time of the war, and thereby hastened the defeat of Israel (viz., the overthrow of Barcochba). Grtz "Geschichte der Juden, iv. 157, 459f.) sees in it the Nahar Arsuf, which flows down the mountains of Ephraim past Bethar into the Mediterranean. The village of Zalmon occurs in the Mishna, Jebamoth xvi. 6, and frequently. The Jerusalem Gemara (Maaseroth i. 1) gives pre-eminence to the carob-trees of Zalmona side by side with those of Shitta and Gadara.) <p>&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490; signifies to bring forth snow, or even, like Arab. at&#817;lj, to become snow-white; this Hiph. is not a word descriptive of colour, like &#1492;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;. Since the protasis is &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, and not &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1490; is intended to be impersonal (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-3.htm">Psalm 50:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/4-7.htm">Amos 4:7</a>, Mich. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>); and the voluntative form is explained from its use in apodoses of hypothetical protases (Ges. 128, 2). It indicates the issue to which, on the supposition of the other, it must and shall come. The words are therefore to be rendered: then it snows on Zalmon; and the snowing is either an emblem of the glistening spoil that falls into their hands in such abundance, or it is a figure of the becoming white, whether from bleached bones (cf. Virgil, Aen. v. 865: albi ossibus scopuli; xii. 36: campi ossibus albent; Ovid, Fasti i.:558: humanis ossibus albet humus) or even from the naked corpses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;). Whether we consider the point of comparison to lie in the spoil being abundant as the flakes of snow, and like to the dazzling snow in brilliancy, or in the white pallid corpses, at any rate &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is not equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, but what follows "when the Almighty scatters kings therein" is illustrated by Zalmon itself. In the one case Zalmon is represented as the battle-ground (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-6.htm">Psalm 110:6</a>), in the other (which better corresponds to the nature of a wooded mountain) as a place of concealment. The protasis &#1489;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; favours the latter; for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; signifies to spread wide apart, to cause a compact whole - and the host of "the kings" is conceived of as such - to fly far asunder into many parts (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-10.htm">Zechariah 2:10</a>, cf. the Niph. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-21.htm">Ezekiel 17:21</a>). The hostile host disperses in all directions, and Zalmon glitters, as it were with snow, from the spoil that is dropped by those who flee. Homer also (Iliad, xix. 357-361) likens the mass of assembled helmets, shields, armour, and lances to the spectacle of a dense fall of snow. In this passage of the Psalm before us still more than in Homer it is the spectacle of the fallen and far seen glistening snow that also is brought into the comparison, and not merely that which is falling and that which covers everything (vid., Iliad, xii. 277ff.). The figure is the pendant of the figure of the dove.<p>(Note: Wetzstein gives a different explanation (Reise in den beiden Trachonen und um das Haura equals ngebirge in the Zeitscheift fr allgem. Erdkunde, 1859, S. 198). "Then fell snow on Zalmon, i.e., the mountain clothed itself in a bright garment of light in celebration of this joyous event. Any one who has been in Palestine knows how very refreshing is the spectacle of the distant mountain-top capped with snow. The beauty of this poetical figure is enhanced by the fact that Zalmon (Arab. d&#817;lma&#770;n), according to its etymology, signifies a mountain range dark and dusky, either from shade, forest, or black rock. The last would well suit the mountains of Haurn, among which Ptolemaeus (p. 365 and 370, Ed. Wilberg) mentions a mountain (according to one of the various readings) &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;.") </body></html>
