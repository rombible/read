The powers of nature, be they ever so strong, so stormy, do what God appoints them, and no more. Those that rebel against God's word, show themselves to be more violent than even the stormy winds, yet they fulfil it. View the surface of the earth, mountains and all hills; from the barren tops of some, and the fruitful tops of others, we may fetch matter for praise. And assuredly creatures which have the powers of reason, ought to employ themselves in praising God. Let all manner of persons praise God. Those of every rank, high and low. Let us show that we are his saints by praising his name continually. He is not only our Creator, but our Redeemer; who made us a people near unto him. We may by the Horn of his people understand Christ, whom God has exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, who is indeed the defence and the praise of all his saints, and will be so for ever. In redemption, that unspeakable glory is displayed, which forms the source of all our hopes and joys. May the Lord pardon us, and teach our hearts to love him more and praise him better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/148.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Kings of the earth, and all people - This would embrace all, as all are included in the idea of the rulers and the ruled.<p>Princes, and all judges of the earth - Those of exalted rank; those high in authority.

The order of the creation is pretty much observed throughout the whole of this account; and as man was made last of all, so here he is called upon last to praise the Lord; and the chief among men are begun with, "the kings of the earth", of the several nations of the earth divided into kingdoms, over which some are set as supreme: and these have reason to praise the Lord, who has raised them to such dignity, for promotion comes not by chance, but by the Lord, who sets up kings and puts them down at his pleasure; and also for those gifts bestowed upon them, qualifying them for government, for it is by him kings reign and princes decree justice; and likewise for the preservation of them, for it is he that gives salvation to kings, and continues them for usefulness, notwithstanding all plots and conspiracies against them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-9.htm">Psalm 144:9</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>; "and all people"; their subjects, as they should submit unto them and pray for them, so should praise the Lord on their account, when they rule well, protect and defend them in their persons, property, and liberties, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>; <p>princes, and all judges of the earth: the sons of kings, princes of the blood, heirs of the crown; or nobles, ministers of state, counsellors, and, all subordinate magistrates, who are in high places of honour, profit, and trust, and so should praise the Lord, by whom they are brought to such honour; and when they fill up their places, and discharge their trust aright, the people have reason to be thankful for them; and especially for the "judges of the earth", when they are men fearing God and hating covetousness, and impartially minister justice and judgment; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/148.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{g}</span> Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:</span><p>(g) For the greater gifts that any has received and the more high that one is preferred, the more bound is he to praise God for the same: but neither high nor low condition or degree can be exempted from this duty.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/148.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11, 12</span>.

The place whence, before all others, the praise is to resound is the heavens; it is to resound in the heights, viz., the heights of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-2.htm">Job 25:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-2.htm">Job 31:2</a>). The &#1502;&#1503; might, it is true, also denote the birth or origin: ye of the heavens, i.e., ye celestial beings (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a>), but the parallel &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; renders the immediate construction with &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; more natural. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2-4</a> tell who are to praise Jahve there: first of all, all His angels, the messengers of the Ruler of the world - all His host, i.e., angels and stars, for &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493; (Cheth&#1502;b) or &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493; (Ker&#1502; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>) is the name of the heavenly host armed with light which God Tsebaoth commands (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1</a>), - a name including both stars (e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>) and angels (e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>); angels and stars are also united in the Scriptures in other instances (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>). When the psalmist calls upon these beings of light to praise Jahve, he does not merely express his delight in that which they do under any circumstances (Hengstenberg), but comprehends the heavenly world with the earthly, the church above with the church here below (vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>), and gives a special turn to the praise of the former, making it into an echo of the praise of the latter, and blending both harmoniously together. The heavens of heavens are, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>, Sir. 16:18, and frequently, those which lie beyond the heavens of the earth which were created on the fourth day, therefore they are the outermost and highest spheres. The waters which are above the heavens are, according to Hupfeld, "a product of the fancy, like the upper heavens and the whole of the inhabitants of heaven." But if in general the other world is not a notion to which there is no corresponding entity, this notion may also have things for its substance which lie beyond our knowledge of nature. The Scriptures, from the first page to the last, acknowledge the existence of celestial waters, to which the rain-waters stand in the relation as it were of a finger-post pointing upwards (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-7.htm">Genesis 1:7</a>). All these beings belonging to the superterrestrial world are to praise the Name of Jahve, for He, the God of Israel, it is by whose fiat (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>)<p>(Note: The interpolated parallel member, &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, here in the lxx is taken over from that passage.))<p>the heavens and all their host are created (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>). He has set them, which did not previously exist, up (&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; as e.g., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-7.htm">Nehemiah 6:7</a>, the causative to &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a>), and that for ever and ever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-8.htm">Psalm 111:8</a>), i.e., in order for ever to maintain the position in the whole of creation which He has assigned to them. He hath given a law (&#1495;&#1511;) by which its distinctive characteristic is stamped upon each of these heavenly beings, and a fixed bound is set to the nature and activity of each in its mutual relation to all, and not one transgresses (the individualizing singular) this law given to it. Thus &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512; is to be understood, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-10.htm">Job 38:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-9.htm">Psalm 104:9</a>. Hitzig makes the Creator Himself the subject; but then the poet would have at least been obliged to say &#1495;&#1511;&#1470;&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;, and moreover it may be clearly seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-36.htm">Jeremiah 31:36</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20</a>, how the thought that God inviolably keeps the orders of nature in check is expressed &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>, by way of example, shows that the law itself is not, with Ewald, Maurer, and others, following the lxx, Syriac, Italic, Jerome, and Kimchi, to be made the subject: a law hath He given, and it passes not away (an imperishable one). In combination with &#1495;&#1511;, &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; always signifies "to pass over, transgress."  </body></html>
