While poetically all the universe, inanimate as well as animate, all men, heathen as well as Hebrews, can be called to sing “hallelujah,” it remains as it has ever been, the covenant privilege of Israel. This explanation disposes at once of the charge which has been brought against this verse of narrowing a grand universal anthem, and ending the psalm with an anti-climax.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/148.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>148:7-14 Even in this world, dark and bad as it is, God is praised. The powers of nature, be they ever so strong, so stormy, do what God appoints them, and no more. Those that rebel against God's word, show themselves to be more violent than even the stormy winds, yet they fulfil it. View the surface of the earth, mountains and all hills; from the barren tops of some, and the fruitful tops of others, we may fetch matter for praise. And assuredly creatures which have the powers of reason, ought to employ themselves in praising God. Let all manner of persons praise God. Those of every rank, high and low. Let us show that we are his saints by praising his name continually. He is not only our Creator, but our Redeemer; who made us a people near unto him. We may by the Horn of his people understand Christ, whom God has exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, who is indeed the defence and the praise of all his saints, and will be so for ever. In redemption, that unspeakable glory is displayed, which forms the source of all our hopes and joys. May the Lord pardon us, and teach our hearts to love him more and praise him better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/148.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He also exalteth the horn of his people - He gives them power and prosperity.

Here too &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, like &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1</a>, is intended of the place whence the praise is to resound, and not according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-18.htm">Psalm 10:18</a> of earthly beings. The call is addressed in the first instance to the sea-monsters or dragons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>), i.e., as Pindar (Nem. iii. 23f.) expresses it, &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#836; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;'&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, and to the surging mass of waters (&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;) above and within the earth. Then to four phenomena of nature, coming down from heaven and ascending heavenwards, which are so arranged in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>, after the model of the chiasmus (crosswise position), that fire and smoke (&#1511;&#1496;&#1493;&#1512;), more especially of the mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), hail and snow stand in reciprocal relation; and to the storm-wind (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1505;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, an appositional construction, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25</a>), which, beside a seeming freeness and untractableness, performs God's word. What is said of this last applies also to the fire, etc.; all these phenomena of nature are messengers and servants of God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>. When the poet wishes that they all may join in concert with the rest of the creatures to the praise of God, he excepts the fact that they frequently become destructive powers executing judicial punishment, and only has before his mind their (more especially to the inhabitant of Palestine, to whom the opportunity of seeing hail, snow, and ice was more rare than with us, imposing) grandeur and their relatedness to the whole of creation, which is destined to glorify God and to be itself glorified. He next passes over to the mountains towering towards the skies and to all the heights of earth; to the fruit-trees, and to the cedars, the kings among the trees of the forest; to the wild beasts, which are called &#1495;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; because they represent the most active and powerful life in the animal world, and to all quadrupeds, which, more particularly the four-footed domestic animals, are called &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;; to the creeping things (&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;) which cleave to the ground as they move along; and to the birds, which are named with the descriptive epithet winged (&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-17.htm">Deuteronomy 4:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-14.htm">Genesis 7:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>, instead of &#1506;&#1493;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>). And just as the call in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a> finds its centre of gravity, so to speak, at last in the soul of man, so here it is addressed finally to humanity, and that, because mankind lives in nations and is comprehended under the law of a state commonwealth, in the first instance to its heads: the kings of the earth, i.e., those who rule over the earth by countries, to the princes and all who have the administration of justice and are possessed of supreme power on the earth, then to men of both sexes and of every age.<p>All the beings mentioned from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1</a> onwards are to praise the Name of Jahve; for His Name, He (the God of this Name) alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a>) is &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;, so high that no name reaches up to Him, not even from afar; His glory (His glorious self-attestation) extends over earth and heaven (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, without our being able and obliged to decide which, introduces the matter and the ground of the praise; and the fact that the desire of the poet comprehends in &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; all the beings mentioned is seen from his saying "earth and heaven," as he glances back from the nearer things mentioned to those mentioned farther off (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-14.htm">Psalm 148:14</a> the statement of the object and of the ground of the praise is continued. The motive from which the call to all creatures to Hallelujah proceeds, viz., the new mercy which God has shown towards His people, is also the final ground of the Hallelujah which is to sound forth; for the church of God on earth is the central-point of the universe, the aim of the history of the world, and the glorifying of this church is the turning-point for the transformation of the world. It is not to be rendered: He hath exalted the horn of His people, any more than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a> : I will make the horn of David to shoot forth. The horn in both instances is one such as the person named does not already possess, but which is given him (different from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-25.htm">Psalm 89:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-11.htm">Psalm 92:11</a>, and frequently). The Israel of the Exile had lost its horn, i.e., its comeliness and its defensive and offensive power. God has now given it a horn again, and that a high one, i.e., has helped Israel to attain again an independence among the nations that commands respect. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/132.htm">Psalm 132</a>, where the horn is an object of the promise, we might directly understand by it the Branch (Zemach). Here, where the poet speaks out of his own present age, this is at least not the meaning which he associates with the words. What now follows is an apposition to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;: He has raised up a horn for His people - praise (we say: to the praise of; cf. the New Testament &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) to all His saints, the children of Israel, the people who stand near Him. Others, as Hengstenberg, take &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; as a second object, but we cannot say &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;. Israel is called &#1506;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;, the people of His near  equals  of His nearness or vicinity (Kster), as Jerusalem is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:10</a> &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; instead of &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; (Ew. 287, a, b). It might also be said, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>, &#1506;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;, the nation of those who are near to Him (as the Targum renders it). In both instances &#1506;&#1501; is the governing noun, as, too, surely &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is in &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; ni, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, which need not signify, by going back to the abstract primary signification of &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, a man of my near fellowship, but can also signify a man of my neighbour, i.e., my nearest man, according to Ew. loc. cit. (cf. above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-10.htm">Psalm 145:10</a>). As a rule, the principal form of &#1506;&#1501; is pointed &#1506;&#1501;; and it is all the more unnecessary, with Olshausen and Hupfeld, to take the construction as adjectival for &#1506;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1493;. It might, with Hitzig after Aben-Ezra, be more readily regarded as appositional (to a people, His near, i.e., standing near to Him). We have here an example of the genitival subordination, which is very extensive in Hebrew, instead of an appositional co-ordination: populo propinqui sui, in connection with which propinqui may be referred back to propinquum  equals  propinquitas, but also to propinquus (literally: a people of the kind of one that is near to Him). Thus is Israel styled in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>. In the consciousness of the dignity which lies in this name, the nation of the God of the history of salvation comes forward in this Psalm as the leader (choragus) of all creatures, and strikes up a Hallelujah that is to be followed by heaven and earth. </body></html>
