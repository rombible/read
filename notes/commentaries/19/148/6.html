It is the imperishable faithfulness of God that renders the law invariable. See the remarkable passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-36.htm" title="If those ordinances depart from before me, said the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.">Jeremiah 31:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-20.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;">Jeremiah 33:20</a>, from winch we conclude that a covenant was supposed to have been made between God and nature as between Jehovah and Israel, the one being as imperishable as the other. A comparison of the two passages referred to shows that the Hebrew words <span class= "ital">ordinance </span>and <span class= "ital">covenant </span>might be used synonymously. The Authorised Version, which, following the LXX. and Vulg., makes the ordinance itself imperishable, violates the usage of the Hebrew verb.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/148.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>148:1-6 We, in this dark and sinful world, know little of the heavenly world of light. But we know that there is above us a world of blessed angels. They are always praising God, therefore the psalmist shows his desire that God may be praised in the best manner; also we show that we have communion with spirits above, who are still praising him. The heavens, with all contained in them, declare the glory of God. They call on us, that both by word and deed, we glorify with them the Creator and Redeemer of the universe.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/148.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hath also stablished them forever and ever - He has made them firm, stable, enduring. That they may be eternal is possible; that they will not be, no one can prove. Matter, when created, has no necessary tendency to decay or annihilation; and the universe - the stars, and suns, and systems - which have endured so many million of ages may continue to exist any number of million of ages to come. Of course, however, all this is dependent on the will of God. On the meaning of this passage, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-90.htm">Psalm 119:90</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36-37</a>, note.

The word rendered decree here seems to be used in the sense of limit or bound; and the idea is, that he has bound them by a fixed law; he has established laws which they are compelled to observe. The fact is, in regard to them, that he has established great laws - as the law of gravitation - by which they are held from flying off; he has marked out orbits in which they move; he has so bound them that they perform their revolutions with unerring accuracy in the very path which he has prescribed. So accurate are their movements that they can be predicted with exact precision; and so uniform, that any succession of ages does not vary or affect them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/148.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The call goes forth to the church again on the soil of the land of promise assembled round about Jerusalem. The holy city has again risen out of its ruins; it now once more has gates which can stand open in the broad daylight, and can be closed and bolted when the darkness comes on for the security of the municipality that is only just growing into power (<a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-1.htm">Nehemiah 7:1-4</a>). The blessing of God again rests upon the children of the sacred metropolis. Its territory, which has experienced all the sufferings of war, and formerly resounded with the tumult of arms and cries of woe and destruction, God has now, from being an arena of conflict, made into peace (the accusative of the effect, and therefore different from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>); and since the land can now again be cultivated in peace, the ancient promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-17.htm">Psalm 81:17</a>) is fulfilled, that God would feed His people, if they would only obey Him, with the fat of wheat. The God of Israel is the almighty Governor of nature. It is He who sends His fiat (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; after the manner of the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; of the history of creation, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>) earthwards (&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the accusative of the direction). The word is His messenger (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>), &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, i.e., it runs as swiftly as possible, viz., in order to execute the errand on which it is sent. He it is who sends down snow-flakes like flocks of wool, so that the fields are covered with snow as with a white-woollen warming covering.<p>(Note: Bochart in his Hierozoicon on this passage compares an observation of Eustathius on Dionysius Periegetes: &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;.)<p>He scatters hoar-frost (&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;, to cover over with the fine frozen dew or mist as though they were powdered with ashes that the wind had blown about. Another time He casts His ice<p>(Note: lxx (Italic, Vulgate) &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., ice, from the root &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;, to freeze, to congeal (Jerome glaciem). Quid est crystallum? asks Augustine, and replies: Nix est glacie durata per multos annos ita ut a sole vel igne acile dissolvi non possit.)<p>(&#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; from &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;; or according to another reading, &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; from &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;) down like morsels, fragments, &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, viz., as hail-stones, or as sleet. The question: before His cold - who can stand? is formed as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>. It further comes to pass that God sends forth His word and causes them (snow, hoar-frost, and ice) to melt away: He makes His thawing wind blow, waters flow; i.e., as soon as the one comes about, the other also takes place forthwith. This God now, who rules all things by His word and moulds all things according to His will, is the God of the revelation pertaining to the history of salvation, which is come to Israel, and as the bearer of which Israel takes the place of honour among the nations, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>., 32-34. Since the poet says &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; and not &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, he is thinking not only of the Tra, but also of prophecy as the continuous self-attestation of God, the Lawgiver. The Ker &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, occasioned by the plurals of the parallel member of the verse, gives an unlimited indistinct idea. We must keep to &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;, with the lxx, Aquila, Theodotion, the Quinta, Sexta, and Jerome. The word, which is the medium of God's cosmical rule, is gone forth as a word of salvation to Israel, and, unfolding itself in statutes and judgments, has raised Israel to a legal state founded upon a positive divine law or judgment such as no Gentile nation possesses. The Hallelujah does not exult over the fact that these other nations are not acquainted with any such positive divine law, but (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>., Baruch 4:4) over the fact that Israel is put into possession of such a law. It is frequently attested elsewhere that this possession of Israel is only meant to be a means of making salvation a common property of the world at large. </body></html>
