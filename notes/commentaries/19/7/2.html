Such a change from plural to singular often occurs in the Psalms.

(so too the Syriac), take the verb in its primitive sense of “snatch away,” and translate, “there being none to redeem or deliver.” So Milton: “Tearing, and no rescue nigh.” Notice the comparison of human enemies to beasts of prey—a reminiscence of the lion and the bear of his youth, so constantly present to David. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-7.htm" title="Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for you have smitten all my enemies on the cheek bone; you have broken the teeth of the ungodly.">Psalm 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-37.htm" title="David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.

The singular number here used, evidently proves that one particular enemy is referred to, whom some suppose to be the great enemy and accuser, whose agents and tools wicked men are.

But Christ alone could call on Heaven to attest his uprightness in all things. All His works were wrought in righteousness; and the prince of this world found nothing whereof justly to accuse him. Yet for our sakes, submitting to be charged as guilty, he suffered all evils, but, being innocent, he triumphed over them all. The plea is, For the righteous God trieth the hearts and the reins. He knows the secret wickedness of the wicked, and how to bring it to an end; he is witness to the secret sincerity of the just, and has ways of establishing it. When a man has made peace with God about all his sins, upon the terms of grace and mercy, through the sacrifice of the Mediator, he may, in comparison with his enemies, appeal to God's justice to decide.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lest he - Lest "Cush" should do this. See the title, and the introduction to the psalm, Section 2.<p>Tear my soul like a lion - Tear or rend my "life" - that is, "me" - like a lion. The word rendered "soul" here - &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  nephesh - refers, as it properly does elsewhere, to the "life," and not to the soul, as we use the term, denoting the thinking, immortal part. The simple idea is, that David was apprehensive of his "life," and, in order to indicate his great peril, he uses language derived from the fierceness of the lion. Such imagery would be well understood in a country where lions abounded, and nothing could more strikingly denote the danger in which David was, or the fierceness of the wrath of the enemy that he dreaded.<p>Rending it in pieces - Rending me in pieces. Or rather, perhaps, breaking or crushing the bones, for the word used - &#1508;&#1512;&#1511;  pa&#770;raq (from our English word "break") - means "to break, to crush," and would apply to the act of the lion crushing or breaking the bones of his victim as he devoured it.<p>While there is none to deliver - Denoting the complete destruction which he feared would come upon him. The figure is that of a solitary man seized by a powerful lion, with no one at hand to rescue him. So David felt that if God did not interfere, he would fall into the hands of this fierce and wrathful enemy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 7<p>Ps 7:1-17. Shiggaion&#8212;a plaintive song or elegy. Though obscure in details, this title seems to intimate that the occasion of this Psalm was some event in David's persecution by Saul. He prays for relief because he is innocent, and God will be glorified in his vindication. He thus passes to the celebration of God's righteous government, in defending the upright and punishing the wicked, whose malignant devices will result in their own ruin; and, confident of God's aid, he closes with rejoicing.<p>1, 2. Though many enemies set upon him, one is singled out as prominent, and compared to a wild beast tearing his prey to pieces (compare 1Sa 20:1; 23:23; 26:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Lest he, </span> i.e. mine enemy, as it is expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-4.htm" title="If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (yes, I have delivered him that without cause is my enemy:)">Psalm 7:4</a></span>, even Saul, or any of his followers, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">tear my soul</span> out of my body; or destroy me and my life, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-5.htm" title="For in death there is no remembrance of you: in the grave who shall give you thanks?">Psalm 6:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Like a lion; </span> to which he compares him both for power and cruelty, and withal intimates his own inability to oppose or escape his rage without God’s almighty help. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">While there is none to deliver; </span> whilst I have no considerable force to defend myself, but am forced to flee to mountains, and caves, and woods for my safety. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Lest he tear my soul like a lion,.... That is, one of his persecutors, the chief of them; it may be Saul, whom the psalmist compares to a lion for his majesty and greatness, the lion being the king among beasts; and for his authority, power, and might, and for his wrath and cruelty, which he feared; and which, should it be exerted on him, would tear his soul, or himself, in pieces; would rend his soul from his body, and dispatch his life; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a>. So the Apostle Paul calls the Roman governor, before whom he was, and from whose hands he was delivered, a lion, for his power and fierceness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>. And so our adversary the devil, the chief of all persecutors, and who instigates others against the saints, is by Peter said to go about like a roaring lion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <p>rending it in pieces, as the lion does his prey when hungry. So Homer (s) compares Polyphemus to a mountain lion, which devours and leaves nothing, neither the intestines, nor flesh, nor bones; and represents (t) it first taking hold of the creature with its strong teeth, and breaking its neck, and drawing out its blood and all its inwards; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; <p>while there is none to deliver; no saviour, no deliverer: for if God does not save and deliver his people out of the hands of their persecutors, none can; especially out of the hands of such an one as is here described tearing and rending in pieces. As there is no God besides the Lord, there is no saviour besides him: there is no temporal nor spiritual saviour but he: salvation is not to be expected from any other; and were it not for him, saints must fall a prey to their enemies. <p>(s) Odyss. 9. v. 292, 293.

On both occasions David fears one special enemy - then probably Ahithophel, now Saul.

The writers of the Psalms all (which is no small objection against Maccabean Psalms) know only of one single gathering-place of the dead in the depth of the earth, where they indeed live, but it is only a quasi life, because they are secluded from the light of this world and, what is the most lamentable, from the light of God's presence. Hence the Christian can only join in the prayer of v. 6 of this Psalm and similar passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>.) so far as he transfers the notion of hades to that of gehenna.<p>(Note: An adumbration of this relationship of Christianity to the religion of the Old Testament is the relationship of Islam to the religion of the Arab wandering tribes, which is called the "religion of Abraham" (Din Ibra&#770;him), and knows no life after death; while Islam has taken from the later Judaism and from Christianity the hope of a resurrection and heavenly blessedness.)<p>In hell there is really no remembrance and no praising of God. David's fear of death as something in itself unhappy, is also, according to its ultimate ground, nothing but the fear of an unhappy death. In these "pains of hell" he is wearied with (&#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>) groaning, and bedews his couch every night with a river of tears. Just as the Hiph. &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1492; signifies to cause to swim from &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1492; to swim, so the Hiph. &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1492; signifies to dissolve, cause to melt, from &#1502;&#1505;&#1492; (cogn. &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;) to melt. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492;, in Arabic a nom. unit. a tear, is in Hebrew a flood of tears.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8</a> &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; does not signify my "appearance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>), but, as becomes clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-7.htm">Job 17:7</a>, "my eye;" the eye reflects the whole state of a man's health. The verb &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; appears to be a denominative from &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;: to be moth-eaten.<p>(Note: Reuchlin in his grammatical analysis of the seven Penitential Psalms, which he published in 1512 after his Ll. III de Rudimentis Hebraicis (1506), explains it thus: &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; Verminavit. Sic a vermibus dictum qui turbant res claras puras et nitidas, and in the Rudim. p. 412: Turbatus est a furore oculus meus, corrosus et obfuscatus, quasi vitro laternae obductus.)<p>The signification senescere for the verb &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; is more certain.
