The destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described, ver. 14-16, as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hath also prepared for him - The instruments of punishment are already prepared, and God can use them when he pleases. They are not to be made ready, and, therefore, there is no necessity for delay when he shall have occasion to use them. The idea is, that arrangements are made for the destruction of the wicked, and that the destruction must come upon them. The world is full of these arrangements, and it is impossible that the sinner should escape.<p>The instruments of death - The means of putting them to death; that is, of punishing them. The particular means referred to here are arrows, as being what God has prepared for the wicked. "Death" here is designed simply to denote punishment, as death would be inflicted by arrows.<p>He ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors - Or rather, as the Hebrew is, "He makes his arrows for burning," that is, "for burning arrows." Horsley renders it, "He putteth his arrows in action against those who are ready for burning." Prof. Alexander, "His arrows to (be) burning he will make." DeWette, "His arrows he makes burning." The Latin Vulgate and Septuagint, His arrows he has made for the burning: "that is, probably for those who are burning with rage, for persecutors. This seems to have been the idea of our translators. The Hebrew word - &#1491;&#1500;&#1511;  da&#770;laq - means to burn, to flame; and hence, also, to burn with love, with anxiety, or with zeal or wrath - as persecutors do. But here the word seems properly to be connected with "arrows;" and the sense is, as rendered by Gesenius, "he maketh his arrows flaming;" that is, burning - alluding to the ancient custom of shooting ignited darts or arrows into besieged towns or camps, for the purpose of setting them on fire, as well as for the purpose of inflicting greater personal injury. The sense is, that God had prepared the means of certain destruction for the wicked. The reference here is not necessarily to persecutors, but what is said here pertains to all the wicked unless they repent. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. against the persecutors&#8212;Some render "for burning," but the former is the best sense.

His vision widens and extends from the enemies immediately around to the whole world in its hostility towards Jahve and His anointed one. In the very same way special judgments and the judgment of the world are portrayed side by side, as it were on one canvas, in the prophets. The truth of this combination lies in the fact of the final judgment being only the finale of that judgment which is in constant execution in the world itself. The language here takes the highest and most majestic flight conceivable. By &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (Milra, ass in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>), which is one of David's words of prayer that he has taken from the lips of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>), he calls upon Jahve to interpose. The parallel is &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; lift Thyself up, show thyself in Thy majesty, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-2.htm">Psalm 94:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>. The anger, in which He is to arise, is the principle of His judicial righteousness. With this His anger He is to gird Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-11.htm">Psalm 76:11</a>) against the ragings of the oppressors of God's anointed one, i.e., taking vengeance on their many and manifold manifestations of hostility. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is a shorter form of the construct (instead of &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-11.htm">Job 40:11</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/21-1.htm">Psalm 21:1-13</a> :31) of &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; which describes the anger as running over, breaking forth from within and passing over into words and deeds (cf. Arab. fs&#780;s&#780;, used of water: it overflows the dam, of wrath: it breaks forth). It is contrary to the usage of the language to make &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; the object to &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; in opposition to the accents, and it is unnatural to regard it as the accus. of direction  equals  &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1496; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>), as Hitzig does. The accents rightly unite &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;: awake (stir thyself) for me i.e., to help me (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497; like &#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>). The view, that &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is then precative and equivalent to &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;: command judgment, is one that cannot be established according to syntax either here, or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-3.htm">Psalm 71:3</a>. It ought at least to have been &#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; with Waw consec. On the other hand the relative rendering: Thou who hast ordered judgment (Maurer, Hengst.), is admissible, but unnecessary. We take it by itself in a confirmatory sense, not as a circumstantial clause: having commanded judgment (Ewald), but as a co-ordinate clause: Thou hast indeed enjoined the maintaining of right (Hupfeld).<p>The psalmist now, so to speak, arranges the judgment scene: the assembly of the nations is to form a circle round about Jahve, in the midst of which He will sit in judgment, and after the judgment He is to soar away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>) aloft over it and return to the heights of heaven like a victor after the battle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>). Although it strikes one as strange that the termination of the judgment itself is not definitely expressed, yet the rendering of Hupfeld and others: sit Thou again upon Thy heavenly judgment-seat to judge, is to be rejected on account of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; (cf. on the other hand 21:14) which is not suited to it; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; can only mean Jahve's return to His rest after the execution of judgment. That which <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-7.htm">Psalm 7:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8</a> in the boldness of faith desire, the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a> expresses as a prophetic hope, from which proceeds the prayer, that the Judge of the earth may also do justice to him (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; vindica me, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-24.htm">Psalm 35:24</a>) according to his righteousness and the purity of which he is conscious, as dwelling in him. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is to be closely connected with &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, just as one says &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; (Psychol. S. 152 [tr. p. 180]). That which the individual as ego, distinguishes from itself as being in it, as subject, it denotes by &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;. In explaining it elliptically: "come upon me" (Ew., Olsh., Hupf.) this psychologically intelligible usage of the language is not recognised.
