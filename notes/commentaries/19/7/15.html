Saul was overthrown by those Philistines whom he would have made the instruments of cutting off David. Haman was hanged on his own gallows. The Jews, who excited the Romans to crucify Christ, were themselves, by the Romans, crucified in crowds.

The destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described, ver. 14-16, as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He made a pit - The allusion here is undoubtedly to a method of hunting wild beasts which was common in ancient times. It consists in digging a pit-fall, and covering it over with brush and grass so as to deceive the animals, and then enclosing them and driving them into it. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17</a>.<p>And digged it - And hollowed it out so as to be large enough to contain his prey, and so deep that he could not escape if he fell into it. The idea is, that the enemy here referred to had laid a secret and artful plan to destroy others. He meant that they should not be aware of his plan until the mischief came suddenly upon them. He was preparing to ruin them, and supposed that he was certain of his prey.<p>And is fallen into the ditch which he made - Into the pit-fall which he had constructed for others; as if a man who had made a pit-fall for wild beasts had himself fallen into it, and could not extricate himself. That is, he had been snared in his own devices; his cunning had recoiled on himself, and instead of bringing ruin on others he had only managed to bring it on himself. See this sentiment illustrated in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>. A remarkable instance of the kind may be found in Esther (<a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5.htm">Esther 5-7</a>), in the case of Haman. Indeed, such things are not uncommon in the world, where the cunning and the crafty are involved in the consequences of their own plans, and are taken in meshes from which they cannot free themselves. A straightforward course is easy, and men are safe in it; but it requires more skill than most men are endowed with to manage a crooked and crafty policy safely, or so as to be safe themselves in pursuing such a course. A spider will weave a web for flies with no danger to himself, for he is made for that, and acts as if he understood all the intricacies of his own web, and may move safely over it in every direction; but man was made to accomplish his purposes in an open and upright way, not by fraud and deceit; hence, when he undertakes a tortuous and crooked course - a plan of secret and scheming policy - in order to ruin others, it often becomes unmanageable by his own skill, or is suddenly sprung upon himself. No one can overvalue a straightforward course in its influence on our ultimate happiness; no one can overestimate the guilt and danger of a crooked and secret policy in devising plans of evil. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15, 16. 1Sa 18:17; 31:2 illustrate the statement whether alluded to or not.

There are several illustrations of this law of God's providence in Scripture, the most striking being that of Haman. Its existence <span class="accented">as a</span> law was noticed by some of the classical writers, as Ovid, who says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nec lex justior ulla est,<br />Quam necis artifices arte petite sua."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 7:10-11) In this strophe we hear the calm language of courageous trust, to which the rising and calmly subsiding caesural schema is particularly adapted. He is now concerned about the cessation of evil: Oh let it come to an end (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; intransitive as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-9.htm">Psalm 77:9</a>).... His prayer is therefore not directed against the individuals as such but against the wickedness that is in them. This Psalm is the key to all Psalms which contain prayers against one's enemies. Just in the same manner &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is intended to express a wish; it is one of the comparatively rare voluntatives of the 2 pers. (Ew. 229): and mayst Thou be pleased to establish.... To the termination of evil which is desired corresponds, in a positive form of expression, the desired security and establishment of the righteous, whom it had injured and whose continuance was endangered by it. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1503; is the beginning of a circumstantial clause, introduced by &#1493;, but without the personal pronoun, which is not unfrequently omitted both in the leading participial clause, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a> (which see), and in the minor participial clause as here (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>): cum sis  equals  quoniam es. The reins are the seat of the emotions, just as the heart is the seat of the thoughts and feelings. Reins and heart lie naked before God-a description of the only kardiognoo'stees, which is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>. In the thesis the adjective is used with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; in the sing. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-12.htm">Psalm 58:12</a>. God is the righteous God, and by his knowledge of the inmost part He is fully capable of always showing Himself both righteous in anger and righteous in mercy according to the requirements and necessity of the case. Therefore David can courageously add &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, my shield doth God carry; &#1500; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>) would signify: He has it, it (my shield) belongs to Him, &#1506;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>) signifies: He bears it, or if one takes shield in the sense of protection: He has taken my protection upon Himself, has undertaken it (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-20.htm">Judges 19:20</a>), as He is in general the Saviour of all who are devoted to Him with an upright heart, i.e., a heart sincere, guileless (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>). &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is intentionally repeated at the end of the first two lines - the favourite palindrome, found more especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>. And to the mixed character of this Psalm belongs the fact of its being both Elohimic and Jehovic. From the calm language of heartfelt trust in God the next strophe passes over into the language of earnest warning, which is again more excited and somewhat after the style of didactic poetry. </body></html>
