From metrical reasons, and also to avoid the abruptness of the change of construction, Ewald conjectures that two clauses have dropped out of the text, and restores as follows—<p>“If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me<p>(And cunning unto him that was at peace with me,<p>Yea, if I have not rewarded his soul with good).<p>And delivered him that without cause is my enemy.”<p>Milton’s translation gives yet another colour to the passage—<p>“If I have wrought<p>Ill to him that meant me peace,<p>Or to him have rendered less,<p>And not freed my foe for nought.”<p>The conjecture of a corruption of the text is supported by the rendering of the LXX. and Vulg., and a very slight change gives the probable rendering: “If I have returned evil to him that dealt friendly with me, and injured my enemy without cause.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-4.htm" title="If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (yes, I have delivered him that without cause is my enemy:)">Psalm 7:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me — </span>He probably means to Saul, when he was peaceable and friendly toward him; for David was charged with evil designs against Saul, before Saul broke out into open enmity against him. <span class="ital">Yea — </span>I have been so far from doing this that I have done the contrary; <span class="ital">I have delivered him — </span>When it was in my power to destroy him; <span class="ital">that without cause — </span>Without any provocation on my part, <span class="ital">is mine enemy — </span>It is probable that David alludes here to his preserving the life of Saul when he was pressed by his attendants to suffer them to take it away, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm" title="And he said to his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-8.htm" title="Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray you, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.">1 Samuel 26:8</a>, &c.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 David flees to God for succour. But Christ alone could call on Heaven to attest his uprightness in all things. All His works were wrought in righteousness; and the prince of this world found nothing whereof justly to accuse him. Yet for our sakes, submitting to be charged as guilty, he suffered all evils, but, being innocent, he triumphed over them all. The plea is, For the righteous God trieth the hearts and the reins. He knows the secret wickedness of the wicked, and how to bring it to an end; he is witness to the secret sincerity of the just, and has ways of establishing it. When a man has made peace with God about all his sins, upon the terms of grace and mercy, through the sacrifice of the Mediator, he may, in comparison with his enemies, appeal to God's justice to decide.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me - If I have done evil; or if I have requited him that was friendly by some unjust and evil conduct. If I have come upon him wantonly and unprovoked, and have done him wrong. This seems to have been the substance of the accusation; and, as remarked above, it is most probable that the accuser (Cush) referred to himself.<p>Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy - So far is this from being true, that the very reverse is true. So far from taking advantage of another that was at peace with me, and depriving him of his just rights by fraud or force, it is a fact that I have rescued from impending danger the man that was at war with me, and that was an avowed enemy. It would seem probable that in this he refers to this very Cush, and means to say that there had been some occasion in which he, who was long hostile to him, was wholly in his power, and when he had not only declined to take advantage of him, but had actually interposed to rescue him from danger. An instance of this kind actually occurred in the life of David, in his treatment of Saul <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-10.htm">1 Samuel 24:10-11</a>; and it is "possible" that David referred to that case, and meant to say that that was an indication of his character, and of his manner of treating others. Those who suppose that the whole psalm refers to Saul (see the introduction, Section 2), of course regard this as the specific case referred to. There may have been other instances of the same kind in the life of David, and there is no improbability in supposing that on some occasion he had treated this very man, "Cush," in this way, and that he refers here to that fact. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. If I have injured my friend.<p>yea, I have delivered, &c.&#8212;This makes a good sense, but interrupts the course of thought, and hence it is proposed to render, "if I have spoiled my enemy"&#8212;in either case (compare 1Sa 24:4-17; 31:8, 11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto him that was at peace with me, </span> i.e. to Saul, when he was peaceable and friendly towards me; for David was charged with evil designs against Saul before Saul broke out into open enmity against him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yea:</span> this particle is here used by way of correction or opposition, as it is also <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-16.htm" title="These six things does the LORD hate: yes, seven are an abomination to him:">Proverbs 6:16</a></span>.

That is, when Saul was at peace with him; when he lived at his court, and ate at his table his meaning is, that he did not conspire against him, nor form schemes to deprive him of his crown nor of his life: or, as it may be rendered, "if I have rewarded to him that rewarded me evil" (u); that is, as Jarchi explains it, if I rewarded him as he rewarded me, evil for evil. This David did not; and it is eminently true of Christ his antitype, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>; and in it he ought to be imitated by every believer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>; <p>yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy; meaning Saul, who persecuted David without any just reason, and whom David delivered without any obligation to do it; not for any benefit and kindness he had received from him; for the phrase "without cause" may be read in connection either with the word "delivered" (w); for the deliverance was wrought without any cause or merit on Saul's part, or profit to David; or with the word "enemy", for Saul was David's enemy without any just cause on David's part: and the deliverance referred to was when he cut off Saul's skirt, in the cave at Engedi, and spared his life; and when he took away his spear from him, as he was sleeping in the trench, and did not destroy him, nor suffer those that would to do it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4</a>. The words may be rendered, "only I stripped him" (x). The sense is, that he cut off the skirt of his coat, and took away his spear, and so in part stripped him both of his clothes and armour, at two different times; not to do him any hurt, but to let him know, as Jarchi observes, that he was delivered into his hands, and he could have slain him, but did not. The same Jewish writer interprets the word used "of stripping of garments"; and Aben Ezra observes, from R. Moses, that the "vau", rendered "yea", signifies "only", as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-10.htm">Genesis 42:10</a>. <p>(u) "Si malum malo rependi", Castalio.

This is probably right; but another possible rendering deserves mention: <span class="ital">If I have requited him that rewarded me evil</span>; i.e. taken revenge into my own hands. Cp. David’s solemn disclaimer of such conduct in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-12.htm" title="The LORD judge between me and you, and the LORD avenge me of you: but my hand shall not be on you.">1 Samuel 24:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy</span>] R.V., him that without cause was mine adversary, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm" title="Arise, O LORD, in your anger, lift up yourself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that you have commanded.">Psalm 7:6</a></span>. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-7.htm" title="My eye is consumed because of grief; it waxes old because of all my enemies.">Psalm 6:7</a>. The clause is a parenthesis, asserting that his conduct had been the very opposite of that which was attributed to him. Far from committing unprovoked outrages, he had saved the life of his enemy, and that though the enemy’s hostility to him was causeless. The words refer to the occasions in the cave and in the camp, when David prevented his followers from taking Saul’s life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm" title="And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privately.">1 Samuel 24:4</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-8.htm" title="Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray you, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.">1 Samuel 26:8</a> ff.). The construction is bold, but it is thoroughly in keeping with the style of the Psalm, with its passionate protestations of innocence; and there is no need to adopt an unsupported meaning of the word for ‘deliver,’ and render, not as a parenthesis but in direct continuation of the preceding clause, <span class="ital">and have spoiled him that without cause was mine adversary</span>, with a supposed reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/24-4.htm" title="And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privately....">1 Samuel 24:4-5</a>, or <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-11.htm" title="But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and be merciful to me.">Psalm 26:11</a> : or to alter the text by transposing two letters, so as to mean: <span class="ital">and oppressed mine adversary without cause</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me</span>. This is probably the true meaning. David denies that he has wantonly attacked and injured any one with whom he was on friendly and peaceable terms. No doubt he was accused of having estranged Saul by plotting to take the crown from him<span class="cmt_word">. (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy.)</span> This translation, which is retained by our Revisers, has the support also of Ewald, Hupfeld, Mr. Aglen, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.' If accepted, it must be considered as a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-7.htm">1 Samuel 24:7</a>, or else to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>, or both, and as a sort of parenthetic protest, "Nay, not only have I not injured a friend, but I have gone so far as to let my enemy escape me." A different meaning is, however, given to the passage by many critics, as Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Cheyne, etc., who regard the sense as running on without any parenthesis, and translate, "If I have oppressed him who without cause is mine enemy." David, according to this view, denies that he has either injured a friend or requited evil to a foe. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 6:9-11) Even before his plaintive prayer is ended the divine light and comfort come quickly into his heart, as Frisch says in his "Neuklingende Harfe Davids." His enemies mock him as one forsaken of God, but even in the face of his enemies he becomes conscious that this is not his condition. Thrice in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-10.htm">Psalm 6:10</a> his confidence that God will answer him flashes forth: He hears his loud sobbing, the voice of his weeping that rises towards heaven, He hears his supplication, and He graciously accepts his prayer.
