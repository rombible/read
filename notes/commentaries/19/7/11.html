The destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described, ver. 14-16, as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God judgeth the righteous - That is, he pronounces a just judgment on their behalf; he vindicates their character. It is true, in a general sense, that God judges all according to their character; but the particular idea here is, that God will do justice to the righteous; he will interpose to vindicate them, and he will treat them as they ought to be treated when assailed by their enemies, and when reproached and calumniated. The original phrase here is susceptible of two translations; either, "God is a righteous judge" or, "God is judging," that is judges, "the righteous." The sense is not materially varied, whichever translation is adopted. Our common version has probably expressed the true idea; and there the design of the writer is to contrast the manner in which God regards and treats the righteous, with the manner in which he regards and treats the wicked. The one he judges, that is, he does him justice; with the other he is angry every day.<p>And God is angry with the wicked - The phrase "with the wicked" is supplied by our translators, but not improperly, since the writer evidently intends to speak of these in contrast with the righteous. The words "God is angry" must, of course, be understood in a manner in accordance with the divine nature; and we are not to suppose that precisely the same passions, or the same feelings, are referred to when this language is used of God which is implied when it is used of people. It means that his nature, his laws, his government, his feelings, are all arrayed against the wicked; that he cannot regard the conduct of the wicked with favor; that he will punish them. While his judgment in regard to the righteous must be in their favor, it must just as certainly be against the wicked; while he will vindicate the one, he will cut off and punish the other. Of the truth of this in respect to the divine character there can be no doubt. Indeed, we could not honor a God - as we could honor no other being - who would deal with the righteous and the wicked alike, or who would have no respect to character in the treatment of others, and in his feelings toward them.<p>Every day - Continually; constantly; always. This is designed to quality the previous expression. It is not excitement. It is not temporary passion, such as we see in men. It is not sudden emotion, soon to be succeeded by a different feeling when the passion passes off. It is the steady and uniform attribute of his unchanging nature to be always opposed to the wicked - to all forms of sin; and in him, in this respect, there will be no change. The wicked will find him no more favorable to their character and course of life tomorrow than he is today; no more beyond the grave, than this side the tomb. What he is today he will be tomorrow and every day. Time will make no change in this respect, and the wicked can have no hope on the ground that the feeling of God toward sin and the sinner (as such) will ever be in any way different from what it is at the present moment. This is a fearful truth in regard to the sinner; and both aspects of the truth here stated should make the sinner tremble;<p>(a) that God is angry with him - that all His character, and all the principles of His govermnent and law, are and must be arrayed against him; and<p>(b) that in this respect there is to be no change; that if he continues to be wicked, as he is now, he will every day and always - this side the grave and beyond - find all the attributes of God engaged against him, and pledged to punish him.<p>God has no attribute that can take part with sin or the sinner. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. judgeth&#8212;as in Ps 7:8.<p>the wicked&#8212;Though not expressed, they are implied, for they alone are left as objects of anger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God judgeth, </span> i.e. defendeth, or avengeth, or delivereth, as this word is oft used, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm" title="For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.">Deu 32:36</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm" title="For you have maintained my right and my cause; you sat in the throne judging right.">Psalm 9:4</a> 10:18 26:1</span>, &c. <span class="ital">To judge</span> is properly to give sentence; which because it may be done either by absolving and acquitting from punishment, or by condemning and giving up to punishment, therefore it is sometimes used for the one and sometimes for the other, as the circumstances of the place determine it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With the wicked; </span> which though it may seem a bold supplement, yet is necessary, and easily fetched out of the next and following verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Every day; </span> even then, when his providence seems to favour them and they are most secure and confident. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>God judgeth the righteous,.... Not all that are thought to be righteous, or think themselves to be so, are such; nor is any man naturally righteous, or of himself, nor by virtue of his obedience to the law of works; but such only are righteous who are made so by the obedience of Christ; these God governs and protects, avenges their injuries and defends their persons; some render the words, "God is a righteous Judge" (f); he is so now in the administrations of his government of the universe, and he will be so hereafter in the general judgment of the world; <p>and God is angry with the wicked every day; wicked men are daily sinning, and God is always the same in his nature, and has the same aversion to sin continually; and though he is not always making men examples of his wrath, yet his wrath is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men; and there are frequent stances of it; and when he is silent he is still angry, and in his own time will stir up all his wrath, and rebuke in his hot displeasure. <p>(f) Vid.

The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;, cogn. &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, signifies originally to finish, complete, (root &#1490;&#1501;, &#1499;&#1501; ,&#1490;&#1501; t, cf. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; to be or to make full, to gather into a heap).

The poet would then have written: &#1488;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506; i.e., if I have retaliated upon him that hath done evil to me.

(Louis de Dieu, Ewald 345, a, and Hupfeld). Why cannot &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1509; in accordance with its primary signification expedire, exuere (according to which even the signification of rescuing, taken exactly, does not proceed from the idea of drawing out, but of making loose, exuere vinclis) signify here exuere  equals  spoliare, as it does in Aramaic? And how extremely appropriate it is as an allusion to the incident in the cave, when David did not rescue Saul, but, without indeed designing to take &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;, exuviae, cut off the hem of his garment!

This dactylic jussive form of Kal is followed by the regular jussives of Hiph. &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1490; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;. The rhythm is similar so that in the primary passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>, which also finds its echo in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-38.htm">Psalm 18:38</a>, - viz. iambic with anapaests inspersed. By its parallelism with &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; and &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; acquires the signification "my soul," as Saadia, Gecatilia and Aben-Ezra have rendered it - a signification which is secured to it by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-13.htm">Psalm 30:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-9.htm">Psalm 57:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/108-2.htm">Psalm 108:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>. Man's soul is his doxa, and this it is as being the copy of the divine doxa (Bibl. Psychol. S. 98, [tr. p. 119], and frequently). Moreover, "let him lay in the dust" is at least quite as favourable to this sense of &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; as to the sense of personal and official dignity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-4.htm">Psalm 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>). To lay down in the dust is equivalent to: to lay in the dust of death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, are the dead. According to the biblical conception the soul is capable of being killed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11</a>), and mortal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a>). It binds spirit and body together and this bond is cut asunder by death. David will submit willingly to death in case he has ever acted dishonourably.<p>Here the music is to strike up, in order to give intensity to the expression of this courageous confession. In the next strophe is affirmation of innocence rises to a challenging appeal to the judgment-seat of God and a prophetic certainty that that judgment is near at hand. </body></html>
