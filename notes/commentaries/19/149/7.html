They did not do it from personal revenge or earthly politics, but in obedience to God's command. And the honour intended for all the saints of God, consists in their triumphs over the enemies of their salvation. Christ never intended his gospel should be spread by fire and sword, or his righteousness by the wrath of man. But let the high praises of God be in our mouths, while we wield the sword of the word of God, with the shield of faith, in warfare with the world, the flesh, and the devil. The saints shall be more than conquerors over the enemies of their souls, through the blood of the Lamb and the word of his testimony. The completing of this will be in the judgement of the great day. Then shall the judgement be executed. Behold Jesus, and his gospel church, chiefly in her millennial state. He and his people rejoice in each other; by their prayers and efforts they work with him, while he goes forth in the chariots of salvation, conquering sinners by grace, or in chariots of vengeance, to destroy his enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/149.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To execute vengeance upon the heathen - To inflict punishment upon them as a recompence for their sins. The word pagan here means nations. The allusion is, doubtless, to those who had oppressed and injured the Hebrew people - perhaps referring to those who had destroyed the city and the temple at the time of the Babylonian captivity. They were now to receive the punishment due for the wrongs which they had done to the nation; a just recompence at the hand of God, and by the instrumentality of those whom they had wronged. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7-9</a>.<p>And punishments upon the people - The people of those lands.

This was literally accomplished by David upon the Philistines, Ammonites, Syrians, and other neighbouring nations and princes, which were bitter enemies to God’s people. And the same thing was done afterward in the Christian world, when God raised up Christian princes, who did by the help of the Christians, fighting with and under them, severely revenge the blood of the martyred Christians upon their cruel persecutors and tyrants in divers ages. It may also be understood of the spiritual plagues which Christ by the hand or ministry of his apostles and ministers did inflict upon the hearts and consciences of his incorrigible enemies, who by God’s word and ordinances were either tormented or hardened to their destruction.

Either upon the Gentile world, in the first times of the Gospel; when the apostles, going there with the twoedged sword of the word, vehemently inveighed against the idolatry of the Heathens, and exhorted them to turn from their idols to serve the living God; and divine power going along with their ministry, multitudes were turned from them; through the success of the Gospel, the oracles of the Heathen were struck dumb, their priests were despised, their idol temples were forsaken, and idols rejected; now were the judgment of the Heathen world, and the prince of it, cast out, and vengeance in this way taken upon it, or their disobedience to God revenged, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>. Or else upon the Papists, as will be in the latter times of the Gospel; who are sometimes called Heathens and Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-16.htm">Psalm 10:16</a>; on whom vengeance will be taken for all their idolatry, superstition, and bloodshed of the saints; and they will be smitten and slain by the twoedged sword, proceeding out of the mouth of Christ, and as in the hands of his servants, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>; <p>and punishments upon the people; or "reproofs" (p); sharp and piercing ones; such as the convictions the word of God will strike in the minds of men, and will be very distressing and afflicting to them; as the fire out of the mouths of the witnesses, which is their doctrine, will be to their enemies the Papists; and will torment and kill them, and be the savour of death unto death unto them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5</a>. <p>(p) "increpationes", V.

Such a new era has now dawned for the church of the saints, the Israel that has remained faithful to its God and the faith of its fathers. The Creator of Israel (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1493;, plural, with the plural suffix, like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>; according to Hupfeld and Hitzig, cf. Ew. 256, b, Ges. 93, 9, singular; but aj, ajich, aw, are always really plural suffixes) has shown that He is also Israel's Preserver and the King of Zion, that He cannot leave the children of Zion for any length of time under foreign dominion, and has heard the sighing of the exiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>). Therefore the church newly appropriated by its God and King is to celebrate Him, whose Name shines forth anew out of its history, with festive dance, timbrel, and cithern. For (as the occasion, hitherto only hinted at, is now expressly stated) Jahve takes a pleasure in His people; His wrath in comparison with His mercy is only like a swiftly passing moment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>.).
