They did not do it from personal revenge or earthly politics, but in obedience to God's command. And the honour intended for all the saints of God, consists in their triumphs over the enemies of their salvation. Christ never intended his gospel should be spread by fire and sword, or his righteousness by the wrath of man. But let the high praises of God be in our mouths, while we wield the sword of the word of God, with the shield of faith, in warfare with the world, the flesh, and the devil. The saints shall be more than conquerors over the enemies of their souls, through the blood of the Lamb and the word of his testimony. The completing of this will be in the judgement of the great day. Then shall the judgement be executed. Behold Jesus, and his gospel church, chiefly in her millennial state. He and his people rejoice in each other; by their prayers and efforts they work with him, while he goes forth in the chariots of salvation, conquering sinners by grace, or in chariots of vengeance, to destroy his enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/149.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To bind their kings with chains - To make them prisoners and captives. This is but carrying out the idea in the previous verses, of inflicting punishment upon them for the wrongs which they had done to the people of God. There is no evidence that this refers to a spiritual conquest, or to a spiritual subjection of those nations to the true religion. The whole idea is in accordance with what is so often expressed in the Psalms - that of inflicting just punishment on the wicked. See the General Introduction, Section 6.<p>And their nobles with fetters of iron - To make them prisoners. That is, to subdue them. Captives in war, even those of elevated rank, were often led in chains to grace the triumph of conquerors. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/149.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Which is thought to allude to what was done to the Canaanitish kings, in the times of Joshua; and to the princes of Midian by Gideon; and to Agag by Saul; and to the Ammonites, Syrians, and others, by David: but it refers either to the first times of the Gospel, and the influence of the sword of the Spirit over the hearts of men; and on some very great personages, as kings and nobles, brought to Christ and his churches, in chains of powerful and efficacious grace, declaring a ready and cheerful subjection to his Gospel and ordinances; such as Constantine, Theodosius, and others; and who were instruments in subduing, conquering, and destroying tyrannical and persecuting emperors and princes, as Maximilian, Licinius, and others; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>; and more instances of the power of the Gospel, and the influence of divine grace on such persons, there will be in the latter day; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>. It may also respect the use of the Gospel ministry, compared to a twoedged sword on the hearts of men in common; whereby Satan, the strong man armed, who keeps the palace as a king or prince, is dispossessed; and sin, which reigns like a king unto death, is dethroned, and grace is set up as a governing principle. But it may chiefly regard the destruction of antichristian kings and nobles, and their states, through the prevalence of the Gospel and the power of Christ, and the twoedged sword coming out of his mouth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/149.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To bind <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;</span><p>(f) Not only the people, but the kings who were their enemies should be destroyed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/149.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. The subjection and homage of the nations to Israel are repeatedly anticipated in the later chapters of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you, and they shall be yours: they shall come after you; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to you, they shall make supplication to you, saying, Surely God is in you; and there is none else, there is no God.">Isaiah 45:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you.">Isaiah 49:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-23.htm" title="And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.">Isaiah 49:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a> ff.).

Even royal captives were thus treated in the ancient world. Assyrian and Babylonian monarchs always represent their captives, even when kings, as fettered. Nebuchadnezzar "bound Zedekiah with fetters of brass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). Parthia, and later Persia, and even Rome, followed the same practice. And their nobles with fetters of iron. On the monuments, cap-fives below the rank of kings are not often seen "fettered." Their arms, however, are frequently tied together with a cord, and they are fastened one to another by a stout rope. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/149.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A period, in which the church is renewing its youth and drawing nearer to the form it is finally to assume, also of inward necessity puts forth new songs. Such a new era has now dawned for the church of the saints, the Israel that has remained faithful to its God and the faith of its fathers. The Creator of Israel (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1493;, plural, with the plural suffix, like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>; according to Hupfeld and Hitzig, cf. Ew. 256, b, Ges. 93, 9, singular; but aj, ajich, aw, are always really plural suffixes) has shown that He is also Israel's Preserver and the King of Zion, that He cannot leave the children of Zion for any length of time under foreign dominion, and has heard the sighing of the exiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>). Therefore the church newly appropriated by its God and King is to celebrate Him, whose Name shines forth anew out of its history, with festive dance, timbrel, and cithern. For (as the occasion, hitherto only hinted at, is now expressly stated) Jahve takes a pleasure in His people; His wrath in comparison with His mercy is only like a swiftly passing moment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>.). The futures that follow state that which is going on at the present time. &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; is, as frequently, a designation of the ecclesia pressa, which has hitherto, amidst patient endurance of suffering, waited for God's own act of redemption. He now adorns them with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, help against the victory over the hostile world; now the saints, hitherto enslaved and contemned, exult &#1489;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, in honour, or on account of the honour which vindicates them before the world and is anew bestowed upon them (&#1489;&#1468; of the reason, or, which is more probable in connection with the boldness of the expression, of the state and mood);<p>(Note: Such, too (with pomp, not "with an army"), is the meaning of &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; in 1 Macc. 10:60; 14:4, 5, vid., Grimm in loc.))<p>they shout for joy upon their beds, upon which they have hitherto poured forth their complaints over the present (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>), and ardently longed for a better future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>); for the bed is the place of soliloquy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-5.htm">Psalm 4:5</a>), and the tears shed there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>) are turned into shouts of joy in the case of Israel. </body></html>
