But the Authorised Version is probably right, since the analogy of such words as “provident,” “circumspect,” shows how the idea of caution and then wisdom arises from that of looking. The English idiom, “look to your ways,” illustrates the Hebrew here.<p><span class= "bld">O when wilt thou come unto me</span>?—This clause is so awkward, however translated, that some critics go the length of pronouncing it spurious. In the Old Testament, with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.">Exodus 20:24</a>, the coming of God to a person is associated with the idea of punishment or inquisition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm" title="You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.">Psalm 17:3</a>); and to see a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-9.htm" title="And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?">2Samuel 6:9</a> (“ How shall the ark of the Lord come to me?”) seems far-fetched. It is better, therefore, to take the verb as the third person feminine instead of second masculine, with “perfect way” as its subject. The only difficulty in the way of this rendering is the interrogative; but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-22.htm" title="Listen to your father that begat you, and despise not your mother when she is old.">Proverbs 23:22</a>, it becomes a simple adverb of time, we may treat it so here: “I will give heed to a guileless way when it comes to me,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>whenever a course of action arises, presenting an alternative of a <span class= "ital">right </span>and <span class= "ital">wrong, </span>or a <span class= "ital">better </span>and <span class= "ital">worse, </span>I will choose the <span class= "ital">better.</span><p><span class= "bld">I will walk within my house.</span>—This vow of an <span class= "ital">Eastern </span>monarch should be read with the thought of the palace of a caliph at Bagdad, or a sultan at Constantinople, before the mind. But it is a reflection of universal application, that piety should begin at home, and religion show itself in the household as much as at church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/101.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-2.htm" title="I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will you come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.">Psalm 101:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way — </span>I will manage my affairs with wisdom and integrity; which are the two chief qualifications requisite for all men, and peculiarly necessary in princes, whose example is wont to have great influence on the morals of their people, and who can with no dignity nor consistency punish the crimes of others, if they be guilty of the same crimes themselves. <span class="ital">O, when wilt thou come to me? —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And be with me to assist me to execute this my purpose. God is often said, in Scripture, to <span class="ital">come </span>to men when he fulfils a promise to them, confers a favour upon them, peculiarly assists them, or is, in an especial manner, present with them. David, having declared it to be his resolution to set his court and kingdom an example of true wisdom and unshaken integrity, shows, in these words, the sense he had of his need of a peculiar visitation of divine grace, to enable him to put his resolution in practice, and accordingly expresses the passionate desire which he had for it in these words. <span class="ital">I will walk within my house — </span>I will conduct myself in my family and court, as well as in my public administration of the affairs of my kingdom, <span class="ital">with a perfect heart — </span>Sincerely intending and desiring to please and glorify God, and to set before the members of my family, and all my subjects, an example worthy of their imitation. This clause adds weight to the former. He determines not only to walk in a perfect or right way, which a man might do for politic reasons, or with an evil design; but to do so with an upright, honest heart, which is most acceptable to God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/101.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>101:1-8 David's vow and profession of godliness. - In this psalm we have David declaring how he intended to regulate his household, and to govern his kingdom, that he might stop wickedness, and encourage godliness. It is also applicable to private families, and is the householder's psalm. It teaches all that have any power, whether more or less, to use it so as to be a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well. The chosen subject of the psalm is God's mercy and judgment. The Lord's providences concerning his people are commonly mixed; mercy and judgment. God has set the one over against the other, both to do good, like showers and sunshine. When, in his providence, he exercises us with the mixture of mercy and judgment, we must make suitable acknowledgments to him for both. Family mercies and family afflictions are both calls to family religion. Those who are in public stations are not thereby excused from care in governing their families; they are the more concerned to set a good example of ruling their own houses well. Whenever a man has a house of his own, let him seek to have God to dwell with him; and those may expect his presence, who walk with a perfect heart, in a perfect way. David resolves to practise no evil himself. He further resolves not to keep bad servants, nor to employ those about him that are wicked. He will not admit them into his family, lest they spread the infection of sin. A froward heart, one that delights to be cross and perverse, is not fit for society, the bond of which is Christian love. Nor will he countenance slanderers, those who take pleasure in wounding their neighbour's reputation. Also, God resists the proud, and false, deceitful people, who scruple not to tell lies, or commit frauds. Let every one be zealous and diligent to reform his own heart and ways, and to do this early; ever mindful of that future, most awful morning, when the King of righteousness shall cut off all wicked doers from the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/101.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will behave myself wisely - In the choice of principles to guide me; in my conduct in my family; in my official relations.

The idea is that God would come to visit his habitation, and inspect his conduct; and that whenever this should occur, however often it might be, or however unexpectedly he might come, he should "always" find these principles governing him in his family. A man should so live that "whenever" God comes into his dwelling, or when anyone comes, or however narrow and searching may be the inspection, these principles shal be found to regulate his conduct.<p>I will walk within my house - Before my family; in the principles which shall govern me there.<p>With a perfect heart - Always aiming to do exactly that which is right: in my general conduct; in the rules by which I live; in my treatment of all under my charge and in my employ.

Withal, he may intimate now he could not do as he desired, and that by the necessity of his affairs he was forced to make use of such men as he did not like, and to wink at those miscarriages which it was not now in his power to reform.

The first verse, without any parallelism and in so far monostichic, is like the signal for a blowing of the trumpets. Instead of "serve Jahve with gladness (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492;)," it is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-11.htm">Psalm 2:11</a>, "serve Jahve with fear (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;)." Fear and joy do not exclude one another. Fear becomes the exalted Lord, and the holy gravity of His requirements; joy becomes the gracious Lord, and His blessed service. The summons to manifest this joy in a religious, festive manner springs up out of an all-hopeful, world-embracing love, and this love is the spontaneous result of living faith in the promise that all tribes of the earth shall be blessed in the seed of Abraham, and in the prophecies in which this promise is unfolded. &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-4.htm">Psalm 4:4</a>) Theodoret well interprets &#x3b4;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. They are to know from facts of outward and inward experience that Jahve is God: He hath made us, and not we ourselves.

The Ker, on the other hand, reads &#1500;&#1493;,<p>(Note: According to the reckoning of the Masora, there are fifteen passages in the Old Testament in which &#1500;&#1488; is written and &#1500;&#1493; is read, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-21.htm">Leviticus 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-30.htm">Leviticus 25:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-18.htm">2 Samuel 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-10.htm">2 Kings 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a> cf. the note there, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-7.htm">Proverbs 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>.

Hengstenberg calls this Ker quite unsuitable and bad; and Hupfeld, on the other hand, calls the Chethb an "unspeakable insipidity." But in reality both readings accord with the context, and it is clear that they are both in harmony with Scripture. Many a one has drawn balsamic consolation from the words ipse fecit nos et non ipsi nos; e.g., Melancthon when disconsolately sorrowful over the body of his son in Dresden on the 12th July 1559. But in ipse fecit nos et ipsius nos sumus there is also a rich mine of comfort and of admonition, for the Creator of also the Owner, His heart clings to His creature, and the creature owes itself entirely to Him, without whom it would not have had a being, and would not continue in being. Since, however, the parallel passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>, favours &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; rather than &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;; since, further, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; ,reh is the easier reading, inasmuch as &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; leads one to expect that an antithesis will follow (Hitzig); and since the "His people and the sheep of His pasture" that follows is a more natural continuation of a preceding &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493; than that it should be attached as a predicative object to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; over a parenthetical &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;: the Ker decidedly maintains the preference. In connection with both readings, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; has a sense related to the history of redemption, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>. Israel is Jahve's work (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;), <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, not merely as a people, but as the people of God, who were kept in view even in the calling of Abram. </body></html>
