Dr. Chandler considers this last clause as an evident proof that David was now king over all Israel, and in possession of Jerusalem, styled by him <span class="ital">the city of the Lord, </span>because it was now the place where the Lord was peculiarly present, David having lodged the ark in the tabernacle prepared there for its reception. It is justly observed by the same judicious divine, that “this Psalm affords an admirable lesson for princes, to direct themselves in the administration of their affairs in public and private life. They should be the patrons of religion and virtue, and encourage them by their own example and practice. Those of their households, their servants, ministers, and particularly their favourites and friends, should be of unblameable characters, and, if possible, eminent for every thing that is excellent and praiseworthy. Subtle and fraudulent men, back-biters, and slanderers, and private informers against others, they should detest, and show the utmost marks of displeasure at them. They should maintain the honour of the laws, and impartially punish all transgressors against them; and, instead of indulging ease, and being engrossed and dissipated by pleasure and amusement, they should consecrate a just portion of their time to the public service, and promoting the real happiness of their people. Thus they will be indeed truly <span class="ital">patriot </span>kings, honoured of God and esteemed and beloved of men.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/101.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>101:1-8 David's vow and profession of godliness. - In this psalm we have David declaring how he intended to regulate his household, and to govern his kingdom, that he might stop wickedness, and encourage godliness. It is also applicable to private families, and is the householder's psalm. It teaches all that have any power, whether more or less, to use it so as to be a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well. The chosen subject of the psalm is God's mercy and judgment. The Lord's providences concerning his people are commonly mixed; mercy and judgment. God has set the one over against the other, both to do good, like showers and sunshine. When, in his providence, he exercises us with the mixture of mercy and judgment, we must make suitable acknowledgments to him for both. Family mercies and family afflictions are both calls to family religion. Those who are in public stations are not thereby excused from care in governing their families; they are the more concerned to set a good example of ruling their own houses well. Whenever a man has a house of his own, let him seek to have God to dwell with him; and those may expect his presence, who walk with a perfect heart, in a perfect way. David resolves to practise no evil himself. He further resolves not to keep bad servants, nor to employ those about him that are wicked. He will not admit them into his family, lest they spread the infection of sin. A froward heart, one that delights to be cross and perverse, is not fit for society, the bond of which is Christian love. Nor will he countenance slanderers, those who take pleasure in wounding their neighbour's reputation. Also, God resists the proud, and false, deceitful people, who scruple not to tell lies, or commit frauds. Let every one be zealous and diligent to reform his own heart and ways, and to do this early; ever mindful of that future, most awful morning, when the King of righteousness shall cut off all wicked doers from the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/101.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will early destroy ... - Hebrew, "In the mornings I will destroy." That is, It shall be my first business as I enter upon the day. Possibly, also, by the use of the plural here - "in the mornings" - there may be the idea that this would be his constant rule of conduct: he would do it every day; he would do it morning by morning. He would on no day - at no time - allow the wicked to be in his service. This rule would be unvarying. It would extend through his life. The word "destroy" here may refer not only to his conduct as a man, and as the head of a family, but to the act of a magistrate; and the idea may be, that the rule which he prescribed for himself in his own house was a rule which he would carry with him into public: that is, as the psalm was composed by David, that, as a king and sovereign, it should be his aim to carry those principles to the throne; that, in respect to the state, he would do what he purposed to do in his home-relations. The strict and stern regard for truth, sincerity, honesty, fidelity, which he would evince in the one case he would evince in the other; carrying to the high employments of public life, where there were so many temptations to a contrary course, the inflexible virtues which were needful for peace, for happiness, and for success in domestic life.<p>That I may cut off - By discountenancing them; by punishing them if they are guilty.<p>All wicked doers - All violators of law.<p>From the city of the Lord - From Jerusalem, the place where God dwelt, and which was sacred to his service.

Can there be any more appropriate motto for it than what is said of Jahve's government in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-4.htm">Psalm 99:4</a>? In respect of this passage of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1-9</a>, to which <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/100-1.htm">Psalm 100:1-5</a> is the finale, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/101-1.htm">Psalm 101:1-8</a> seems to be appended as an echo out of the heart of David. The appropriateness of the words &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512; (the position of the words is as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1-10</a>; 40; 109:1-110:7; 139) is corroborated by the form and contents. Probably the great historical work from which the chronicler has taken excerpts furnished the post-exilic collector with a further gleaning of Davidic songs, or at least songs that were ascribed to David. The Psalm before us belongs to the time during which the Ark was in the house of Obed-Edom, where David had left it behind through terror at the misfortune of Uzzah. David said at that time: "How shall the Ark of Jahve come to me (the unholy one)?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-8.htm">2 Samuel 6:8</a>. He did not venture to bring the Ark of the Fearful and Holy One within the range of his own house. In our Psalm, however, he gives utterance to his determination as king to give earnest heed to the sanctity of his walk, of his rule, and of his house; and this resolve he brings before Jahve as a vow, to whom, in regard to the rich blessing which the Ark of God diffuses around it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>.), he longingly sighs: "When wilt Thou come to me?!" This contemporaneous reference has been recognised by Hammond and Venema. From the fact that Jahve comes to David, Jerusalem becomes "the city of Jahve," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-8.htm">Psalm 101:8</a>; and to defend the holiness of this the city of His habitation in all faithfulness, and with all his might, is the thing to which David here pledges himself.<p>The contents of the first verse refer not merely to the Psalm that follows as an announcement of its theme, but to David's whole life: graciousness and right, the self-manifestations united ideally and, for the king who governs His people, typically in Jahve, shall be the subject of his song. Jahve, the primal source of graciousness and of right, it shall be, to whom he consecrates his poetic talent, as also his playing upon the harp. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; is condescension which flows from the principle of free love, and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; legality which binds itself impartially and uncapriciously to the rule (norm) of that which is right and good. They are two modes of conduct, mutually tempering each other, which God requires of every man (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a> : &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), and more especially of a king. Further, he has resolved to give heed, thoughtfully and with an endeavour to pursue it (&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-13.htm">Daniel 9:13</a>), unto the way of that which is perfect, i.e., blameless. What is further said might now be rendered as a relative clause: when Thou comest to me. But not until then?! Hitzig renders it differently: I will take up the lot of the just when it comes to me, i.e., as often as it is brought to my knowledge. But if this had been the meaning, &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; would have been said instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-16.htm">Exodus 18:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a> [11]); for, according to both its parts, the expression &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is an ethical notion, and is therefore not used in a different sense from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-6.htm">Psalm 101:6</a>. Moreover, the relative use of the interrogative &#1502;&#1514;&#1497; in Hebrew cannot be supported, with the exception, perhaps, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-35.htm">Proverbs 23:35</a>. Athanasius correctly interprets: &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, &#x3c9;&#787;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. It is a question of strong yearning: when wilt Thou come to me? is the time near at hand when Thou wilt erect Thy throne near to me? If his longing should be fulfilled, David is resolved to, and will then, behave himself as he further sets forth in the vows he makes. He pledges himself to walk within his house, i.e., his palace, in the innocence or simplicity of his heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-72.htm">Psalm 78:72</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a>), without allowing himself to be led away from this frame of mind which has become his through grace.
