When the heart is firm in faith and love, the tongue, being employed in grateful praises, is our glory. Every gift of the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls with this salvation, with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/108.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Through God we shall do ... - This also is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-12.htm">Psalm 60:12</a>, without change.<p>Thus the psalm, though made up of parts of two separate psalms, is complete and continuous in itself. There is no break or discrepancy in the current of thought, but the unity is as perfect as though it had been an original composition. It is to be remarked, also, that though in the original psalms the parts which are used here have a different connection, and are separately complete there, yet as employed here, they seem to be exactly suited to the new use which is made of the language; and though the original "reasons" for the use of the language do not appear here, yet there is a sufficient reason for that language apparent in the psalm as rearranged. To an Israelite, also, there might be a new interest in the use of the language in the fact that words with which he was familiar, as employed for other purposes, "could" be thus combined, and made applicable to a new occasion in the national history. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/108.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 108<p>Ps 108:1-13. This Psalm is composed of Ps 108:1-5 of Ps 57:7-11; and Ps 108:6-12 of Ps 60:5-12. The varieties are verbal and trivial, except that in Ps 108:9, "over Philistia will I triumph," differs from Ps 60:8, the interpretation of which it confirms. Its altogether triumphant tone may intimate that it was prepared by David, omitting the plaintive portions of the other Psalms, as commemorative of God's favor in the victories of His people.   <a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/108.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>13 Through God we shall do valiantly, for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-13.htm">Psalm 108:13</a><p>God's help shall inspire us to help ourselves. Faith is neither a coward nor a sluggard she knows that God is with her, and therefore she does valiantly; she knows that he will tread down her enemies, and therefore she arises to tread them down in his name. Where praise and prayer have preceded the battle, we may expect to see heroic deeds and decisive victories. "Through God" is our secret support; from that source we draw all our courage, wisdom, and strength. "We shall do valiantly." This is the public outflow from that secret source our inward and spiritual faith proves itself by outward and valorous deeds. "He shall tread down our enemies." They shall fall before him, and as they lie prostrate he shall march over them, and all the hosts of his people with him. This is a prophecy. It was fulfilled to David, but it remains true to the Son of David and all who are on his side. The church shall yet arouse herself to praise her God with all her heart, and then with songs and hosannas she will advance to the great battle; her foes shall be overthrown and utterly crushed by the power of her God, and the Lord's glory shall be above all the earth. Send it in our time, we beseech thee, O Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/108.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/108.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?....

The clause expressing the purpose with &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, as in its original, has the following &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; for its principal clause upon which it depends. Instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which one might have expected, the expression used here is &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; without any interchange of the mode of writing and of reading it; many printed copies have &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493; here also; Baer, following Norzi, correctly has &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;. Instead of &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, we here read &#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, which is less soaring. And instead of Cry aloud concerning me, O Philistia do I shout for joy (the triumphant cry of the victor); in accordance with which Hupfeld wishes to take &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; in the former as infinitive: "over (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;) Philistia is my shouting for joy" (&#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; instead of &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497;, since the infinitive does not admit of this pausal form of the imperative). For &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512; we have here the more usual form of expression &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-12.htm">Psalm 108:12</a> is weakened by the omission of the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;). </body></html>
