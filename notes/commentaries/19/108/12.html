When the heart is firm in faith and love, the tongue, being employed in grateful praises, is our glory. Every gift of the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls with this salvation, with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/108.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give us help from trouble ... - This is copied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-11.htm">Psalm 60:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/108.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 108<p>Ps 108:1-13. This Psalm is composed of Ps 108:1-5 of Ps 57:7-11; and Ps 108:6-12 of Ps 60:5-12. The varieties are verbal and trivial, except that in Ps 108:9, "over Philistia will I triumph," differs from Ps 60:8, the interpretation of which it confirms. Its altogether triumphant tone may intimate that it was prepared by David, omitting the plaintive portions of the other Psalms, as commemorative of God's favor in the victories of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/108.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/108.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?....

The clause expressing the purpose with &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, as in its original, has the following &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; for its principal clause upon which it depends. Instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which one might have expected, the expression used here is &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; without any interchange of the mode of writing and of reading it; many printed copies have &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493; here also; Baer, following Norzi, correctly has &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;. Instead of &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, we here read &#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, which is less soaring. And instead of Cry aloud concerning me, O Philistia do I shout for joy (the triumphant cry of the victor); in accordance with which Hupfeld wishes to take &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; in the former as infinitive: "over (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;) Philistia is my shouting for joy" (&#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; instead of &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497;, since the infinitive does not admit of this pausal form of the imperative). For &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512; we have here the more usual form of expression &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-12.htm">Psalm 108:12</a> is weakened by the omission of the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;). </body></html>
