When the heart is firm in faith and love, the tongue, being employed in grateful praises, is our glory. Every gift of the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls with this salvation, with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/108.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God hath spoken ... - This is taken, without change, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a>.

This Psalm is composed of Ps 108:1-5 of Ps 57:7-11; and Ps 108:6-12 of Ps 60:5-12. The varieties are verbal and trivial, except that in Ps 108:9, "over Philistia will I triumph," differs from Ps 60:8, the interpretation of which it confirms. Its altogether triumphant tone may intimate that it was prepared by David, omitting the plaintive portions of the other Psalms, as commemorative of God's favor in the victories of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/108.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/108.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That thy beloved may be delivered,....

God’s ‘holiness’ includes His whole essential nature in its moral aspect, and that nature makes it impossible for Him to break His promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm" title="God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm" title="In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;">Titus 1:2</a>). It is equivalent to ‘Himself’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-8.htm" title="The Lord GOD has sworn by himself, said the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.">Amos 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm" title="For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,">Hebrews 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-17.htm" title="Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:...">Hebrews 6:17-18</a>). <span class="ital">In his sanctuary</span> (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-2.htm" title="To see your power and your glory, so as I have seen you in the sanctuary.">Psalm 63:2</a>) is a possible but less probable rendering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will rejoice</span>] Better as R.V., I will exult.

I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1</a> ff. God is represented as a victorious warrior, conquering the land, and portioning it out to His people. He makes Ephraim the chief defence of His kingdom, and Judah the seat of government, while surrounding nations are treated as vassals. It is possible that the original Psalmist was quoting some actual oracle, but more probably he was reproducing freely in poetical form the drift of the great promise to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/7-9.htm" title="And I was with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies out of your sight, and have made you a great name, like to the name of the great men that are in the earth....">2 Samuel 7:9-10</a>). Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm" title="Then you spoke in vision to your holy one, and said, I have laid help on one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.">Psalm 89:19</a>. Though the words in their full meaning could no longer be applicable to the community of the Restoration, they would serve as an assurance of God’s purpose to establish them once more securely in His own land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Shechem … the valley of Succoth</span>] Shechem, as a central place of importance, represents the territory west of the Jordan; Succoth, ‘in the vale’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm" title="And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.">Joshua 13:27</a>), somewhere to the south of the Jabbok, between Peniel and the Jordan, represents the territory east of the Jordan. These two places in particular may be named, because of their connexion with the history of Jacob, who halted first at Succoth and then at Shechem, when he returned to Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/33-17.htm" title="And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth....">Genesis 33:17-18</a>).
