When the heart is firm in faith and love, the tongue, being employed in grateful praises, is our glory. Every gift of the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls with this salvation, with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/108.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Awake, psaltery and harp ... - This is copied without change from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-8.htm">Psalm 57:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/108.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 108<p>Ps 108:1-13. This Psalm is composed of Ps 108:1-5 of Ps 57:7-11; and Ps 108:6-12 of Ps 60:5-12. The varieties are verbal and trivial, except that in Ps 108:9, "over Philistia will I triumph," differs from Ps 60:8, the interpretation of which it confirms. Its altogether triumphant tone may intimate that it was prepared by David, omitting the plaintive portions of the other Psalms, as commemorative of God's favor in the victories of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/108.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/108.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise,....

Hitzig is of opinion that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39</a> goes back into the time when things were different with those who, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-36.htm">Psalm 107:36-38</a>, had thriven. The modus consecutivus is sometimes used thus retrospectively (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-5.htm">Isaiah 37:5</a>); here, however, the symmetry of the continuation from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-36.htm">Psalm 107:36-38</a>, and the change which is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39</a> in comparison with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-38.htm">Psalm 107:38</a>, require an actual consecution in that which is narrated. They became few and came down, were reduced (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1495;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-19.htm">Proverbs 14:19</a> : to come to ruin, or to be overthrown), a coarctatione malitiae et maeroris. &#1506;&#1510;&#1512; is the restraint of despotic rule, &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; the evil they had to suffer under such restraint, and &#1512;&#1490;&#1493;&#1503; sorrow, which consumed their life. &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1512; has Tarcha and &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; Munach (instead of Mercha and Mugrash, vid., Accentuationssystem, xviii. 2). There is no reason for departing from this interpunction and rendering: "through tyranny, evil, and sorrow." What is stiff and awkward in the progress of the description arises from the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a> is borrowed from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-21.htm">Job 12:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-24.htm">Job 12:24</a>, and that the poet is not willing to make any change in these sublime words. The version shows how we think the relation of the clauses is to be apprehended. Whilst He pours out His wrath upon tyrants in the contempt of men that comes upon them, and makes them fugitives who lose themselves in the terrible waste, He raises the needy and those hitherto despised and ill-treated on high out of the depth of their affliction, and makes families like a flock, i.e., makes their families so increase, that they come to have the appearance of a merrily gamboling and numerous flock. Just as this figure points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-11.htm">Job 21:11</a>, so <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-42.htm">Psalm 107:42</a> is made up out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-19.htm">Job 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-16.htm">Job 5:16</a>. The sight of this act of recognition on the part of God of those who have been wrongfully oppressed gives joy to the upright, and all roguery (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-16.htm">Psalm 92:16</a>) has its mouth closed, i.e., its boastful insolence is once for all put to silence. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-43.htm">Psalm 107:43</a> the poet makes the strains of his Psalm die away after the example of Hosea, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-10.htm">Hosea 14:10</a> [9], in the nota bene expressed after the manner of a question: Who is wise - he will or let him keep this, i.e., bear it well in mind. The transition to the justice together with a change of number is rendered natural by the fact that &#1502;&#1497; &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, as in Hos. loc. cit. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-6.htm">Esther 5:6</a>, and without Waw apod. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-3.htm">Judges 7:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-16.htm">Proverbs 9:16</a>), is equivalent to quisquis sapeins est. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; &#1492; (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;) are the manifestations of mercy or loving-kindness in which God's ever-enduring mercy unfolds itself in history. He who is wise has a good memory for and a clear understanding of this. </body></html>
