When the heart is firm in faith and love, the tongue, being employed in grateful praises, is our glory. Every gift of the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls with this salvation, with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/108.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moab ... - This is fallen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>. The only change is in the close of the verse. Instead of "Plilistia, triumph thou because of me" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>, it is here, "Over Philistia will I triumph." Why the change was made is unknown. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/108.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 108<p>Ps 108:1-13. This Psalm is composed of Ps 108:1-5 of Ps 57:7-11; and Ps 108:6-12 of Ps 60:5-12. The varieties are verbal and trivial, except that in Ps 108:9, "over Philistia will I triumph," differs from Ps 60:8, the interpretation of which it confirms. Its altogether triumphant tone may intimate that it was prepared by David, omitting the plaintive portions of the other Psalms, as commemorative of God's favor in the victories of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/108.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/108.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Over Philistia will I triumph,....

The neighbouring nations are reduced to servitude. In striking contrast to the honour assigned to Ephraim and Judah is the disgrace of Moab and Edom. Moab, notorious for its pride (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-6.htm" title="We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.">Isaiah 16:6</a>), is compared to the vessel which is brought to the victorious warrior to wash his feet in when he returns from battle. The old enemy of God and His people is degraded to do menial service: in other words, it becomes a subject and a vassal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In close connexion with this metaphor the next line may be rendered, Unto Edom will I cast my shoe. Edom is like the slave to whom the warrior flings his sandals to carry or to clean. Haughty and defiant Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/obadiah/1-3.htm" title="The pride of your heart has deceived you, you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that said in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?...">Obadiah 1:3-4</a>) must perform the duty of the lowest slave (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>). The R.V. renders, Upon Edom will I cast my shoe. This would mean, ‘I will take possession of Edom,’ in allusion to an oriental custom of taking possession of land by casting the shoe upon it; but the first explanation agrees best with the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">over Philistia will I triumph</span>] Or, will I shout in triumph. This reading gives a good and simple sense, and may possibly be the original reading. For the various explanations of the difficult text in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm" title="Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph you because of me.">Psalm 60:8</a>, <span class="ital">shout thou because of me</span>, see note there. The LXX has the same rendering in both places, <span class="greekheb">ἐμοὶ</span> (<span class="greekheb">οἰ</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἀλλόφυλοι ὑπετάγησαν</span>, ‘unto me the aliens are subjected.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/108.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I east out my shoe.</span> Identical with the first two clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>. Over Philistia will I triumph. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a> the expression used is different. There we have, "Philistia, triumph thou over me," or, "because of me." Apparently the compiler has not understood David's irony, and has therefore changed the form of the verb. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/108.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This first half is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-8.htm">Psalm 57:8-12</a>.
