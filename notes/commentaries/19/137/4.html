Nehemiah’s answer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/2-2.htm" title="Why the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,">Nehemiah 2:2-3</a>) offers a direct illustration.<p>Of Jerusalem’s choir in Babylon it might truly be said:<p>“Like strangers’ voices here they sound,<p>In lands where not a memory strays.<p>Nor landmark breathes of other days,<p>But all is new unhallowed ground.”<p>TENNYSON: <span class= "ital">In Mcmoriam.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/137.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-4.htm" title="How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?">Psalm 137:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">How shall we sing the Lord’s song — </span>Those sacred songs which are appropriated to the worship of the true God in his temple, and are appointed by him to be sung only to his honour and in his service; <span class="ital">in a strange land — </span>When we are banished from our own temple and country, and among those who are strangers and enemies to our God and his worship? How can you imagine that miserable slaves should be disposed to sing songs of joy? Or that we can frame our minds in the land where we are exiles, to sing those songs which recount the mercies of God unto us in our once flourishing country. How, indeed, says Dr. Horne, “could they tune their voices to festive and eucharistic strains, when God, by punishing them for their sins, called to mourning and weeping? But then Israel in Babylon foresaw a day of redemption; and so doth the church in the world; a day when she shall triumph, and her enemies shall lick the dust. No circumstances, therefore, should make us forget her and the promises concerning her.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/137.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>137:1-4 Their enemies had carried the Jews captive from their own land. To complete their woes, they insulted over them; they required of them mirth and a song. This was very barbarous; also profane, for no songs would serve but the songs of Zion. Scoffers are not to be compiled with. They do not say, How shall we sing, when we are so much in sorrow? but, It is the Lord's song, therefore we dare not sing it among idolaters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/137.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How shall we sing the Lord's song - The song designed to celebrate his praise; that is, appropriate to the worship of Yahweh.<p>In a strange land - Far from our home; far from the temple; exiles; captives: how can we find spirit in such circumstances to sing? How can we do that which would be indicative of what we do not feel, and cannot feel - joy and happiness! The idea is not that those psalms or songs would be profaned by being sung there, or that there would be anything improper in itself in singing them, but that it would be misplaced and incongruous to sing them in their circumstances. It would be doing violence to their own feelings; their feelings would not allow them to do it. There are states of mind when the language of joy is appropriate and natural; there are states where the heart is so sad that it cannot sing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/137.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

This is the answer returned by the Jews to the above request or demand; it may be, particularly, by the Levites, whose business it was to sing these songs: so the Targum, <p>"immediately the Levites said, how shall we sing the hymns of the Lord in a strange land?'' <p>This they said, not merely on account of their unsuitable circumstances, being in distress and affliction, and so not disposed for such work; nor as if unlawful to them, being forbidden: for, though sacrifices were not to be offered but at Jerusalem, yet songs of praise might be sung elsewhere, on proper occasions, as David did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a>; but as wondering at their insolence, and complaining of their cruelty and inhumanity, thus to insult them and jeer at them: or rather, because it was "the Lord's song" they required, and so sacred, and not to be sung in any place, or at any time, and in any company; which would be but casting pearls before swine, and giving that which was holy to dogs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>; or it may be they required this to be done in one of their temples, and to their idols, just as these songs were sung in the temple at Jerusalem, and to the honour of Jehovah; and therefore they refused to do it: for it may be rendered, or however interpreted, "in the land of a strange god" (c); as it is by Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech: they required them to sing with mirth and joy, which they could not do in their present case; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>. <p>(c)   "in terra peregina, sc.

The exiles indignantly repudiate the idea of doing what would be treason to the memories of Zion. The protest is dramatically expressed in the words which they would have used at the time.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/137.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?</span> The "songs of Zion" are Jehovah's songs, used in his worship, suited only for religious occasions. It would be desecration to sing them "in a strange land," among strange people, not to call forth devotional sentiment, but to gratify curiosity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/136.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Up to this point it is God the absolute in general, the Creator of all things, to the celebration of whose praise they are summoned; and from this point onwards the God of the history of salvation. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-13.htm">Psalm 136:13</a> &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512; (instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-11.htm">Nehemiah 9:11</a>) of the dividing of the Red Sea is peculiar; &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>, side by side with &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;) are the pieces or parts of a thing that is cut up into pieces. &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; is a favourite word taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>. With reference to the name of the Egyptian ruler Pharaoh (Herodotus also, ii. 111, calls the Pharaoh of the Exodus the son of Sesostris-Rameses Miumun, not &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, as he is properly called, but absolutely &#x3a6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;), vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-22.htm">Psalm 73:22</a>.

The words are taken over, as are the six lines of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/136-17.htm">Psalm 136:17-22</a> in the main, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>, with only a slight alteration in the expression. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-23.htm">Psalm 136:23</a> the continued influence of the construction &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500; is at an end. The connection by means of &#1513;&#1473; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-8.htm">Psalm 135:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10</a>) therefore has reference to the preceding "for His goodness endureth for ever."

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-23.htm">Psalm 136:23</a> the praise changes suddenly to that which has been experienced very recently.
