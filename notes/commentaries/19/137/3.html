The expression is generally regarded as pleonastic, but may be explained as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm" title="They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.">Psalm 105:27</a>, where see Note. Perhaps “some lyric thing” would express the original. No doubt it is a Levite who is requested to sing.<p><span class= "bld">They that wasted us.</span>—A peculiar Hebrew word which the LXX. and Vulg. take as synonymous with the verb in the first clause. The modern explanation, “they that make us howl,” is far preferable. Those whose oppression had raised the wild Oriental scream of lamentation, now asked for mirth.<p><span class= "bld">Songs of Zion</span>—or, as in the next verse, <span class= "ital">songs of Jehovah, </span>were of course the liturgical hymns. Nothing is more characteristic than this of the Hebrew feeling. The captors asked for a national song, as the Philistines asked for sport from Samson, to amuse them. The Hebrew can think only of one kind of song, that to which the genius of the race was dedicated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/137.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm" title="For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.">Psalm 137:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">There they that carried us away — </span>Our new masters, who had made us their slaves, and carried us captives out of our own land; <span class="ital">required of us a song — </span><span class="greekheb">דברי שׁיר</span>, <span class="ital">the words of a song: </span>in the LXX., <span class="greekheb">λογους ωδων</span>, <span class="ital">words of songs. </span>They required us to entertain them with our music and singing. <span class="ital">And they that wasted us — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ותוללינו</span>, <span class="ital">contumulatores nostri, they that laid us on heaps, </span>namely, that laid Jerusalem and the temple in ruins, <span class="ital">required of us mirth, </span><span class="greekheb">שׁמחה</span>, <span class="ital">joy, </span>or <span class="ital">gladness; saying, Sing us of the songs </span>(so it is in the Hebrew) <span class="ital">of Zion — </span>Sing us some of those songs which were wont to be sung in the temple on occasions of public joy. This they required, probably partly out of curiosity, and partly by way of scoffing and insult over them and their temple and worship, not without “a tacit reflection on their God, who could not protect his favoured people against their enemies.

To complete their woes, they insulted over them; they required of them mirth and a song. This was very barbarous; also profane, for no songs would serve but the songs of Zion. Scoffers are not to be compiled with. They do not say, How shall we sing, when we are so much in sorrow? but, It is the Lord's song, therefore we dare not sing it among idolaters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/137.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For there they that carried us away captive - The Babylonians.<p>Required of us a song - Asked of us a song. The word does not express the idea of compulsion or force. Margin, as in Hebrew, words of a song. Perhaps the idea is that they did not merely ask music, but they wished to hear the words - the songs themselves - in which they were accustomed to praise God. This may have been a taunt, and the request may have been in derision; or it may have been seriously, and with no desire to reproach them, or to add to their sorrows. We are not to impute bad motives to others where there is no evidence that there are any, and where the supposition of good motives will answer just as well; and the expression here may have been a kind and natural wish to hear the songs of these foreigners - songs of which they might have heard much by report; perhaps songs which they had overheard them singing when they were in a less desponding state of mind, and when they sought to comfort themselves by these ancient national melodies. As the only reason assigned for not complying with this request was that they could not "sing the Lord's song in a strange land" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a>, we are rather led to infer that there was no bad motive - no disposition to taunt and ridicule them by the request that was made.<p>And they that wasted us - Margin, laid us on heaps. The Hebrew word means a tormentor; properly, one who extorts lamentation from others, or who causes them to howl - to wit, under oppression or wrong. The Septuagint and Latin Vulgate render it, "They who led us away." The general idea is, those under whom they were then suffering; or, who had caused these trials to come upon them.<p>Required of us mirth - literally, "Our tormentors, joy." The Hebrew word means joy; and the sense is, that they asked them to give the usual indications of joy and happiness - to wit, a song. The language means, "Cheer up; be happy; give us one of the beautiful songs which you were accustomed to sing in your own land." It may, indeed, have been in derision; but there is no proof that it was.<p>Saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion - The songs - the sacred hymns - which you were accustomed to sing in worship in your own land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/137.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

Or, "words of a song" (z). To repeat the words of one of the songs of Zion, as it is afterwards expressed: this the Babylonians did, as the Targum; who were they that carried the Jews into captivity; and this is given as a reason why they hung their harps on willows, and were so sorrowful, because such a request as this was made; <p>and they that wasted us required of us mirth: the Chaldeans, who plundered them of their substance, and reduced their city and temple to heaps of rubbish, as the word (a) used signifies; or who heaped reproaches upon them, as Jarchi: these insisted not only on having the words of a song repeated to them, but that they should be set to some tune and sung in a manner expressing mirth, or would provoke unto it: or "our lamentations", according to Kimchi; that is, the authors of them (b), so barbarous were they; <p>saying, sing us one of the songs of Zion; which used to be sung in Zion in the temple, called the songs of the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-3.htm">Amos 8:3</a>; this demand they made either out of curiosity, that they might know something of the temple songs and music they had heard of; or rather as jeering at and insulting the poor Jews in their miserable and melancholy circumstances; as if they had said, now sing your songs if you can: or in order to make themselves sport and diversion with them, as the Philistines with Samson. The spiritual songs of Zion are the songs of electing, redeeming, calling, pardoning, and justifying grace; which natural men neither understand, nor can learn, but scoff at and despise. <p>(z)  "verba cantici", Pagninus, Montanus, Musculus, Piscator, Gejerus, Michaelis; "verba earminis", Cocceius.

As these songs are called in the next verse <span class="ital">Jehovah’s songs</span>, it is clear that it is not secular songs that are meant, but the sacred hymns of the Temple worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-27.htm" title="And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.">2 Chronicles 29:27</a>). To sing these for the amusement of their conquerors would have been the grossest profanation of all that they held most dear; an act comparable to Belshazzar’s use of the consecrated vessels at his feast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-2.htm" title="Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.">Daniel 5:2</a>).

The oppressors break into the retired gathering of their captives, and "require of them a song" - demand roughly and rudely to be entertained with the foreign music, which is perhaps sweeter than their own, or at any rate more of a novelty. <span class="cmt_word">And they that wasted us required us mirth</span>.  Not only was "a song" wanted but a joyous song - one that would wake feelings of mirth and gladness in those who heard it. Saying, <span class="cmt_word">sing us one of the songs of Zion</span>; literally, <span class="accented">sing us frown a song of Zion</span>. The captives had, no doubt, spoken of the joyous strains which they had been wont to pour forth in their own city upon festive occasions.
