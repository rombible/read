Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore.

Having boasted of his own actions during the space of two verses (vers. 37, 38), David falls back upon his habitual acknowledgments, that all which he has done has been done wholly through the strength of the Divine arm, which has upheld him, sustained him, and given him the victory. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me;</span> rather, <span class="accented">thou hast bowed down mine adversaries under me</span> (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:32-35) The grateful description of the tokens of favour he has experienced takes a new flight, and is continued in the second half of the Psalm in a more varied and less artificial mixture of the strophes. What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a> of the way and word of Jahve and of Jahve Himself, is confirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-32.htm">Psalm 18:32</a> by the fact that He alone is &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, a divine being to be reverenced, and He alone is &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, a rock, i.e., a ground of confidence that cannot be shaken. What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a> consequently can be said only of Him. &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; and &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; alternate; the former (with a negative intensive &#1502;&#1503;) signifies "without reference to" and then absolutely "without" or besides, and the latter (with &#305;&#770; as a connecting vowel, which elsewhere has also the function of a suffix), from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;), "exception." The verses immediately following are attached descriptively to &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, our God (i.e., the God of Israel), the God, who girded me with strength; and accordingly (fut. consec.) made my way &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "perfect," i.e., absolutely smooth, free from stumblings and errors, leading straight forward to a divine goal. The idea is no other than that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-3.htm">Job 22:3</a>, except that the freedom from error here is intended to be understood in accordance with its reference to the way of a man, of a king, and of a warrior; cf. moreover, the other text. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; signifies, like Arab. swwa&#770;, to make equal (aequare), to arrange, to set right; the dependent passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a> has, instead of this verb, the more uncoloured &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. The hind, &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, is the perfection of swiftness (cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) and also of gracefulness among animals. "Like the hinds" is equivalent to like hinds' feet; the Hebrew style leaves it to the reader to infer the appropriate point of comparison from the figure. It is not swiftness in flight (De Wette), but in attack and pursuit that is meant, - the latter being a prominent characteristic of warriors, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>. David does not call the high places of the enemy, which he has made his own by conquest "my high places," but those heights of the Holy Land which belong to him as king of Israel: upon these Jahve preserves him a firm position, so that from them he may rule the land far and wide, and hold them victoriously (cf. passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-14.htm">Isaiah 58:14</a>). The verb &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;, which has a double accusative in other instances, is here combined with &#1500; of the subject taught, as the aim of the teaching. The verb &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; (to press down  equals  to bend a bow) precedes the subject "my arms" in the singular; this inequality is admissible even when the subject stands first (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>). &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; a bow of brazen  equals  of brass, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>. It is also the manner of heroes in Homer and in the Ram-jana to press down and bend with their hand a brazen bow, one end of which rests on the ground. </body></html>
