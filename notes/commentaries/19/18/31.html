Freely formed Hithpaels are used with these attributive words to give expression to the corresponding self-manifestation: &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501; (Ges. 54, 2, b), &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, and &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500; (to show one's self &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500; or &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;). The fervent love of the godly man God requites with confiding love, the entire submission of the upright with a full measure of grace, the endeavour after purity by an unbeclouded charity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-1.htm">Psalm 73:1</a>), moral perverseness by paradoxical judgments, giving the perverse over to his perverseness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>) and leading him by strange ways to final condemnation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23</a>.). The truth, which is here enunciated, is not that the conception which man forms of God is the reflected image of his own mind and heart, but that God's conduct to man is the reflection of the relation in which man has placed himself to God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>. This universal truth is illustrated and substantiated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-28.htm">Psalm 18:28</a>. The people who are bowed down by affliction experience God's condescension, to their salvation; and their haughty oppressors, god's exaltation, to their humiliation. Lofty, proud eyes are among the seven things that Jahve hateth, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a>. The judgment of God compels them to humble themselves with shame, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>. </body></html>
