Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They prevented me - They anticipated me, or went before me.

If we compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>, it is natural to regard &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; as a transposition of &#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; (a chariot, Ew. 153, a). But assuming a relationship between the biblical Cherub and (according to Ctesias) the Indo-Persian griffin, the word (from the Zend grab, garew, garefsh, to seize) signifies a creature seizing and holding irrecoverably fast whatever it seizes upon; perhaps in Semitic language the strong creature, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;  equals  Arab. krb, torquere, constringere, whence mukrab, tight, strong). It is a passive form like &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, &#1497;&#1505;&#1491;, &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;. The cherubim are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> as the guards of Paradise (this alone is enough to refute the interpretation recently revived in the Evang. Kirchen-Zeit., 1866, No. 46, that they are a symbol of the unity of the living One, &#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; "like a multitude!"), and elsewhere, as it were, as the living mighty rampart and vehicle of the approach of the inaccessible majesty of God; and they are not merely in general the medium of God's personal presence in the world, but more especially of the present of God as turning the fiery side of His doxa towards the world. As in the Prometheus of Aeschylus, Oceanus comes flying &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, so in the present passage Jahve rides upon the cherub, of which the heathenish griffin is a distortion; or, if by a comparison of passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>, we understand David according to Ezekiel, He rides upon the cherub as upon His living throne-chariot (&#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;). The throne floats upon the cherubim, and this cherub-throne flies upon the wings of the wind; or, as we can also say: the cherub is the celestial spirit working in this vehicle formed of the spirit-like elements. The Manager of the chariot is Himself hidden behind the thick thunder-clouds. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; is an aorist without the consecutive &#1493; (cf. &#1497;&#1498; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>). &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; is the accusative of the object to it; and the accusative of the predicate is doubled: His covering, His pavilion round about Him. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-29.htm">Job 36:29</a> also the thunder-clouds are called God's &#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a> they are &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;, concealing Him on all sides and announcing only His presence when He is wroth. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a> the accusative of the object, &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, is expanded into "darkness of waters," i.e., swelling with waters<p>(Note: Rab Dimi, B. Taanth 10a, for the elucidation of the passage quotes a Palestine proverb: &#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; &#1494;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1498; &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; &#1505;&#1490;&#1497;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; i.e., if the clouds are transparent they will yield but little water, if they are dark they will yield a quantity.)<p>and billows of thick vapour, thick, and therefore dark, masses (&#1506;&#1489; in its primary meaning of denseness, or a thicket, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>) of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, which is here a poetical name for fleecy clouds. The dispersion and discharge, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a>, proceeded from &#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468; &#1490;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;. Such is the expression for the doxa of God as being a mirroring forth of His nature, as it were, over against Him, as being therefore His brightness, or the reflection of His glory. The doxa is fire and light. On this occasion the forces of wrath issue from it, and therefore it is the fiery forces: heavy and destructive hail (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>) and fiery glowing coals, i.e., flashing and kindling lightning. The object &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; stands first, because the idea of clouds, behind which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>, the doxa in concealed, is prominently connected with the doxa. It might be rendered: before His brightness His clouds turn into hail..., a rendering which would be more in accordance with the structure of the stichs, and is possible according to Ges. 138, rem. 2. Nevertheless, in connection with the combination of &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; with clouds, the idea of breaking through (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-44.htm">Lamentations 3:44</a>) is very natural. If &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; is removed, then &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; signifies "thence came forth hail..." But the mention of the clouds as the medium, is both natural and appropriate. </body></html>
