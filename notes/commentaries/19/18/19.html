Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He brought me forth also into a large place - Instead of being hemmed in by enemies, and straitened in my troubles, so that I seemed to have no room to move, he brought me into a place where I had ample room, and where I could act freely.

He begins by summing up all in a word, "God <span class="accented">delighted</span> in him."

Thunder is the rumble of God, and as it were the hollow murmur of His mouth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-2.htm">Job 37:2</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, the Most High, is the name of God as the inapproachable Judge, who governs all things. The third line of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14</a> is erroneously repeated from the preceding strophe. It cannot be supported on grammatical grounds by <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>, since &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, edere vocem, has a different meaning from the &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1511;&#1500;&#1514;, dare tonitrua, of that passage. The symmetry of the strophe structure is also against it; and it is wanting both in 2 Sam. nd in the lxx. &#1512;&#1489;, which, as the opposite of &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a>, means adverbially "in abundance," is the parallel to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;. It is generally taken, after the analogy of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-23.htm">Genesis 49:23</a>, in the sense of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-6.htm">Psalm 144:6</a> : &#1512;&#1489; in pause  equals  &#1512;&#1489; (the o&#772; passing over into the broader  like &#1506;&#1494; instead of &#1506;&#1494; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>)  equals  &#1512;&#1489;&#1489;, cognate with &#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, &#1512;&#1502;&#1492;; but the forms &#1505;&#1489;, &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, here, and in every other instance, have but a very questionable existence, as e.g., &#1512;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>, is more probably an adjective than the third person praet. (cf. Bttcher, Neue Aehrenlese No. 635, 1066). The suffixes e&#772;m do not refer to the arrows, i.e., lightnings, but to David's foes. &#1492;&#1502;&#1501; means both to put in commotion and to destroy by confounding, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>. In addition to the thunder, the voice of Jahve, comes the stormwind, which is the snorting of the breath of His nostrils. This makes the channels of the waters visible and lays bare the foundations of the earth. &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511; (collateral form to &#1488;&#1508;&#1511;) is the bed of the river and then the river or brook itself, a continendo aquas (Ges.), and exactly like the Arabic mes&#305;&#770;k, mesa&#770;k, mesek (from Arab. msk, the VI form of which, tama&#770;saka, corresponds to &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;), means a place that does not admit of the water soaking in, but on account of the firmness of the soil preserves it standing or flowing. What are here meant are the water-courses or river beds that hold the water. It is only needful for Jahve to threaten (epitiman <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>) and the floods, in which he, whose rescue is undertaken here, is sunk, flee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a>) and dry up (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>). But he is already half engulfed in the abyss of Hades, hence not merely the bed of the flood is opened up, but the earth is rent to its very centre. From the language being here so thoroughly allegorical, it is clear that we were quite correct in interpreting the description as ideal. He, who is nearly overpowered by his foes, is represented as one engulfed in deep waters and almost drowning. </body></html>
