Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore.

The word girdeth contains an allusion to the mode of dress among the orientals, the long flowing robe, which was girded up when they ran or labored, that it might not impede them; and, probably, with the additional idea that girding the loins contributed to strength. It is a common custom now for men who run a race, or leap, or engage in a strife of pugilism, to gird or bind up their loins. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-7.htm">Job 40:7</a>, note; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-41</a>, notes.<p>And maketh my way perfect - Gives me complete success in my undertakings; or, enables me so to carry them out that none of them fail. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30-32.

For battle, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-39.htm">Psalm 18:39</a>; with strength of body and fortitude of mind; both which are from the Lord, and were in David; and were acknowledged by him as bestowed on him by the Lord; and which confirms what he had before said of him: or with spiritual strength, with strength in his soul, against sin, Satan, and the world; and to do the will and work of God: saints are girt by the Lord with the whole armour of God, and among the rest with the girdle of truth; and are prepared and ready to every good work; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>. Hannah's song is again referred to: in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-33.htm">2 Samuel 22:33</a>, the words are, "God is my strength and power"; they are true of Christ, the man of God's right hand, whom he promised to strengthen, and whom he has made strong for himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a>; <p>and maketh my way perfect; or safe, or prosperous. God removed every impediment and obstacle out of his way, and made it plain and easy, as Jarchi observes; and succeeded him, and gave him victory over his enemies; this has been verified in Christ, who has conquered sin, Satan, the world, death, and the grave: for this is not to be understood of the way and course of David's life and conversation, which was not perfect and unspotted, but had many blemishes and imperfections in it, which he often owns, confesses, and bewails. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>It is</i> God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> way perfect.</span><p>(z) He gives good success to all my enterprises.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>.

Freely formed Hithpaels are used with these attributive words to give expression to the corresponding self-manifestation: &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501; (Ges. 54, 2, b), &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, and &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500; (to show one's self &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500; or &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;). The fervent love of the godly man God requites with confiding love, the entire submission of the upright with a full measure of grace, the endeavour after purity by an unbeclouded charity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-1.htm">Psalm 73:1</a>), moral perverseness by paradoxical judgments, giving the perverse over to his perverseness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>) and leading him by strange ways to final condemnation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23</a>.). The truth, which is here enunciated, is not that the conception which man forms of God is the reflected image of his own mind and heart, but that God's conduct to man is the reflection of the relation in which man has placed himself to God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>. This universal truth is illustrated and substantiated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-28.htm">Psalm 18:28</a>. The people who are bowed down by affliction experience God's condescension, to their salvation; and their haughty oppressors, god's exaltation, to their humiliation. Lofty, proud eyes are among the seven things that Jahve hateth, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a>.
