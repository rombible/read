Or, he means that he would give thanks to Jehovah, in the presence of those Gentiles who resorted to Jerusalem in great numbers, and before others of them who were either subject to him, or confederate with him, as he should have occasion of speaking or writing to any of them. It is probable, however, that David was here transported beyond himself, and spoke this with a special reference to Christ, who was to be his seed, of whom he was an eminent type, and by whom, what he here mentions, was most eminently done. Accordingly these words are applied to him, and to his calling of the Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm" title="And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.">Romans 15:9</a>. <span class="ital">Great deliverance giveth he to his king — </span>The king whom he himself hath chosen and constituted.

Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore.

The marginal reading is a literal translation of the Hebrew. The meaning is, that God had punished the enemies of the author of the psalm for all the wrongs which they had done to him. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>.<p>And subdueth the people under me - Margin, destroyeth. The idea is that he had subdued the nations so that they became obedient to him. The primary notion of the word used here - from &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;  da&#770;bar - is to set in a row; to range in order; to connect; to lead; to guide; - then, to reduce to order; to subdue. This God had done in respect to the nations. Instead of being rebellious and tumultuous, God had reduced them to obedience, and had thus set him over a kingdom where all were subject to order and to law. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47, 48. avengeth me&#8212;His cause is espoused by God as His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That avengeth me; </span> that executed vengeance both by me against malicious enemies, and for me against Saul, of whom I would not avenge myself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It is God that avengeth me,.... Or "gives vengeance unto me", or "for me" (t): vengeance only belongs to God, and he repays it for and in behalf of his people. Private revenge is not to be exercised by any; public vengeance on delinquents may be exercised by the civil magistrate, to whom God gives power and authority to exercise it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; as he did to David, as king of Israel; though the phrase rather seems to design the victories which he obtained over his enemies, which were punishments to them, vengeances inflicted on them; and owing to God; so the acceptable year of the Messiah's coming, and the time of his people redeemed by him, is called the day of vengeance of our God, both on his and their enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a>; <p>and subdueth the people under me; the Edomites, Moabites, and others, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>, or the Gentiles under Christ; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-39.htm">Psalm 18:39</a>; <p>(t)   "qui dat ultiones mihi", Pagninus, Gejerus; so Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Musculus, Cocceius, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">47</span>.

Such a thanksgiving as this does not shew a spirit of vindictiveness in David, but is a recognition that God had ‘pleaded his cause,’ and maintained the right. God had avenged him for the cruel injustice of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-12.htm" title="The LORD judge between me and you, and the LORD avenge me of you: but my hand shall not be on you.">1 Samuel 24:12</a>); for the contemptuous insults of Nabal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-39.htm" title="And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept his servant from evil: for the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.">1 Samuel 25:39</a>); for the factious opposition of those who refused to acknowledge him as king in spite of his Divine call (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-8.htm" title="And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul your enemy, which sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.">2 Samuel 4:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The second line of the verse refers, like <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-43.htm" title="You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; and you have made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.">Psalm 18:43</a></span>, to success in overcoming internal as well as external opposition to his rule.

Since we do not pulverize dust but to dust, &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512; is to be taken as describing the result: so that they became as dust (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-30.htm">Job 38:30</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1503;, so that it is become like stone, and the extreme of such pregnant brevity of expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) before the wind (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>, before the front). The second figure is to be explained differently: I emptied them out (&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;&#1501; from &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;) like the dirt of the streets, i.e., not merely: so that they became such, but as one empties it out, - thus contemptuously, ignominiously and completely (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-5.htm">Zechariah 10:5</a>).
