The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin.

It is probably in allusion to this idea that the phrase "The Lord liveth" is used here. It is a joyful exclamation in view of all that God had done; of all the deliverances which he had performed for the author of the psalm. In the remembrance of all this the psalmist says that God had shown himself to be the living, that is, the true God. These interpositions furnished abundant demonstration that Yahweh existed, and that he was worthy of adoration and praise as the true God. So, in view of mercy and salvation, the heart of the redeemed exultingly exclaims, "The Lord lives - there is a living God."<p>And blessed be my Rock - God, who has shown himself to be a refuge and a protector.

To rejoice in personal revenge is unhallowed and evil, but David viewed himself as the instrument of vengeance upon the enemies of God and his people, and had he not rejoiced in the success accorded to him he would have been worthy of censure. That sinners perish is in itself a painful consideration, but that the Lord's law is avenged upon those who break it is to the devout mind a theme for thankfulness. We must, however, always remember that vengeance is never ours, vengeance belongeth unto the Lord, and he is so just and withal so long-suffering in the excercise of it, that we may safely leave its administration in his hands.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a><p>From all enemies, and especially from one who was pre-eminent in violence, the Lord's anointed was preserved, and at the last over the head of Saul and all other adversaries he reigned in honour.

This, with what follows, is the concluding part of the psalm, which ends with a celebration of the Divine Being, and with thankfulness for mercies received from him. The psalmist praises him on account of what he is in himself, what he was to him, and had done for him: in himself he is the living God, "the Lord liveth": he has life in himself, essentially, originally, and independently; and is the fountain and author of life to all others, even to all creatures that have life, whether rational or irrational: he is the giver of natural life to all men, and the supporter of it; and of spiritual and eternal life to his chosen people; and he continues to live, and ever will; wherefore the saints may conclude that their life in every sense is safe and secure. Some render the phrase, by way of wish, "may the Lord live" (r); but then it must be understood only that he would show himself more abundantly to be the living God, and that he might be acknowledged so by others. The next clauses are by way of petition; "and blessed be my Rock"; on which he was built and established, to which he betook himself in times of distress, which was his place of defence, and from whence he had a supply; wherefore he desires he might be blessed, not by invoking or conferring a blessing on him, neither of which can be; there being none greater than he to call upon, and he being "Elshaddai", God all sufficient, and in no need of any; but by declaring his blessedness, by celebrating his greatness and goodness, and by ascribing blessing and honour and glory to him; <p>and let the God of my salvation be exalted; God was the God of his salvation in a temporal sense, saving him daily from his many enemies; and in a spiritual sense, being the contriver, author, and applier of it to him; on which account he would have him be exalted both by himself, and in the high praises of his people; ascribing the whole of salvation to him, and giving him all the glory of it. Some render the words, "the God of my salvation is high" (s); he is the most high God, the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, and is above all others. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-47.htm">2 Samuel 22:47</a> the words are read, "and exalted be the God of the Rock of my salvation". <p>(r)  "vivat Jehova", Musculus, Tigurine version, Piscator, Muis; so some in Vatablus, Ainsworth.

He is the Living God in contrast to the dead idols of the heathen. The experience of David’s life is summed up in these words. It had been to him a certain proof that God is the living, active Ruler of the world. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-10.htm" title="And Joshua said, Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.">Joshua 3:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and let</span> &c.] R.V., and exalted be the God of my salvation.

Concluding thanksgiving and doxology.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 46-50.</span> - This glorious and triumphant psalm concludes with a solemn ascription of praise, blessing, and thanksgiving to Almighty God - partly recapitulation of what has preceded (vers. 47, 48), partly additional (vers. 46, 49, 50). Terms of praise are accumulated, and the whole is made to culminate in a Messianic burst, where David is swallowed up in his "Seed;" and the "Anointed King" presented to our view is rather the antitype than the type - rather Christ Jesus than the son of Jesse. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord liveth</span>. God was known to Israel as "the living God" from the time of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>). The epithet exalted him above all other so-called gods, who were not living (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-4.htm">Isaiah 37:4, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>). But it had also a very precious, absolute meaning. God's life was the source of man's. It was through God (who had life in himself) breathing into man the breath of life that man became a living soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Hence "the living God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-2.htm">Psalm 42:2</a>) is "the God of our life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And blessed be my Rock</span> (see vers. 1, 31). In blessing "his Rock," David blesses God for his qualities of firmness, steadfastness,  and trustworthiness. And let the God of my salvation be exalted. "The God of my salvation" is a favourite phrase with David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-14.htm">Psalm 51:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-1.htm">Psalm 88:1</a>). Other writers use it rarely. When David prays that the God of his salvation (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the God who continually saves him and preserves him) may be "exalted," he probably desires that he may be praised and honoured of all men. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:38-41) Thus in God's strength, with the armour of God, and by God's assistance in fight, he smote, cast down, and utterly destroyed all his foes in foreign and in civil wars.

The phrase &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;, however, which in other passages has those fleeing as its subject (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>), is here differently applied: Thou gavest, or madest me mine enemies a back, i.e., those who turn back, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-13.htm">Psalm 21:13</a> (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501;, Symm. &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;) it becomes clear that &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; is not an accusative of the member beside the accusative of the person (as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-11.htm">Deuteronomy 33:11</a>), but an accusative of the factitive object according to Ges. 139, 2.</body></html>
