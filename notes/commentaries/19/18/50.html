The change to the third person is certainly somewhat suggestive of this, but by no means conclusive.<p>The question of the relation of the two copies of this hymn to each other is far too complicated and difficult for discussion here. Each has been again and again claimed as the original. The best explanation of the variations is that the compositions were independent copies of some original, and that the psalm, like many others, was altered in preparation for the choir use.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:32, and the following verses, are the gifts of God to the spiritual warrior, whereby he is prepared for the contest, after the example of his victorious Leader. Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore.

The word in the original, which is rendered "deliverance," means properly salvations, and is here in the plural number. It refers not to one act of divine interposition, but to the many acts (referred to in the psalm) in which God had interposed to save him from danger and from death. The phrase "to his king" refers to the fact that God had appointed him to reign, and to administer the government for him. He did not reign on his own account, but he reigned for God, and with a view to do his will.<p>And showeth mercy to his anointed - To him who had been set apart to the kingly office by a solemn act of anointing. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4-7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-3.htm">2 Kings 9:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-12.htm">2 Kings 9:12</a>. It is in allusion to this custom that the Messiah is called the Anointed, or the Christ. See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>.<p>To David, and to his seed - To his descendants, or posterity. There is an undoubted reference here to the promises made to David in regard to his successors on the throne. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-25.htm">2 Samuel 7:25-26</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19-37</a>.<p>Forevermore - This expresses the confident expectation of David that the government would remain in his family to the latest times. This expectation was founded on such promises as that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a> : "I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom; he shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever." Also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a> : "And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee; thy throne shall be established forever." See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> : "His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me." The perpetuity of this kingdom is found, in fact, in the reign of the Messiah, a descendant of David, in whose eternal reign these promises will receive an ample fulfillment. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>. The temporal reign passed wholly away in the process of time from the descendants of David; the spiritual reign is perpetual in the Messiah. How far David understood this it is not important to inquire, and it would be impossible to determine. It is sufficient for the proper understanding of the place to remember<p>(a) that there will have been a strict fulfillment of the promise, according to the full import of the language, in the Messiah, the Son of David; and<p>(b) that, however this may have been understood by David who recorded the promise, the real author of the promise was the Holy Spirit, and that the real meaning of the promise, as thus recorded, was that it should be fulfilled as it has been.<p>In this, as in all other cases, the inquiry to be made in interpreting the language is not how the sacred penman understood it, but what was meant by the real author, the Spirit of God - and whether the prediction, according to that meaning, has been fulfilled. When a man employs an amanuensis, the inquiry in regard to what is written is not how the amanuensis understood it, but how he who dictated what was written intended it should be understood. Applying this principle, the prediction here and elsewhere, in regard to the perpetuity of the reign of David and his posterity, has been, and is, fulfilled in the most ample manner. "Great David's greater Son" shall reign forever and ever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>49, 50. Paul (Ro 15:9) quotes from this doxology to show that under the Old Testament economy, others than the Jews were regarded as subjects of that spiritual government of which David was head, and in which character his deliverances and victories were typical of the more illustrious triumphs of David's greater Son. The language of Ps 18:50 justifies this view in its distinct allusion to the great promise (compare 2Sa 7:12). In all David's successes he saw the pledges of a fulfilment of that promise, and he mourned in all his adversities, not only in view of his personal suffering, but because he saw in them evidences of danger to the great interests which were committed to his keeping. It is in these aspects of his character that we are led properly to appreciate the importance attached to his sorrows and sufferings, his joys and successes.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To his king; </span> to the king whom God himself chose, and anointed, or constituted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To his seed; </span> to all his posterity, and especially to the Messias, who is called David’s Seed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-23.htm" title="Of this man's seed has God according to his promise raised to Israel a Savior, Jesus:">Acts 13:23</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a></span>; and his <span class="ital">Son</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm" title="Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.">Psalm 89:27</a> 90:1</span>, compared with <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm" title="Saying, What think you of Christ? whose son is he?

These closing words may be due to a later poet, who thus sums up the lessons of the Psalm. But they may well be David’s own.

God had then "saluted" David as "his servant" (ver. 5), and sent him a message of the most gracious character, even promising the kingdom to him and to his seed "for ever" (vers. 13, 16). <span class="cmt_word">And showeth mercy to his anointed, to David</span>. No doubt David is primarily intended, both by the "king" of the first clause, and by the "anointed" of the second; but the combination of the two, and the immediate mention of the "seed" which is to reign "for ever," carry the passage beyond the psalmist individually, and give to the conclusion of the psalm, at any rate, a semi-Messianic character. As Hengstenberg says, "Psalms of this kind are distinguished from those which may more strictly be called Messianic, only by this - that in the latter the Messiah <span class="accented">exclusively</span> is brought into view, while here he is presented to our notice only as a member of the seed of David" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 324, Engl. trans.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:44-46) Thus victorious in God, David became what he now is, viz., the ruler of a great kingdom firmly established both in home and foreign relations. With respect to the &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; and the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497; which follows, &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1506;&#1501; can only be understood of the conflicts among his own people, in which David was involved by the persecution of Saul and the rebellions of Absolom and Sheba the son of Bichri; and from which Jahve delivered him, in order to preserve him for his calling of world-wide dominion in accordance with the promise. We therefore interpret the passage according to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>, and &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>; whereas the following &#1506;&#1501; comes to have a foreign application by reason of the attributive clause &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (Ges. 123, 3). The Niph. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a> is the reflexive of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, to obey (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>), and is therefore to be rendered: show themselves obedient ( equals  Ithpa. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>). &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503; implies more than that they obeyed at the word; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; means information, rumour, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503; is the opposite of personal observation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>), it is therefore to be rendered: they submitted even at the tidings of my victories; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>. is an example of this. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; to lie, disown, feign, and flatter, is sued here, as it is frequently, of the extorted humility which the vanquished show towards the conqueror. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-46.htm">Psalm 18:46</a> completes the picture of the reason of the sons of a foreign country "putting a good face on a bad game." They faded away, i.e., they became weak and faint-hearted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-18.htm">Exodus 18:18</a>), incapable of holding out against or breaking through any siege by David, and trembled, surrendering at discretion, out of their close places, i.e., out of their strongholds behind which they had shut themselves in (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-8.htm">Psalm 142:8</a>). The signification of being alarmed, which in this instance, being found in combination with a local &#1502;&#1503;, is confined to the sense of terrified flight, is secured to the verb &#1495;&#1512;&#1490; by the Arabic h&#803;arija (root h&#803;r, of audible pressure, crowding, and the like) to be pressed, crowded, tight, or narrow, to get in a strait, and the Targumic &#1495;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; &#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;&#1488; &#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488; (vid., the Targums on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>). Arab. h&#803;jl, to limp, halt, which is compared by Hitzig, is far removed as to the sound; and the most natural, but colourless Arab. chrj, to go out of (according to its radical meaning - cf. Arab. chrq, chr&#8219;, etc. - : to break forth, erumpere), cannot be supported in Hebrew or Aramaic. The &#1497;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; found in the borrowed passage in Micah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>, favours our rendering. </body></html>
