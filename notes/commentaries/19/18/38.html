Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore.

Which was not only true of the Amalekites, but of all with whom David engaged in war; <p>they are fallen under my feet; either dead, or become subject and tributaries to him; as the Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, and Edomites; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>. This, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-37.htm">Psalm 18:37</a>, may very well be accommodated to David's antitype, and be expressive of the entire victory he has obtained over all his and his people's enemies; he wounded the heads over many countries, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-6.htm">Psalm 110:6</a>. Satan and his principalities and powers, whose head is broke, whose works are destroyed; yea, he himself, which had the power of death, so as not to be able to rise more against Christ, who has led captivity captive: he has also finished and made an end of sin, and overcome the world; nor did he turn back from this work he engaged in until he had made a complete conquest; and moreover he has likewise made his people more than conquerors, through him, over these same enemies; so that the words are also applicable to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">38</span>. <span class="ital">I have wounded them</span>] Rather, I have smitten them through (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-11.htm" title="Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.">Deuteronomy 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm" title="He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.">Job 26:12</a>). 2 Sam. has “Yea I consumed them, and smote them through,” the first verb being probably a gloss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The R.V. renders the verbs in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/18-37.htm" title="I have pursued my enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed....">Psalm 18:37-38</a></span> as futures (<span class="ital">I will pursue</span>, &c.), but it is best to regard these verses, like those which precede and those which follow, as a retrospect.

It is remarkable that the nations which David subdued scarcely ever, while he lived, rose up again in revolt. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:32-35) The grateful description of the tokens of favour he has experienced takes a new flight, and is continued in the second half of the Psalm in a more varied and less artificial mixture of the strophes. What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a> of the way and word of Jahve and of Jahve Himself, is confirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-32.htm">Psalm 18:32</a> by the fact that He alone is &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, a divine being to be reverenced, and He alone is &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, a rock, i.e., a ground of confidence that cannot be shaken. What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a> consequently can be said only of Him. &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; and &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; alternate; the former (with a negative intensive &#1502;&#1503;) signifies "without reference to" and then absolutely "without" or besides, and the latter (with &#305;&#770; as a connecting vowel, which elsewhere has also the function of a suffix), from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;), "exception." The verses immediately following are attached descriptively to &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, our God (i.e., the God of Israel), the God, who girded me with strength; and accordingly (fut. consec.) made my way &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "perfect," i.e., absolutely smooth, free from stumblings and errors, leading straight forward to a divine goal. The idea is no other than that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-3.htm">Job 22:3</a>, except that the freedom from error here is intended to be understood in accordance with its reference to the way of a man, of a king, and of a warrior; cf. moreover, the other text. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; signifies, like Arab. swwa&#770;, to make equal (aequare), to arrange, to set right; the dependent passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a> has, instead of this verb, the more uncoloured &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. The hind, &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, is the perfection of swiftness (cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) and also of gracefulness among animals. "Like the hinds" is equivalent to like hinds' feet; the Hebrew style leaves it to the reader to infer the appropriate point of comparison from the figure. It is not swiftness in flight (De Wette), but in attack and pursuit that is meant, - the latter being a prominent characteristic of warriors, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>. David does not call the high places of the enemy, which he has made his own by conquest "my high places," but those heights of the Holy Land which belong to him as king of Israel: upon these Jahve preserves him a firm position, so that from them he may rule the land far and wide, and hold them victoriously (cf. passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-14.htm">Isaiah 58:14</a>). The verb &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;, which has a double accusative in other instances, is here combined with &#1500; of the subject taught, as the aim of the teaching. The verb &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; (to press down  equals  to bend a bow) precedes the subject "my arms" in the singular; this inequality is admissible even when the subject stands first (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>). &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; a bow of brazen  equals  of brass, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>. It is also the manner of heroes in Homer and in the Ram-jana to press down and bend with their hand a brazen bow, one end of which rests on the ground. </body></html>
