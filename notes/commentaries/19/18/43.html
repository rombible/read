By this it appears, that this is spoken with reference to David, and not (as some would have it) to Christ; because Christ’s people are a willing people, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm" title="Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.">Psalm 110:3</a>,) and those whom he conquers freely obey him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:32, and the following verses, are the gifts of God to the spiritual warrior, whereby he is prepared for the contest, after the example of his victorious Leader. Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore.

The allusion is to the efforts made by the people, under the guidance of their leaders. It is not "strivings" among his own followers, but the efforts, the strivings, the contentions of his enemies, who endeavored to obtain the mastery over him, and to subdue him.<p>Thou hast made me the head of the heathen - The head of the nations; that is, the nations round about. In other words, he had, by the divine aid, brought them into subjection to him, or so subdued them that they became tributary to him. The word "heathen" with us expresses an idea which is not necessarily connected with the original word. That word is simply nations - &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;  go&#770;yim. It is true that those nations were pagans in the present sense of the term, but that idea is not necessarily connected with the word. The meaning is, that surrounding nations had been made subject to him; or that he had been made to rule over them. David, in fact, thus brought the surrounding people under subjection to him, and made them tributary. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a> he is said to have subdued Philistia, and Moab, and Syria, and Edom, in all of which countries he put "garrisons," and all of which he made tributary to himself.<p>A people whom I have not known shall serve me - People that I had not before heard of. This is the language of confident faith that his kingdom would be still further extended, so as to embrace nations before unknown to him. His past victories, and the fact that his kingdom had been so established and was already so extended, justified the expectation that it would still be further enlarged; that the fame of his conquests would reach other nations, and that they would willingly yield themselves to him. After the victories which he had achieved, as celebrated in this psalm, that might be expected to follow as a matter of course. It is the triumphant exultation of a conqueror, and it seems to have been his expectation, not that his successors would extend the empire, but, that other nations would become voluntarily subject to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>43-45.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>, it is read "my people", meaning the people of Israel; either Saul and his men, who contended with David, and sought his life; or rather the tribes of Israel, who, after Saul's death, refused to acknowledge David as their king, but afterwards came and anointed him in Hebron. The words may very well be interpreted of the contentions of the Scribes and Pharisees with Christ, and of the opposition from sinners, which he for a while endured, but is now delivered from them all; <p>and thou hast made me the head of the Heathen; which, if understood of David, refers to the Philistines, Syrians, Moabites, and Edomites, being subdued by him, and becoming tributaries to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>. But it best agrees with Christ, who is the head of his chosen ones among the Gentiles; the political head, King, and Governor of them, the Heathen being given him for his inheritance and possession; and which appeared in the first ages of Christianity, when the Gospel was first preached to the Gentiles by the apostles; and still continues, and will be more clearly seen in the latter day, when the Lord shall be King over all the earth. Christ was made the head of the Heathen, by the appointment and designation of his Father; and, in fact, was so when multitudes from among the Gentiles were converted and brought to the obedience of him. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a> it is, "thou hast kept me to be head of the Heathen"; which does not seem so much to intend the designation and constitution of him as such, but the continuation of him; and denotes the stability of his government in the Gentile world, of which there will be no end; <p>a people whom I have not known shall serve me; by whom are meant the Gentiles, who were not the people of God, were without Christ and without God, and without hope in the world: not that there are any people that can be unknown to Christ, as he is the omniscient God; nor were these unknown to him, in such sense as reprobates, nominal professors, and foolish virgins, are said not to be known by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>. For these people among the Heathen, who are or shall be brought to serve the Lord, are such who were the objects of his love and delight from everlasting; were in his Father's choice and in his own, and in the gift of his Father to him, and in the covenant of his grace; and therefore must be known by him; moreover, they are the purchase of his blood; and the sheep he knows, for whom he has laid down his life, and of whom he has such an exact and particular knowledge, that he can and does call them by name. But the sense is, these seemed not to be taken notice of and cared for by Christ; they were not owned and acknowledged by him as his people; the Jews were distinguished from all others; they only had the law, the word of God, and his ordinances; the Gentiles were suffered to walk in their own ways; they were neglected, and the times of their ignorance were overlooked and disregarded; so that they were treated as a people that were not known for many hundreds of years: but here it is predicted, that when the Gospel should come among them, and they be called by it, they should "serve" the Lord in righteousness and true holiness, with reverence and godly fear, from a principle of love, in his name and strength, and to his glory; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; <i>and</i> thou hast made me the head of the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> heathen: a people <i>whom</i> I have not <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> known shall serve me.</span><p>(g) Who dwell round about me.<p>(h) The kingdom of Christ is prefigured in David's kingdom, who by the preaching of his word brings all to his subjection.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">43</span>. <span class="ital">from the strivings of the people</span>] 2 Sam. has “from the strivings of my people,” and the reference seems to be to the civil war and internal dissension which disturbed the early years of David’s reign, while Saul’s house still endeavoured to maintain its position. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-1.htm" title="Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.">2 Samuel 3:1</a>. Through all these conflicts he had been safely brought, and made the head of the nations, supreme among surrounding peoples, See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/8-1.htm" title="And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines....">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm" title="Ask of me, and I shall give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.">Psalm 2:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou hast made me</span>] In 2 Sam. “thou hast preserved me to be the head of the nations.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a people</span> whom <span class="ital">I have not known shall serve me</span>] Rather, a people whom I knew not did serve meb. There is no reason for the sudden transition of the A.V. to the future here and in the two following verses. David is still thankfully recounting how God had raised him to his present eminence. There may be a special reference to the subjugation of the Syrians and their allies, whom he might well describe as “a people whom he had not known.” See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm" title="Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">2 Samuel 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-19.htm" title="And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them.

In one verse he at once sums up his past deliverances and anticipates fresh glories. God has delivered him from the strivings of those who were hostile to him among his own people (see vers. 4-18), and has also given him victory over the heathen. In the future he will do even more. <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast made me the head of the heathen</span>. The antithesis between "people" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>) and "heathen," or "nations" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), is unmistakable. The long series of David's victories have made him "head" over the latter. This is less clearly seen in the history of David's reign than in the description given of the state of the kingdom inherited from David by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A people whom I have not known shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">serve me</span>. It is not clear that this was ever fulfilled literally in the person of David, and, we are entitled to explain it as a Messianic prophecy, parallel with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:38-41) Thus in God's strength, with the armour of God, and by God's assistance in fight, he smote, cast down, and utterly destroyed all his foes in foreign and in civil wars. According to the Hebrew syntax the whole of this passage is a retrospect. The imperfect signification of the futures in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-38.htm">Psalm 18:38</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-39.htm">Psalm 18:39</a> is made clear from the aorist which appears in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-40.htm">Psalm 18:40</a>, and from the perfects and futures in what follows it. The strophe begins with an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a> (cf. supra <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>).

The phrase &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;, however, which in other passages has those fleeing as its subject (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>), is here differently applied: Thou gavest, or madest me mine enemies a back, i.e., those who turn back, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-13.htm">Psalm 21:13</a> (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501;, Symm. &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;) it becomes clear that &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; is not an accusative of the member beside the accusative of the person (as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-11.htm">Deuteronomy 33:11</a>), but an accusative of the factitive object according to Ges. 139, 2.</body></html>
