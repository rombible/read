Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He bowed the heavens also - He seemed to bend down the heavens - to bring them nearer to the earth. "He inclines the canopy of the heavens, as it were, toward the earth; wraps himself in the darkness of night, and shoots forth his arrows; hurls abroad his lightnings, and wings them with speed." Herder, Spirit of Hebrew Poetry (Marsh), ii. 157. The allusion is still to the tempest, when the clouds ran low; when they seem to sweep along the ground; when it appears as if the heavens were brought nearer to the earth - as if, to use a common expression, "the heavens and earth were coming together."<p>And came down - God himself seemed to descend in the fury of the storm.<p>And darkness was under his feet - A dark cloud; or, the darkness caused by thick clouds.

In a storm the clouds do actually descend, and the whole heaven seems to be bowed down to earth.

So far as regards the parallelism of the members, a monostich forms the beginning of this Psalm, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1-11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25.htm">Psalm 25</a> and many others. Nevertheless the matter assumes a somewhat different aspect, if <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a> is not, with Maurer, Hengstenberg and Hupfeld, taken as two predicate clauses (Jahve is..., my God is...), but as a simple vocative-a rendering which alone corresponds to the intensity with which this greatest of the Davidic hymns opens-God being invoked by &#1492;, &#1492;, &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, and each of these names being followed by a predicative expansion of itself, which increases in fulness of tone and emphasis. The &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1498; (with a&#772;, according to Ew. &#1431;251, b), which carries the three series of the names of God, makes up in depth of meaning what is wanting in compass. Elsewhere we find only the Piel &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; of tender sympathising love, but here the Kal is used as an Aramaism. Hence the Jalkut on this passages explains it by &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497; &#1497;&#1514;&#1498; "I love thee," or ardent, heartfelt love and attachment. The primary signification of softness (root &#1512;&#1495;, Arab. rh&#803;, rch, to be soft, lax, loose), whence &#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, uterus, is transferred in both cases to tenderness of feeling or sentiment. The most general predicate &#1495;&#1494;&#1508;&#1497; (from &#1495;&#1494;&#1511; according to a similar inflexion to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;, plur. &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1497; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>) is followed by those which describe Jahve as a protector and deliverer in persecution on the one hand, and on the other as a defender and the giver of victory in battle. They are all typical names symbolising what Jahve is in Himself; hence instead of &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497; it would perhaps have been more correct to point &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; (and my refuge). God had already called Himself a shield to Abram, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; and He is called &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (cf. &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>) in the great Mosaic song, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a> (the latter verse is distinctly echoed here).<p>&#1505;&#1500;&#1506; from &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;, Arab. sl&#8219;, findere, means properly a cleft in a rock (Arabic &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;, <p>(Note: Neshwn defines thus: Arab. 'l-sal&#8219; is a cutting in a mountain after the manner of a gorge; and Jkt, who cites a number of places that are so called: a wide plain (Arab. fd&#803;') enclosed by steep rocks, which is reached through a narrow pass (Arab. s&#780;a&#8219;b), but can only be descended on foot. Accordingly, in &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497; the idea of a safe (and comfortable) hiding-place preponderates; in &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; that of firm ground and inaccessibility. The one figure calls to mind the (well-watered) Edomitish &#1505;&#1500;&#1506; surrounded with precipitous rocks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>, the &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; described by Strabo, xvi. 4, 21; the other calls to mind the Phoenician rocky island &#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, S&#803;u&#770;r (Tyre), the refuge in the sea.))<p>then a cleft rock, and &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, like the Arabic sachr, a great and hard mass of rock (Aramaic &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, a mountain). The figures of the &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; (&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1491;) and the &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; are related; the former signifies properly specula, a watch-tower, <p>(Note: In Arabic mas&#803;a&#770;dun signifies (1) a high hill (a signification that is wanting in Freytag), (2) the summit of a mountain, and according to the original lexicons it belongs to the root Arab. mas&#803;ada, which in outward appearance is supported by the synonymous forms Arab. mas&#803;adun and mas&#803;dun, as also by their plurals Arab. ams&#803;idatun and mus&#803;da&#770;nun, wince these can only be properly formed from those singulars on the assumption of the m being part of the root. Nevertheless, since the meanings of Arab. mas&#803;ada all distinctly point to its being formed from the root Arab. ms&#803; contained in the reduplicated stem Arab. mas&#803;s&#803;a, to suck, but the meanings of Arab. mas&#803;a&#770;dun, mas&#803;sadun, and mas&#803;dun do not admit of their being referred to it, and moreover there are instances in which original nn. loci from vv. med. Arab. w and y admit of the prefixed m being treated as the first radical through forgetfulness or disregard of their derivation, and with the retention of its from secondary roots (as Arab. makana, madana, mas&#803;s&#803;ara), it is highly probable that in mas&#803;a&#770;d, mas&#803;ad and mas&#803;d we have an original &#1502;&#1510;&#1491;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;. These Hebrew words, however, are to be referred to a &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification to look out, therefore properly specula. - Fleischer.)<p>and the latter, a steep height. The horn, which is an ancient figure of victorious and defiant power in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>, is found here applied to Jahve Himself: "horn of my salvation" is that which interposes on the side of my feebleness, conquers, and saves me. All these epithets applied to God are the fruits of the affliction out of which David's song has sprung, viz., his persecution by Saul, when, in a country abounding in rugged rocks and deficient in forest, he betook himself to the rocks for safety, and the mountains served him as his fortresses. In the shelter which the mountains, by their natural conformations, afforded him at that time, and in the fortunate accidents, which sometimes brought him deliverance when in extreme peril, David recognises only marvellous phenomena of which Jahve Himself was to him the final cause. The confession of the God tried and known in many ways is continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a> by a general expression of his experience. &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; is a predicate accusative to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;: As one praised (worthy to be praised) do I call upon Jahve, - a rendering that is better suited to the following clause, which expresses confidence in the answer coinciding with the invocation, which is to be thought of as a cry for help, than Olshausen's, "Worthy of praise, do I cry, is Jahve," though this latter certainly is possible so far as the style is concerned (vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>, cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-3.htm">Genesis 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>). The proof of this fact, viz., that calling upon Him who is worthy to be praised, who, as the history of Israel shows, is able and willing to help, is immediately followed by actual help, as events that are coincident, forms the further matter of the Psalm. </body></html>
