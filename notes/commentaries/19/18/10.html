This passage alone would show how naturally the idea of winged attendants on the Divine Being grew out of the phenomena of cloud and storm. No doubt many features of the developed conception were derived from contact with Assyrian art, but for the poetry of this passage we have only to think of those giant pinions into which cloud so often shapes itself, this clause being in close parallelism with “wings of the wind.” The variation in Samuel, “appeared” for “did fly,” is, no doubt, a transcriber’s error.

Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he rode upon a cherub - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>, note. The cherub in the theology of the Hebrews was a figurative representation of power and majesty, under the image of a being of a high and celestial nature, "whose form is represented as composed from the figures of a man, ox, lion, and eagle," <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>; 10. Cherubs are first mentioned as guarding the gates of Paradise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; then as bearing the throne of God upon their wings through the clouds, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>; 10; and also as statues or images made of wood and overlaid with gold, over the cover of the ark, in the inner sanctuary of the tabernacle, and of the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18</a> ff; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-28</a>. Between the two cherubim in the temple, the Shechinah, or visible symbol of the presence of God, rested; and hence, God is represented as "dwelling between the cherubim," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>. The cherubim are not to be regarded as real existences, or as an order of angels like the seraphim <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2-3</a>, but as an imaginary representation of majesty, as emblematic of the power and glory of God. Here God is represented as "riding on a cherub;" that is, as coming forth on the clouds regarded as a cherub (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>), as if, seated on his throne, he was borne along in majesty and power amidst the storm and tempest.<p>And did fly - He seemed to move rapidly on the flying clouds.<p>Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind - Rapidly as the clouds driven along by the wind. The "wings of the wind" are designed to represent the rapidity with which the wind sweeps along. Rapid motion is represented by the flight of birds; hence, the term wings is applied to winds to denote the rapidity of their movement. The whole figure here is designed to represent; the majesty with which God seemed to be borne along on the tempest. Herder renders it, "He flew on the wings of the storm." <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>Who maketh the clouds his chariot,<p>Who walketh upon the wings of the wind.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. cherub&#8212;angelic agents (compare Ge 3:24), the figures of which were placed over the ark (1Sa 4:4), representing God's dwelling; used here to enhance the majesty of the divine advent.

The Targum renders it in the plural number, "cherubim"; and so the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions; and by whom may be meant, either the angels, who are as horses and chariots, on whom Jehovah rides, and who art he makes use of as executioners of his wrath and vengeance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>; and to whom wings are assigned as a token of swiftness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>; or rather the ministers of the Gospel, who are the living creatures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>; and answer to the "cherubim" in Ezekiel's visions; and whom God made use of, especially after the death of Christ, and when the Gospel was rejected by the Jews, to carry it into the Gentile world, which was done by them with great speed and swiftness; and Maimonides (u) gives a caution, not to understand the phrase, "he did fly", as of God, but of the cherub; <p>yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind; which may design the speedy help and assistance God gave to his Son, and gives to his people; and the swift destruction of their enemies; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>; the words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a>, with only the variation of a letter in one word, are, "and he was seen upon the wings of the wind"; which were both true; nor need a various reading be supposed, the psalmist using both words at different times, suitable to his purpose, and which both express his sense.

David here appears as passive throughout; the hand from out of the clouds seizes him and draws him out of mighty waters: while in the second part of the Psalm, in fellowship with God and under His blessing, he comes forward as a free actor.<p>The description begins in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a> with the danger and the cry for help which is not in vain. The verb &#1488;&#1508;&#1507; according to a tradition not to be doubted (cf. &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503; a wheel) signifies to go round, surround, as a poetical synonym of &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, and not, as one might after the Arabic have thought: to drive, urge.
