Such he has always been, and he is still as ready to hear prayer as ever. The most encouraging principle of prayer, and the most powerful plea in prayer, is, to look upon him as our King and our God. David also prays to a sin-hating God. sin is folly, and sinners are the greatest of all fools; fools of their own making. Wicked people hate God; justly are they hated of him, and this will be their endless misery and ruin. Let us learn the importance of truth and sincerity, in all the affairs of life. Liars and murderers resemble the devil, and are his children, therefore it may well be expected that God should abhor them. These were the characters of David's enemies; and such as these are still the enemies of Christ and his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hearken unto the voice of my cry - My cry for assistance. The word "voice" refers to the utterance of his desires, or to his "expressed" wishes in a time of trouble.<p>My King, and my God - Though he was himself a king, yet he acknowledged his subjection to God as his supreme Ruler, and looked up to Him to protect him in his dangers, and to restore him to his rights. He was, at the same time, his God - his covenant God - to whom he felt that he was permitted to come in the hour of trouble, and whose blessing he was permitted to invoke.<p>For unto thee will I pray - He had no one else to go to in his troubles, and he felt that he "might" approach the living God. It was his fixed purpose - his regular habit - to pray to him, and to seek his favor and friendship, and he felt that he was permitted to do so now. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

In another Psalm we find the expression, "The voice of my weeping." Weeping has a voice - a melting, plaintive tone, an ear-piercing shrillness, which reaches the very heart of God: and crying hath a voice - a soul-moving eloquence; coming from our heart it reaches God's heart, Ah! my brothers and sisters, sometimes we cannot put our prayers into words: they are nothing but a cry: but the Lord can comprehend the meaning, for he hears a voice in our cry. To a loving father his children's cries are music, and they have a magic influence which his heart cannot resist. "My King and my God." Observe carefully these little pronouns, "my King, and my God." They are the pith and marrow of the plea. Here is a grand argument why God should answer prayer - because he is our King and our God. We are not aliens to him: he is the King of our country. Kings are expected to hear the appeals of their own people. We are not strangers to him; we are his worshippers, and he is our God: ours by covenant, by promise, by oath, by blood.<p>"For unto thee will I pray." Here David expresses his declaration that he will seek to God, and to God alone. God is to be the only object of worship: the only resource of our soul in times of need. Leave broken cisterns to the godless, and let the godly drink from the Divine fountain alone. "Unto thee will I pray." He makes a resolution, that as long as he lived he would pray. He would never cease to supplicate, even though the answer should not come. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is the part and duty of a king to answer the just and humble desires of his subjects. To thee alone will I direct all my prayers, and therefore from thee alone I expect succour and relief. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hearken unto the voice of my cry,.... Which seems to intend more than groans or words, even a loud outcry, as of a person in great distress; such as the strong crying of Christ, in the days of his flesh, when on the cross, forsaken by God, deserted by his friends, and surrounded by his enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>; and such, in some measure, was the case of David. The arguments used by him, that the Lord would hearken to him, are as follow: and the first is taken from his interest in the Lord, and his relation to him, <p>my King and my God; the Lord was David's King in a civil sense; though David was a king over others, yet the Lord, who is the King of kings, was King over him, and he owned him to be so; he was set upon the throne by him, had his kingdom from him, and was accountable to him: and he was his King in a natural sense, the kingdom of nature and providence belonging to him, as he was his Creator, preserver, protector, and defender; and in a spiritual sense, he being delivered from the dominion of other lords, sin, Satan, and the world, and brought to a subjection to him by his Spirit and grace; and so to own him as his King and Lawgiver, as well as his Saviour. And he was his God; not in a general way, as he is the God of the spirits of all flesh living; nor merely in the peculiar way in which he was the God of the people of Israel; but in a most special manner, as being his covenant God and Father in Christ. He was his God, not only as the God of nature and providence, but as the God of all grace; who had distinguished him by special and spiritual blessings and favours; and whom David loved, believed in, and worshipped as his God. And this his interest in him, and relation to him, he uses with great pertinence and propriety, as an argument that he might be heard by him; since the Lord was his King, and he his subject; the Lord was his God, and he one of his people; the Lord was his father, and he a child of his; and therefore entreats and hopes to be heard; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>. His next argument is taken from his resolution to pray to him, and to continue to do so: <p>for unto thee will I pray; and only to thee: not to the gods of the Heathen, to idols, the works of men's hands, who can neither hear nor save: and to thee always; suggesting, that he would never leave off praying till he was heard; he would give him no rest, day nor night, until he received an answer. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">my cry</span>] A word specially used of an imploring cry to God for help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-24.htm" title="For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither has he hid his face from him; but when he cried to him, he heard.">Psalm 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm" title="Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry to you, when I lift up my hands toward your holy oracle.">Psalm 28:2</a>; &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my King, and my God</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm" title="Yes, the sparrow has found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.">Psalm 84:3</a>.

The lxx has rendered it correctly: &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>): if ye will be angry beware of sinning, viz., backbiting and rebellion (cf. the similar paratactic combinations <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>). In connection with the rendering contremiscite we feel to miss any expression of that before which they are to tremble (viz., the sure punishment which God decrees). He warns his adversaries against blind passion, and counsels them to quiet converse with their own hearts, and solitary meditation, in order that they may not imperil their own salvation. To commune with one's own heart, without the addition of the object, is equivalent to to think alone by one's self, and the bed or resting-place, without requiring to be understood literally, points to a condition of mind that is favourable to quiet contemplation. The heart is the seat of the conscience, and the Spirit of God (as Hamann, Werke i. 98, observes on this subject) disguises itself as our own voice that we may see His exhortation, His counsel, and His wisdom well up out of our own stony heart. The second imper. continues the first: and cease, prop. be still (&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; from the sound of the closed mouth checking the discourse), i.e., come to your right mind by self-examination, cease your tumult-a warning coming with the semblance of command by reason of the consciousness of innocence on his part; and this impression has to be rendered here by the striking in of the music. The dehortation passes over into exhortation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>. Of course the sacrifices were continued in the sanctuary while David, with his faithful followers, was a fugitive from Jerusalem. Referring to this, David cries out to the Absolomites: offer &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;. Here at least these are not offerings consisting of actions which are in accordance with the will of God, instead of slaughtered animals, but sacrifices offered with a right mind, conformed to the will of God, instead of the hypocritical mind with which they consecrate their evil doings and think to flatter God. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-21.htm">Psalm 51:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a> also, "the sacrifices of righteousness" are real sacrifices, not merely symbols of moral acts. Not less full of meaning is the exhortation &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; is construed with &#1488;&#1500; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-4.htm">Psalm 56:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>, combining with the notion of trusting that of drawing near to, hanging on, attaching one's self to any one. The Arabic word bt&#803;h&#803;, expandere, has preserved the primary notion of the word, a notion which, as in the synon. Arab. bst&#803;, when referred to the effect which is produced on the heart, countenance and whole nature of the man by a joyous cheerful state of mind, passes over to the notion of this state of mind itself, so that &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; (like the Arab. inbasat&#803;a to be cheerful, fearless, bold, lit., expanded [cf. &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>]  equals  unstraitened) consequently signifies to be courageous, confident. They are to renounce the self-trust which blinds them in their opposition to the king who is deprived of all human assistance. If they will trustingly submit themselves to God, then at the same time the murmuring and rancorous discontent, from which the rebellion has sprung, will be stilled. Thus far the address to the rebellious magnates goes. </body></html>
