The mercy of God should ever be the foundation both of our hope and of our joy, in every thing wherein we have to do with him. Let us learn to pray, not for ourselves only, but for others; grace be with all that love Christ in sincerity. The Divine blessing comes down upon us through Jesus Christ, the righteous or just One, as of old it did upon Israel through David, whom God protected, and placed upon the throne. Thou, O Christ, art the righteous Saviour, thou art the King of Israel, thou art the Fountain of blessing to all believers; thy favour is the defence and protection of thy church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But as for me - While it is their characteristic that they are wicked, and have no desire to serve God; and while with such characteristics they can have no hope of access to God, and no reason to suppose that he will hear their cry, I am inclined to enter his house, and I feel the assurance that he will listen to my prayer. In character and ill feelings he was wholly unlike them.<p>I will come into thy house - Indicating his expectation and his hope that he would yet be permitted to enter the courts of the Lord, from which he was now driven away (see the introduction to the psalm), and his purpose thus to acknowledge God. The word "house" here refers to the tabernacle, which was regarded as the house or dwelling place of God. The word was applied to the entire structure, embracing all the courts, as being sacred to God, as the word was subsequently to the whole of the temple. It was the holy of holies, however, which was regarded as the special dwelling-place of God, and that none were permitted to enter but the high priest, and he but once in the year. (See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-1.htm">Hebrews 9:1-7</a>.)<p>In the multitude of thy mercy - In thine abundant mercy. He expected to be delivered from his present troubles, and he felt assured that God would permit him again to enter his earthly courts, and to offer his vows and thanksgivings there.<p>And in thy fear - In profound reverence for thee. Fear, or reverence, is often employed to denote devotion or worship.<p>Will I worship toward thy holy temple - The worshippers were not permitted to enter the temple, but worshipped "toward" it; that is, looking toward it, or prostrating themselves toward it as the special dwelling-place of God. If they were in the courts around the temple, they worshipped with their faces toward the place where God was supposed to reside; if they were far away, even in distant lands, they still directed their faces toward Jerusalem and the temple, as the Muslims now do toward Mecca. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>. It has been objected, from the use of the word "temple" here, that this psalm could not have been written by David, as the temple was not built until the time of Solomon. But in reply to this it may be observed that the word here used - &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;  he&#770;yka&#770;l - is a word of large signification, and might be applied to any place of worship. It means, properly, a large and magnificent building, a palace, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-28.htm">Proverbs 30:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>; and then, the place where Yahweh was supposed to reside, or the place of his worship; and might be applied to the tabernacle as well as to the temple. In fact, it is "often" applied to the tabernacle that was in use before the building of the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-7.htm">2 Samuel 22:7</a>.

The Psalmist has bent his knee in prayer: he has described before God, as an argument for his deliverance, the character and the fate of the wicked; and now he contrasts this with the condition of the righteous. "But as for me, I will come into thy house." I will not stand at a distance, I will come into thy sanctuary, just as a child comes into his father's house. But I will not come there by my own merits; no, I have a multitude of sins, and therefore I will come in the multitude of thy mercy. I will approach thee with confidence because of thy immeasurable grace. God's judgments are all numbered, but his mercies are innumerable; he gives his wrath by weight, but without weight his mercy. "And in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple," - towards the temple of thy holiness. The temple was not built on earth at that time; it was but a tabernacle; but David was wont to turn his eyes spiritually to that temple of God's holiness where between the wings of the Cherubim Jehovah dwells in light ineffable. Daniel opened his window towards Jerusalem, but we open our hearts towards heaven. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will come, </span> to wit, with holy boldness and confidence, as becomes thy son and servant; whereas mine enemies cannot appear in thy presence with any comfort and safety, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-5.htm" title="The foolish shall not stand in your sight: you hate all workers of iniquity.">Psalm 5:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Into thy house, </span> to wit, the tabernacle; from which, though I be now excluded, through the malice and power of mine adversaries, yet thou wilt, I doubt not, restore me to my former opportunities of coming thither to worship thee, which was my constant custom and chief joy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the multitude of thy mercy, </span> or, <span class="ital">by thy great mercy</span>, i.e. trusting only to thy great mercy for admittance thither, and acceptance there.

The tabernacle of Moses, sometimes called the house of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-23.htm">1 Chronicles 9:23</a>; for as yet the temple was not built. Here David had been used to go in times past; and though he was now in a kind of exile from it, he was confident he should again enter into and determined so to do whenever he had an opportunity, and that in the following manner: <p>in the multitude of thy mercy; grace or goodness. God is rich in mercy, abundant in goodness and truth; there is a multitude of mercy, love, and grace in his heart, and which is stored up in his covenant, and displayed in his Son, and in the provision of him as a Saviour of lost sinners; abundant mercy is shown in regeneration, in adoption, and in the forgiveness of sins, and in every spiritual blessing, and in the gift of eternal life. And now, not relying on his own merits, strength, and righteousness, or leaning to his own understanding, but trusting in the mercy, grace, and goodness of God in Christ, and in hope of finding more grace and mercy to help in time of need; with thankfulness for what he had received, he determines, by divine leave and assistance, to enter, into the house of the Lord: and whatever other persons did, whom he had before described, it was his resolution to serve the Lord, under a sense of his mercy and goodness to him; which laid him under an obligation so to do, and is the true principle from which all service should proceed; <p>and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple; either heaven, the habitation of God's holiness, towards which, and to God there, the psalmist would lift up his eyes, his hands, and heart; or the tabernacle, at the door of which the worship of God was performed, the sacrifices were brought, and God met his people; and therefore he says he would worship towards the temple or tabernacle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>. And it may be that David has reference to the Messiah, the medium of divine worship; whose human nature was typified by the tabernacle and temple, in which the fulness of the Godhead dwells: the psalmist therefore purposes to worship God in Christ, and to perform all acts of worship, as prayer, praise, hearing the word, offering sacrifice, &amp;c. in the name and faith of Christ; looking towards him for the presentation of his services by him, and for the acceptance of them with God through him: and this he desired to do in the "fear" of God; not with a slavish fear, but with reverence and godly fear; with a fear influenced by the multitude of God's mercy, grace, and goodness, in art humble modest manner, not trusting to, or depending upon, any service done by him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But as for me, I <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> will come <i>into</i> thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: <i>and</i> in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</span><p>(e) In the deepest of his temptations he puts his full confidence in God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">I will come</span> &c.] Better, as R.V., following the order of the original: in the multitude [or, <span class="ital">abundance</span>] of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house.

Beginning thus the prayer gradually rises to a vox clamoris. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;, to be distinguished from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (inf. Pi.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>, is one word with the Aram. &#1510;&#1493;&#1495;, Aethiop. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (to call).

The invocation &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, when it is a king who utters it, is all the more significant. David, and in general the theocratic king, is only the representative of the Invisible One, whom he with all Israel adores as his King. Prayer to Him is his first work as he begins the day. In the morning, &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-8.htm">Psalm 65:8</a> for &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-13.htm">Psalm 88:13</a>), shalt Thou hear my cry, is equivalent to my cry which goes forth with the early morn. Hupfeld considers the mention of the morning as only a "poetical expression" and when getting rid of the meaning prima luce, he also gets rid of the beautiful and obvious reference to the daily sacrifice. The verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1498; is the word used of laying the wood in order for the sacrifice, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>, and the pieces of the sacrifice, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-12.htm">Leviticus 1:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>, of putting the sacred lamps in order, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-3.htm">Leviticus 24:3</a>., and of setting the shew-bread in order, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>.

The morning prayer is compared to this morning sacrifice. This is in its way also a sacrifice. The object which David has in his mind in connection with &#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; is &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;. As the priests, with the early morning, lay the wood and pieces of the sacrifices of the Tam&#305;&#770;d upon the altar, so he brings his prayer before God as a spiritual sacrifice and looks out for an answer (&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; speculari as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), perhaps as the priest looks out for fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice, or looks to the smoke to see that it rises up straight towards heaven. </body></html>
