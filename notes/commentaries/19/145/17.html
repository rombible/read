In all his acts of government he is just, injurious to none, but administering justice to all: his ways are equal, though ours are unequal.

He satisfies the desire of every living thing, except the unreasonable children of men, who are satisfied with nothing. He does good to all the children of men; his own people in a special manner. Many children of God, who have been ready to fall into sin, to fall into despair, have tasted his goodness in preventing their falls, or recovering them speedily by his graces and comforts. And with respect to all that are heavy laden under the burden of sin, if they come to Christ by faith, he will ease them, he will raise them. He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of his people. He is present every where; but in a special way he is nigh to them, as he is not to others. He is in their hearts, and dwells there by faith, and they dwell in him. He is nigh to those that call upon him, to help them in all times of need. He will be nigh to them, that they may have what they ask, and find what they seek, if they call upon him in truth and sincerity. And having taught men to love his name and holy ways, he will save them from the destruction of the wicked. May we then love his name, and walk in his ways, while we desire that all flesh should bless his holy name for ever and ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/145.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is righteous in all his ways - In his own character; in his laws; in his providential dealings; in his arrangements for the redemption and salvation of man. In his own character he is what it is desirable that a God should be; in all his laws he ordains that only which it is desirable should be enacted; in all his dealings with people he does that which it is desirable should be done. He violates no right; he wrongs no one; he demands of no one a service which would be unjust; he makes no arrangements for pardon and salvation which it is not best should be made. It is much for a man to be able to say in all that occurs to him under the divine administration, "It is right;" it is much for a man to have such confidence in God as to be able to feel that all he does in respect to nations is the best thing that could be done.

The Hebrew word is merciful. The idea seems to be that righteousness and mercy are equally consulted in his arrangements; that they meet together, and act harmomoniously in the divine plans.

His ways and works are both worthy to be praised. Jehovah cannot be unjust or impure. Let his doings be what they may, they are in every case righteous and holy. This is the confession of the godly who follow his ways, and of the gracious who study his works. Whatever God is or does must be right. In the salvation of his people he is as righteous and holy as in any other of his ways and works: he has not manifested mercy at the expense of justice, but the rather he has magnified his righteousness by the death of his Son.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a><p>"The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him." Not only near by his omnipresence, but to sympathize and favour. He does not leave praying men, and men who confess his name, to battle with the world alone, but he is ever at their side. This favour is not for a few of those who invoke him; but for each one of the pious company. "All" who place themselves beneath the shield of his glorious name by calling themselves by it, and by calling upon it in supplication, shall find him to be a very present help in trouble. "To all that call upon him in truth'" for there are many whose formal prayers and false professions will never bring them into communion with the Lord. To pray in truth, we must have a true heart, and the truth in our heart; and then we must be humble, for pride is a falsehood; and be earnest, or else prayer is a lie. A God of truth cannot be nigh to the spirit of hypocrisy; this he knows and hates; neither can he be far removed from a sincere spirit, since it is his work, and he forsakes not the work of his own hands.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-19.htm">Psalm 145:19</a><p>"He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him" that is, those who reverence his name and his law. Inasmuch as they have respect unto his will, he will have respect unto their will. They shall have their way for they have his way in their hearts. A holy heart only desires what a holy God can give, and so its desire is filled full out of the fulness of the Lord. "He also will hear their cry, and will save them." Divinely practical shall his nearness be, for he will work their deliverance. He will listen to their piteous cry, and then will send salvation from every ill. This he will do himself personally; he will not trust them to angels or saints.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-20.htm">Psalm 145:20</a><p>"The Lord preserveth all them that love him." They keep him in their love, and he keeps them by his love. See how these favoured ones have advanced from fearing the Lord and crying to him, even to loving him, and in that love they are secure from all danger. Mark the number of "alls" in these later verses of the Psalm. In each of these God is all in all. "But all the wicked will he destroy." Wickedness is an offence to all holy beings, and therefore those who are determined to continue in it must be weeded out. As good sanitary laws remove all creators of pest and plague, so does the moral government of God mark every evil thing for destruction; it cannot be tolerated in the presence of a perfectly holy God. What ruins wicked men frequently become in this life! What monuments of wrath will they be in the world to come! Like Nineveh and Babylon, and other destroyed places, they shall only exist to declare how thoroughly God fulfils his threatenings.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/145.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Holy; </span> or rather, merciful, as this word most commonly signifies.

Christ is righteous in all the ways of providence, in which he is jointly concerned with his Father: there are some of the ways of providence, which are now intricate and perplexed, are unsearchable and past finding out, and cannot be easily reconciled to the justice and faithfulness of God, respecting the prosperity of the wicked and the afflictions of the righteous; but these will before long be made manifest, and they will appear to be just and true. And so in all his ways of grace, in all his decrees; in the choice of some to everlasting life, and the leaving of others; with respect to either of these, there is no unrighteousness in him: nor in the redemption of men, for which an adequate price is given; and in which mercy and truth, righteousness and peace, meet together; nor in the justification of a sinner, which is not done without a righteousness, but in such manner that God is just while he is the justifier of him that believes in Jesus; nor in the pardon of sin, which is upon the foot of a satisfaction made to the justice of God, by the blood and sacrifice of Christ; nor in eternal life, the gift of God through Christ, which none inherit but righteous ones. Christ is righteous in all his suretyship engagements, which he has punctually performed, and in the execution of all his offices; in doing which, righteousness and faithfulness are the girdle of his loins and reins: and so likewise he is and will appear righteous in his judgments on his and his people's enemies, in the destruction of antichrist and his followers. And, moreover, he is righteous in all the ways he prescribes for his people to walk in, in all his commandments and ordinances; which are all holy, just, and good; <p>and holy in all his works; in all his works of providence; doing no evil, though he suffers it for wise ends, and overrules it for good: and in all his works of grace; in election, which is through holiness and to it; in the redemption of his people, which is from a vain conversation, and that they might be a peculiar people, zealous of good works; in the calling of them with an holy calling, and to holiness; in bringing them to glory, which is through regeneration and sanctification.

Instead of &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491; the expression here, however, is &#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (Ker&#1502;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a>, with Makkeph &#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500;&#1470;). The real will of God tends towards favour, which gladly giving stoops to give (&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;), and towards compassion, which interests itself on behalf of the sinner for his help and comfort (&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). Wrath is only the background of His nature, which He reluctantly and only after long waiting (&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;) lets loose against those who spurn His great mercy. For His goodness embraces, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a> says, all; His tender mercies are over all His works, they hover over and encompass all His creatures. Therefore, too, all His works praise Him: they are all together loud-speaking witnesses of that sympathetic all-embracing love of His, which excludes no one who does not exclude himself; and His saints, who live in God's love, bless Him (&#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; written as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-44.htm">1 Kings 18:44</a>): their mouth overflows with the declaration (&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) of the glory of the kingdom of this loving God, and in speaking (&#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) of the sovereign power with which He maintains and extends this kingdom. This confession they make their employ, in order that the knowledge of the mighty acts of God and the glorious majesty of His kingdom may at length become the general possession of mankind. When the poet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-12.htm">Psalm 145:12</a> sets forth the purpose of the proclamation, he drops the form of address. God's kingdom is a kingdom of all aeons, and His dominion is manifested without exception and continually in all periods or generations (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1512; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-18.htm">Psalm 45:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-28.htm">Esther 9:28</a>, a pleonastic strengthening of the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>). It is the eternal circumference of the history of time, but at the same time its eternal substance, which more and more unfolds and achieves itself in the succession of the periods that mark its course. For that all things in heaven and on earth shall be gathered up together (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>) in the all-embracing kingdom of God in His Christ, is the goal of all history, and therefore the substance of history which is working itself out. With <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a> (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-33.htm">Daniel 3:33</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31</a>, according to Hitzig the primary passages) another paragraph is brought to a close. </body></html>
