He satisfies the desire of every living thing, except the unreasonable children of men, who are satisfied with nothing. He does good to all the children of men; his own people in a special manner. Many children of God, who have been ready to fall into sin, to fall into despair, have tasted his goodness in preventing their falls, or recovering them speedily by his graces and comforts. And with respect to all that are heavy laden under the burden of sin, if they come to Christ by faith, he will ease them, he will raise them. He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of his people. He is present every where; but in a special way he is nigh to them, as he is not to others. He is in their hearts, and dwells there by faith, and they dwell in him. He is nigh to those that call upon him, to help them in all times of need. He will be nigh to them, that they may have what they ask, and find what they seek, if they call upon him in truth and sincerity. And having taught men to love his name and holy ways, he will save them from the destruction of the wicked. May we then love his name, and walk in his ways, while we desire that all flesh should bless his holy name for ever and ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/145.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord - That is, I will utter his praise. In view of all these things, in view of his character and doings, I will praise him. I will be found among those who honor him; who acknowledge him as the true God; who render homage for what he is, and thanks for what he has done.<p>And let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever - All people; all that dwell upon the earth. Let his praise be universal and eternal. This is the language of true piety; all in whose bosom there is any true religion will heartily say Amen. No desire of a pious heart is more constant and strong than that God should be praised, adored, honored by all intelligent creatures; that he should be known and acknowledged in all the earth as the true God; that his praise should ascend from all parts of the universe forever.

The words with &#1500; are pure datives, cf. the accusative expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>. He in person is the support which holds fast the falling ones (&#1504;&#1493;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, here not the fallen ones, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>) in the midst of falling (Nicephorus: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;), and the stay by which those who are bowed together raise themselves. He is the Provider for all beings, the Father of the house, to whom in the great house of the world the eyes (&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; with the second e&#770; toneless, Ew. 100, b) of all beings, endowed with reason and irrational, are directed with calm confidence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>), and who gives them their food in its, i.e., in due season. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27</a> is very similar, and it proceeds here, too, as there in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-28.htm">Psalm 104:28</a> (cf. Sir. 40:14). He opens His hand, which is ever full, much as a man who feeds the doves in his court does, and gives &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, pleasure, i.e., that which is good, which is the fulfilling of their desire, in sufficient fulness to all living things (and therefore those in need of support for the body and the life). Thus it is to be interpreted, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a> (after which here in the lxx the reading varies between &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; and &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;), cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; is construed with a dative and accusative of the object instead of with two accusatives of the object (Ges. 139. 1, 2). The usage of the language is unacquainted with &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; as an adverb in the sense of "willingly" (Hitzig), which would rather be &#1489;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498;. In all the ways that Jahve takes in His historical rule He is "righteous," i.e., He keeps strictly to the rule (norm) of His holy love; and in all His works which He accomplishes in the course of history He is merciful (&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;), i.e., He practises mercy (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>); for during the present time of mercy the primary essence of His active manifestation is free preventing mercy, condescending love. True, He remains at a distance from the hypocrites, just as their heart remains far from Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>); but as for the rest, with impartial equality He is nigh (&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>) to all who call upon Him &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, in firmness, certainty, truth, i.e., so that the prayer comes from their heart and is holy fervour (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>). What is meant is true and real prayer in opposition to the &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, as is also meant in the main in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23</a>. To such true praying ones Jahve is present, viz., in mercy (for in respect of His power He is everywhere); He makes the desire of those who fear Him a reality, their will being also His; and He grants them the salvation (&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;) prayed for. Those who are called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-19.htm">Psalm 145:19</a> those who fear Him, are called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-20.htm">Psalm 145:20</a> those who love Him. Fear and love of God belong inseparably together; for fear without love is an unfree, servile disposition, and love without fear, bold-faced familiarity: the one dishonours the all-gracious One, and the other the all-exalted One. But all who love and fear Him He preserves, and on the other hand exterminates all wanton sinners. Having reached the Tav, the hymn of praise, which has traversed all the elements of the language, is at an end. The poet does not, however, close without saying that praising God shall be his everlasting employment (&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; with Olewejored, the Mahpach or rather Jethib sign of which above represents the Makkeph), and without wishing that all flesh, i.e., all men, who &#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;&#x3be; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1501;, may bless God's holy Name to all eternity. The realization of this wish is the final goal of history. It will then have reached <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a> of the great song in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a> - Jahve one and His Name one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>), Israel praising God &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, and the Gentiles &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>.). </body></html>
