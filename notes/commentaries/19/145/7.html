Especially we should speak of God's wondrous work of redemption, while we declare his greatness. For no deliverance of the Israelites, nor the punishment of sinners, so clearly proclaims the justice of God, as the cross of Christ exhibits it to the enlightened mind. It may be truly said of our Lord Jesus Christ, that his words are words of goodness and grace; his works are works of goodness and grace. He is full of compassion; hence he came into the world to save sinners. When on earth, he showed his compassion both to the bodies and souls of men, by healing the one, and making wise the other. He is of great mercy, a merciful High Priest, through whom God is merciful to sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/145.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness - Hebrew, The memory of the greatness of thy goodness they will pour forth. The word rendered "abundantly utter" means to bud forth, to gush out, to flow, as a fountain. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-4.htm">Proverbs 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>. It is applied to words as poured forth in praise. The meaning is, that the heart is full, as a fountain is full of water, and that it naturally overflows, or seeks to discharge itself. The thought of the goodness of God fills the heart, and makes it overflow with gratitude.<p>And shall sing of thy righteousness - They shall shout for joy at the displays of thy justice; at the manifestations of thy righteous character. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/145.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. memory&#8212;(Ps 6:5), remembrance, or what causes to be remembered.<p>righteousness&#8212;as in Ps 143:1, goodness according to covenant engagement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/145.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The memory of thy great goodness; </span> the memorials of thy kindness to thy people, thy never to be forgotten blessings. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/145.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,.... Not only his essential goodness, or the perfections of his nature; nor his providential goodness only; but his special grace and goodness to his own people in becoming their surety, in assuming their nature, in laying down his life for them, in working out their salvation, in paying their debts, and providing for them food and raiment, and all things pertaining to life and godliness: which goodness is "great", inexpressibly great, and passing knowledge; if we consider the spring of it, his good will and free favour, and not the works and merits of men; the multitude of persons it reaches to, all the elect of God, a number which no man can number, out of every people and nation; and the many benefits bestowed on them through it, all the blessings of goodness he himself is prevented with, even all spiritual blessings that are in him. Now this will be remembered by the saints, and not forgotten; in "the memory" of which they are assisted by the Spirit of God, who brings this goodness to their remembrance; and under the Gospel dispensation an ordinance is appointed to refresh the memory of the saints with it; and with such helps they are enabled at times "abundantly" to "utter" it, or to speak of it in a very free and flowing manner; it comes from them like water from a flowing fountain, as the word (c) signifies; out of the abundance of their hearts, and the great sense they have of his goodness, their mouth speaketh; <p>and shall sing of thy righteousness; his essential righteousness as God, the same with his divine Father's; his righteousness as Mediator, or his righteous and faithful performance of his office, as such; and his justifying righteousness, which he undertook to work out and bring in: and those that know it, and have an interest in it, have great reason to sing, because it is commensurate to the demands of law and justice; and so large a robe of righteousness as to enwrap and cover all their persons, and justify them from all things; and because it is so beautiful, rich, and glorious, and makes them appear so; and because it is so well-pleasing to God, and so comfortable and beneficial to them; securing them from wrath, and entitling them to eternal life. Aben Ezra adds the word "saying", as if what follows was, the subject matter of the song. <p>(c) "eructabunt", Montanus, Piscator; "scaturient", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/145.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/145.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">They shall abundantly utter</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">pour forth</span> as a perpetual stream of praise, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-171.htm" title="My lips shall utter praise, when you have taught me your statutes.">Psalm 119:171</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy great goodness</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-19.htm" title="Oh how great is your goodness, which you have laid up for them that fear you; which you have worked for them that trust in you before the sons of men!">Psalm 31:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm" title="I will mention the loving kindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.">Isaiah 63:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall</span> joyfully sing <span class="ital">of thy righteousness</span>] i.e. God’s faithfulness to His revealed character.

We are reminded of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2</a>, and the likewise alphabetical song of praise and thanksgiving <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a>. The plena scriptio &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-6.htm">Psalm 98:6</a>. The language of address "my God the King," which sounds harsh in comparison with the otherwise usual "my King and my God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-4.htm">Psalm 84:4</a>), purposely calls God with unrelated generality, that is to say in the most absolute manner, the King. If the poet is himself a king, the occasion for this appellation of God is all the more natural and the signification all the more pertinent. But even in the mouth of any other person it is significant. Whosoever calls God by such a name acknowledges His royal prerogative, and at the same time does homage to Him and binds himself to allegiance; and it is just this confessory act of exalting Him who in Himself is the absolutely lofty One that is here called &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;. But who can the poet express the purpose of praising God's Name for ever? Because the praise of God is a need of his inmost nature, he has a perfect right to forget his own mortality when engaged upon this devotion to the ever-living King. Clinging adoringly to the Eternal One, he must seem to himself to be eternal; and if there is a practical proof for a life after death, it is just this ardent desire of the soul, wrought of God Himself, after the praise of the God of its life (lit., its origin) which affords it the highest, noblest delight. The idea of the silent Hades, which forces itself forward elsewhere, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>, where the mind of the poet is beclouded by sin, is here entirely removed, inasmuch as here the mind of the poet is the undimmed mirror of the divine glory. Therefore <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-2.htm">Psalm 145:2</a> also does not concede the possibility of any interruption of the praise: the poet will daily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>) bless God, be they days of prosperity or of sorrow, uninterruptedly in all eternity will he glorify His Name (&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-31.htm">Psalm 69:31</a>). There is no worthier and more exhaustless object of praise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>): Jahve is great, and greatly to be praised (&#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/96-4.htm">Psalm 96:4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>), and of His "greatness" (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a>, where this attribute precedes all others) there is no searching out, i.e., it is so abysmally deep that no searching can reach its bottom (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>.). It has, however, been revealed, and is being revealed continually, and is for this very reason thus celebrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a> : one generation propagates to the next the growing praise of the works that He has wrought out (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;), and men are able to relate all manner of proofs of His victorious power which prevails over everything, and makes everything subject to itself (&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, and frequently). This historically manifest and traditional divine doxa and the facts (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>) of the divine wonders the poet will devoutly consider. &#1492;&#1491;&#1512; stands in attributive relation to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, as this on its part does to &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1498;. Thy brilliantly gloriously (kingly) majesty (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>). The poet does not say &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, nor may we insert it, either here in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-6.htm">Psalm 145:6</a>, where the same sequence of thoughts recurs, more briefly expressed. The emphasis lies on the objects. The mightiness (&#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>, where it signifies violence) of His terrible acts shall pass from mouth to mouth (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; with a substantival object as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>), and His mighty acts (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, magnalia, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>) - according to the Ker (which is determined by the suffix of &#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;; cf. however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-23.htm">2 Samuel 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-3.htm">2 Kings 3:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26</a>, and frequently): His greatness (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) - will he also on his part make the matter of his narrating. It is, however, not alone the awe-inspiring majesty of God which is revealed in history, but also the greatness (&#1512;&#1489; used as a substantive as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>, whereas &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a> is an adjective placed before the noun after the manner of a numeral), i.e., the abundant measure, of His goodness and His righteousness, i.e., His acting in inviolable correspondence with His counsel and order of salvation. The memory of the transcendent goodness of God is the object of universal, overflowing acknowledgement and the righteousness of God is the object of universal exultation (&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503; with the accusative as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-17.htm">Psalm 59:17</a>). After the poet has sung the glorious self-attestation of God according to both its sides, the fiery and the light sides, he lingers by the light side, the front side of the Name of Jahve unfolded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. </body></html>
