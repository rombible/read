First, such as declare his glory, and excite our admiration whenever we behold them. Of this sort are the shining frame of the heavens, and all the bodies which move therein; the earth, with its furniture without, and its contents within; the magnificent and stupendous ocean which flows around; the different tribes of animals inhabiting both the one and the other; and above all, the construction of man, the lord of this lower world. Under the second class of God’s works are ranged all those which the psalmist styles his <span class="ital">terrible acts, </span>or the exertions of his power against his enemies; such as the destruction of the old world by water; of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire; of Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea; of the Canaanitish nations by the sword; and the victory gained over sin and death by the resurrection of Christ. In the third rank stand those works which have proceeded from the <span class="ital">goodness </span>of God, and his <span class="ital">righteousness, </span>in the performance of his promises. And among these we may reckon all the different species of provision which have been made by providence, for the bodies of men in the world, and by grace for their souls in the church. On any of these subjects meditation cannot be long employed, without breaking forth into wonder, gratitude, and praise.” — Horne.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/145.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>145:1-9 Those who, under troubles and temptations, abound in fervent prayer, shall in due season abound in grateful praise, which is the true language of holy joy. Especially we should speak of God's wondrous work of redemption, while we declare his greatness. For no deliverance of the Israelites, nor the punishment of sinners, so clearly proclaims the justice of God, as the cross of Christ exhibits it to the enlightened mind. It may be truly said of our Lord Jesus Christ, that his words are words of goodness and grace; his works are works of goodness and grace. He is full of compassion; hence he came into the world to save sinners. When on earth, he showed his compassion both to the bodies and souls of men, by healing the one, and making wise the other. He is of great mercy, a merciful High Priest, through whom God is merciful to sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/145.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will speak - That is, in my acts of praise.

The union becomes satisfactorily close in connection with this reading, but the reference of the description, so designedly set forth, to the enemies is improbable. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/144-12.htm">Psalm 144:12-14</a> we hear a language that is altogether peculiar, without any assignable earlier model. Instead of &#1504;&#1496;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; we read &#1504;&#1496;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; elsewhere; "in their youth" belongs to "our sons." &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, our garners or treasuries, from a singular &#1502;&#1494;&#1493; or &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (apparently from a verb &#1502;&#1494;&#1492;, but contracted out of &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1492;), is a hapaxlegomenon; the older language has the words &#1488;&#1505;&#1501;, &#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;, &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; instead of it. In like manner &#1494;&#1503;, genus (vid., Ewald, Lehrbuch, S. 380), is a later word (found besides only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>, where &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; signifies et varia quidem, Syriac zenonoje, or directly spices from species); the older language has miyn for this word. Instead of &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, kine, which signifies "princes" in the older language, the older language says &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-8.htm">Psalm 8:8</a>. The plena scriptio &#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, in which the Waw is even inaccurate, corresponds to the later period; and to this corresponds &#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/144-15.htm">Psalm 144:15</a>, cf. on the other hand <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a>. Also &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, laden  equals  bearing, like the Latin forda from ferre (cf. &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-10.htm">Job 21:10</a>), is not found elsewhere. &#1510;&#1488;&#1503; is (contrary to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-39.htm">Genesis 30:39</a>) treated as a feminine collective, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-10.htm">Job 21:10</a>) as a nomen epicaenum. Contrary to the usage of the word, Maurer, K&#1510;ster, Von Lengerke, and F&#1516;rst render it: our princes are set up (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3</a>); also, after the mention of animals of the fold upon the meadows out-of-doors, one does not expect the mention of princes, but of horned cattle that are to be found in the stalls.<p>&#1494;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514; elsewhere signifies a corner, and here, according to the prevailing view, the corner-pillars; so that the elegant slender daughters are likened to tastefully sculptured Caryatides - not to sculptured projections (Luther). For (1) &#1494;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514; does not signify a projection, but a corner, an angle, Arabic Arab. za&#770;wyt, za&#770;wia (in the terminology of the stone-mason the square-stone  equals  &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, in the terminology of the carpenter the square), from Arab. zwa&#770;, abdere (cf. e.g., the proverb: f&#305;&#770;'l zawa&#770;ja&#770; chaba&#770;ja&#770;, in the corners are treasures). (2) The upstanding pillar is better adapted to the comparison than the overhanging projection. But that other prevailing interpretation is also doubtful. The architecture of Syria and Palestine - the ancient, so far as it can be known to us from its remains, and the new - exhibits nothing in connection with which one would be led to think of "corner-pillars." Nor is there any trace of that signification to be found in the Semitic &#1494;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;. On the other hand, the corners of large rooms in the houses of persons of position are ornamented with carved work even in the present day, and since this ornamentation is variegated, it may be asked whether &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; does here signify "sculptured," and not rather "striped in colours, variegated," which we prefer, since &#1495;&#1496;&#1489; (cogn. &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;) signifies nothing more than to hew firewood;<p>(Note: In every instance where &#1495;&#1496;&#1489; (cogn. &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;) occurs, frequently side by side with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1489; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (to draw water), it signifies to hew wood for kindling; wherefore in Arabic, in which the verb has been lost, Arab. h&#803;at&#803;ab signifies firewood (in distinction from Arab. chs&#780;b, wood for building, timber), and not merely this, but fuel in the widest sense, e.g., in villages where wood is scarce, cow-dung (vid., Job, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-6.htm">Job 20:6-11</a>, note), and the hemp-stalk, or stalk of the maize, in the desert the Arab. b&#8219;rt, i.e., camel-dung (which blazes up with a blue flame), and the perennial steppe-plant or its root. In relation to Arab. h&#803;at&#803;ab, ah&#803;t&#803;b signifies lopped, pruned, robbed of its branches (of a tree), and Arab. h&#803;rb h&#803;a&#770;tb a pruning war, which devastates a country, just as the wood-gathering women of a settlement (styled Arab. 'l-h&#803;a&#770;t&#780;ba&#770;t or 'l-h&#780;wa&#770;t&#803;t) with their small hatchet (Arab. mih&#803;t&#803;ab) lay a district covered with tall plants bare in a few days. In the villages of the Merg' the little girls who collect the dry cow-dung upon the pastures are called Arab. bna&#770;t h&#803;a&#770;t&#803;ba&#770;t, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1496;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;. - Wetzstein.)<p>and on the other side, the signification of the Arabic chat&#803;iba, to be striped, many-coloured (IV to become green-striped, of the coloquintida), is also secured to the verb &#1495;&#1496;&#1489; side by side with that signification by <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>. It is therefore to be rendered: our daughters are as corners adorned in varied colours after the architecture of palaces.<p>(Note: Corners with variegated carved work are found even in the present day in Damascus in every reception-room (the so-called Arab. qa&#770;&#8219;t) or respectable houses cf. Lane, Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians, Introduction). An architectural ornament composed with much good taste and laborious art out of wood carvings, and glittering with gold and brilliant colours, covers the upper part of the corners, of which a k&#803;a&#770;&#8219;a may have as many as sixteen, since three wings frequently abut upon the be&#770;t el-bah&#803;a&#780;ra, i.e., the square with its marble basin. This decoration, which has a most pleasing effect to the eye, is a great advantage to saloons from two to three storeys high, and is evidently designed to get rid of the darker corners above on the ceiling, comes down from the ceiling in the corners of the room for the length of six to nine feet, gradually becoming narrower as it descends. It is the broadest above, so that it there also covers the ends of the horizontal corners formed by the walls and the ceiling. If this crowning of the corners, the technical designation of which, if I remember rightly, is Arab. 'l-qrnyt, k&#803;orn&#305;&#770;a, might be said to go back into Biblical antiquity, the Psalmist would have used it as a simile to mark the beauty, gorgeous dress, and rich adornment of women. Perhaps, too, because they are not only modest and chaste (cf. Arabic mestura&#770;t, a veiled woman, in opposition to memshusha&#770;t, one shone on by the sun), but also, like the children of respectable families, hidden from the eyes of strangers; for the Arabic proverb quoted above says, "treasures are hidden in the corners," and the superscription of a letter addressed to a lady of position runs: "May it kiss the hand of the protected lady and of the hidden jewel." - Wetzstein.)<p>The words &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1507;, to bring forth by thousands, and &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1489; (denominative from &#1512;&#1489;&#1489;&#1492;), which surpasses it, multiplied by tens of thousands, are freely formed. Concerning &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, meadows, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-17.htm">Job 18:17</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, in a martial sense a defeat, clades, e.g., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-15.htm">Judges 21:15</a>, is here any violent misfortune whatever, as murrain, which causes a breach, and &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514; any head of cattle which goes off by a single misfortune. The lamentation in the streets is intended as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; is also found in Sol 5:9; nor does the poet, however, hesitate to blend this &#1513;&#1473; with the tetragrammaton into one word. The Jod is not dageshed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-2.htm">Psalm 123:2</a>), because it is to be read &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, cf. &#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>. Luther takes <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-15.htm">Psalm 144:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-15.htm">Psalm 144:15</a> as contrasts: Blessed is the people that is in such a case, But blessed is the people whose God is the Lord. There is, however, no antithesis intended, but only an exceeding of the first declaration by the second. For to be allowed to call the God from whom every blessing comes his God, is still infinitely more than the richest abundance of material blessing. The pinnacle of Israel's good fortune consists in being, by the election of grace, the people of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a>). </body></html>
