But these arguments can hardly weigh against the improbability that, in an artificial composition, one letter (and that an easy one for the purpose) should have been either purposely or accidentally omitted in the original draft, especially when we reflect how extremely unlikely it was that the LXX. should trouble themselves to supply a verse in order to keep up an arrangement of which they took no other notice, perhaps even hardly observed it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/145.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>145:10-21 All God's works show forth his praises. He satisfies the desire of every living thing, except the unreasonable children of men, who are satisfied with nothing. He does good to all the children of men; his own people in a special manner. Many children of God, who have been ready to fall into sin, to fall into despair, have tasted his goodness in preventing their falls, or recovering them speedily by his graces and comforts. And with respect to all that are heavy laden under the burden of sin, if they come to Christ by faith, he will ease them, he will raise them. He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of his people. He is present every where; but in a special way he is nigh to them, as he is not to others. He is in their hearts, and dwells there by faith, and they dwell in him. He is nigh to those that call upon him, to help them in all times of need. He will be nigh to them, that they may have what they ask, and find what they seek, if they call upon him in truth and sincerity. And having taught men to love his name and holy ways, he will save them from the destruction of the wicked. May we then love his name, and walk in his ways, while we desire that all flesh should bless his holy name for ever and ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/145.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom ... - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-16.htm">Psalm 10:16</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a>, note.

So it is opposed to all other kingdoms and monarchies, which have had or will have an end; as the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman; with all other states which will be on the spot when this kingdom is set up in its glory, and will continue for ever, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; and the King of it is opposed to all other kings, who die, and their kingdoms are no more to them; but he never dies, he lives for evermore; he is the living God, and so an everlasting King: nor will his kingdom cease at the end of the thousand years, nor when delivered to the Father; only it shall be in a different place and form, and shall remain for ever; for his saints will reign for ever and ever, and he with them. Or it may be rendered, "a kingdom of all worlds" (e), or "ages"; Christ's kingdom reaching to all worlds; heaven, earth, and hell: or which, according to Arama, takes in the world above, below, and middle; and regards all times past, present, and to come: <p>and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations: in this world, and that to come; there is no end of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>. This psalm is written alphabetically, as is observed on the title of it; but the letter "nun" is here wanting, the reason of which Kimchi professes his ignorance of: but Jarchi gives a reason for it, such an one as it is, which he has from the Talmud (f); because David, by a spirit of prophecy, foresaw the grievous fall of the people of Israel, the prophecy of which begins with this letter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-2.htm">Amos 5:2</a>. Nor is the order always strictly observed in alphabetical psalms; in the thirty-seventh psalm the letter "ain" is wanting, and three in the twenty-fifth psalm. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, supply this defect here, by inserting these words, "the Lord is faithful in all his words, and holy in all his works", as if they were begun with the word  but they seem to be taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>, with a little alteration. <p>(e)   "reguum omnium seculorum", V.

We are reminded of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2</a>, and the likewise alphabetical song of praise and thanksgiving <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a>. The plena scriptio &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-6.htm">Psalm 98:6</a>. The language of address "my God the King," which sounds harsh in comparison with the otherwise usual "my King and my God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-4.htm">Psalm 84:4</a>), purposely calls God with unrelated generality, that is to say in the most absolute manner, the King. If the poet is himself a king, the occasion for this appellation of God is all the more natural and the signification all the more pertinent. But even in the mouth of any other person it is significant. Whosoever calls God by such a name acknowledges His royal prerogative, and at the same time does homage to Him and binds himself to allegiance; and it is just this confessory act of exalting Him who in Himself is the absolutely lofty One that is here called &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;. But who can the poet express the purpose of praising God's Name for ever? Because the praise of God is a need of his inmost nature, he has a perfect right to forget his own mortality when engaged upon this devotion to the ever-living King. Clinging adoringly to the Eternal One, he must seem to himself to be eternal; and if there is a practical proof for a life after death, it is just this ardent desire of the soul, wrought of God Himself, after the praise of the God of its life (lit., its origin) which affords it the highest, noblest delight. The idea of the silent Hades, which forces itself forward elsewhere, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>, where the mind of the poet is beclouded by sin, is here entirely removed, inasmuch as here the mind of the poet is the undimmed mirror of the divine glory. Therefore <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-2.htm">Psalm 145:2</a> also does not concede the possibility of any interruption of the praise: the poet will daily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>) bless God, be they days of prosperity or of sorrow, uninterruptedly in all eternity will he glorify His Name (&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-31.htm">Psalm 69:31</a>). There is no worthier and more exhaustless object of praise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>): Jahve is great, and greatly to be praised (&#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/96-4.htm">Psalm 96:4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>), and of His "greatness" (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a>, where this attribute precedes all others) there is no searching out, i.e., it is so abysmally deep that no searching can reach its bottom (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>.). It has, however, been revealed, and is being revealed continually, and is for this very reason thus celebrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a> : one generation propagates to the next the growing praise of the works that He has wrought out (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;), and men are able to relate all manner of proofs of His victorious power which prevails over everything, and makes everything subject to itself (&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, and frequently). This historically manifest and traditional divine doxa and the facts (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>) of the divine wonders the poet will devoutly consider. &#1492;&#1491;&#1512; stands in attributive relation to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, as this on its part does to &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1498;. Thy brilliantly gloriously (kingly) majesty (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>). The poet does not say &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, nor may we insert it, either here in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-6.htm">Psalm 145:6</a>, where the same sequence of thoughts recurs, more briefly expressed. The emphasis lies on the objects. The mightiness (&#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>, where it signifies violence) of His terrible acts shall pass from mouth to mouth (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; with a substantival object as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>), and His mighty acts (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, magnalia, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>) - according to the Ker (which is determined by the suffix of &#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;; cf. however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-23.htm">2 Samuel 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-3.htm">2 Kings 3:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26</a>, and frequently): His greatness (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) - will he also on his part make the matter of his narrating. It is, however, not alone the awe-inspiring majesty of God which is revealed in history, but also the greatness (&#1512;&#1489; used as a substantive as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>, whereas &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a> is an adjective placed before the noun after the manner of a numeral), i.e., the abundant measure, of His goodness and His righteousness, i.e., His acting in inviolable correspondence with His counsel and order of salvation. The memory of the transcendent goodness of God is the object of universal, overflowing acknowledgement and the righteousness of God is the object of universal exultation (&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503; with the accusative as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-17.htm">Psalm 59:17</a>). After the poet has sung the glorious self-attestation of God according to both its sides, the fiery and the light sides, he lingers by the light side, the front side of the Name of Jahve unfolded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. </body></html>
