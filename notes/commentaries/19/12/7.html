Let us see what makes the times bad, and when they may be said to be so. Ask the children of this world, What makes the times bad? they will tell you, Scarcity of money, decay of trade, and the desolations of war, make the times bad: but the Scripture lays the badness of the times on causes of another nature, 2Ti 3:1, c.: perilous times shall come, for sin shall abound; and of this David complains. When piety decays times really are bad. He who made man's mouth will call him to an account for his proud, profane, dissembling, or even useless words. When the poor and needy are oppressed, then the times are very bad. God himself takes notice of the oppression of the poor, and the sighing of the needy. When wickedness abounds, and is countenanced by those in authority, then the times are very bad. See with what good things we are here furnished for such bad times; and we cannot tell what times we may be reserved for. 1. We have a God to go to, from whom we may ask and expect the redress of all our grievances. 2. God will certainly punish and restrain false and proud men. 3. God will work deliverance for his oppressed people. His help is given in the fittest time. Though men are false, God is faithful; though they are not to be trusted, God is. The preciousness of God's word is compared to silver refined to the highest degree. How many proofs have been given of its power and truth! God will secure his chosen remnant, however bad the times are. As long as the world stands, there will be a generation of proud and wicked men. But all God's people are put into the hands of Christ our Saviour; there they are in safety, for none can pluck them thence; being built on Him, the Rock, they are safe, notwithstanding temptation or persecution come with ever so much force upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Thou shalt keep them That is, the persons referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a> - the poor and the needy who were suffering from the wrongs inflicted on them. The idea is, that God would guard and defend them. They were safe in his hands. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3-7</a>.<p>From this generation - This generation, or this race of detractors, flatterers, and oppressors. The idea is, that that entire generation was eminently wicked, and that none but God could deliver the poor and the needy from their designs.<p>Forever - That is, "constantly," or as long as they would need the divine protection. God would not interpose and save them from the "present" trouble, and then leave them to the designs of their enemies, but he would "always" interpose as often as there was any need of his help. That is, they were now, and would be at all times, entirely safe. They had nothing to fear, for God was their refuge and their help. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. them&#8212;(Margin.)<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou shalt keep them; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Not the words before mentioned, as Aben Ezra explains it, for the affix is masculine and not feminine; not but God has wonderfully kept and preserved the sacred writings; and he keeps every word of promise which he has made; and the doctrines of the Gospel will always continue from one generation to another; but the sense is, that God will keep the poor and needy, and such as he sets in safety, as Kimchi rightly observes: they are not their own keepers, but God is the keeper of them; he keeps them by his power, and in his Son, in whose hands they are, and who is able to keep them from falling; they are kept by him from a total and final falling away; from the dominion and damning power of sin, and from being devoured by Satan, and from the evil of the world: and this the psalmist had good reason to believe, because of the love of God to them, his covenant with them, and the promises of safety and salvation he has made unto them; <p>thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever; or "thou shalt preserve him" (p); that is, everyone of the poor and needy, from the wicked generation of men in which they live, from being corrupted or intimidated by them; and who are described in the beginning of the psalm. Some take these words to be a prayer, "keep thou them, O Lord, and preserve them", &amp;c.

God having promised to set the righteous, who are oppressed, in a place of safety (ver. 5), the psalmist is sure that he will keep them and preserve them from the wicked "generation," which has possession of the earth, and bears rule in it, <span class="accented">always.</span> It is, no doubt, for the greater consolation and encouragement of these unfortunates that he dwells on the subject, and adds his own  assurances to the Divine promise which he has recorded.

The "generation" is that of the worldly men in power at the time, of whom we have heard in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1, 2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-4.htm">Psalm 5:4-6, 9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-1.htm">Psalm 7:1, 2, 9, 13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2-11, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2, 3, 6</a>. "For ever" means "so long as they live." The substitution of "him' for "them" in this clause is an instance of that generalization by which a whole class is summed up in a single individual - " all men" in "man," "all good men" in "the righteous" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;</span>), and the like. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 12:2-3) The sigh of supplication, &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;, has its object within itself: work deliverance, give help; and the motive is expressed by the complaint which follows. The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; to complete, means here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>, to have an end; and the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1505; is equivalent to &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-9.htm">Psalm 77:9</a>, to come to the extremity, to cease. It is at once clear from the predicate being placed first in the plur., that &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in this passage is not an abstractum, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>; moreover the parallelism is against it, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491; is the pious man, as one who practises &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; towards God and man. &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, primary form &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (plur. &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; whereas from &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; we should expect &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;), - used as an adjective (cf. on the contrary <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>) here just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a>, - is the reliable, faithful, conscientious man, literally one who is firm, i.e., whose word and meaning is firm, so that one can rely upon it and be certain in relation to it.<p>(Note: The Aryan root man to remain, abide (Neo-Persic ma&#770;nden), also takes a similar course, signifying usually "to continue in any course, wait, hope." So the old Persic man, Zend upaman, cf. &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; with its derivatives which are applied in several ways in the New Testament to characterise &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;.)<p>We find similar complaints of the universal prevalence of wickedness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a>, and elsewhere. They contain their own limitation. For although those who complain thus without pharisaic self-righteousness would convict themselves of being affected by the prevailing corruption, they are still, in their penitence, in their sufferings for righteousness' sake, and in their cry for help, a standing proof that humanity has not yet, without exception, become a massa perdita. That which the writer especially laments, is the prevailing untruthfulness. Men speak &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; ( equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;), desolation and emptiness under a disguise that conceals its true nature, falsehood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-7.htm">Psalm 41:7</a>), and hypocrisy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-13.htm">Job 35:13</a>), &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (lxx, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>, where the greatness of the sin finds its confirmation according to the teaching of the New Testament: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;).
