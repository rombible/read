Let us see what makes the times bad, and when they may be said to be so. Ask the children of this world, What makes the times bad? they will tell you, Scarcity of money, decay of trade, and the desolations of war, make the times bad: but the Scripture lays the badness of the times on causes of another nature, 2Ti 3:1, c.: perilous times shall come, for sin shall abound; and of this David complains. When piety decays times really are bad. He who made man's mouth will call him to an account for his proud, profane, dissembling, or even useless words. When the poor and needy are oppressed, then the times are very bad. God himself takes notice of the oppression of the poor, and the sighing of the needy. When wickedness abounds, and is countenanced by those in authority, then the times are very bad. See with what good things we are here furnished for such bad times; and we cannot tell what times we may be reserved for. 1. We have a God to go to, from whom we may ask and expect the redress of all our grievances. 2. God will certainly punish and restrain false and proud men. 3. God will work deliverance for his oppressed people. His help is given in the fittest time. Though men are false, God is faithful; though they are not to be trusted, God is. The preciousness of God's word is compared to silver refined to the highest degree. How many proofs have been given of its power and truth! God will secure his chosen remnant, however bad the times are. As long as the world stands, there will be a generation of proud and wicked men. But all God's people are put into the hands of Christ our Saviour; there they are in safety, for none can pluck them thence; being built on Him, the Rock, they are safe, notwithstanding temptation or persecution come with ever so much force upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words of the Lord - In contrast with the words of the persons referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2-4</a>. Their words were vanity, flattery, and falsehood; and no reliance could be placed on them. In contrast with these words, the words of the Lord were pure. They were to be relied on. All his sayings were true and faithful. The design is to bring his words into contrast with the sayings of such men, and to show how much more safety there is in relying on his promises than on the promises made by such men. Man failed, but God would not. Reliance could not be placed on the words of even the professedly "godly" and "faithful" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/12-1.htm">Psalm 12:1</a>, but entire confidence might be placed in the words of Yahweh. All his words were true, pure, faithful, so that even when his own professed friends failed, and confidence could be placed in them, yet there was still reason for unwavering confidence in God himself.<p>Are pure words - That is, they are without any mixture of falsehood - for this idea is implied in the comparison which the psalmist makes when he says that they are like silver purified in the furnace, that is, from which all the dross has been removed.<p>As silver tried in a furnace of earth - The word here rendered "furnace" properly means a workshop. Perhaps it corresponds nearly with our word "laboratory," as the term is now used by chemists. It evidently refers to some place where the metal was tried and purified. The words rendered "of earth" literally mean "on the earth," or "in the earth?" The language does not mean that the "furnace" was "made" of earth, as would seem to be implied in our version, but that the "furnace" or laboratory was erected on the earth, or in the earth. It may refer to something like a crucible placed on the ground, around which a fire of intense heat could be made. It is probable that some such structure would be made near the mines where ore was obtained, and that the ore would be thus purified from dross before it was removed.<p>Purified seven times - By passing it seven times - that is, very often - through the fire. The word "seven" in the Scriptures denotes a complete or perfect number, and is often used to denote frequency. The idea here would seem to be that the process was repeated until the silver became entirely pure. The sense is, that the words of the Lord are "perfectly pure." There is no admixture of falsehood in his statements; there is no deception in his promises; there is no flattery in what he says. This was the ground of confidence on the part of the psalmist - that while men (even those who professed to be good men) so failed that no reliance could be placed on their statements, the most perfect trust could be reposed on all the statements of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Man's words are yea and nay, but the Lord's promises are yea and amen. For truth, certainty, holiness, faithfulness, the words of the Lord are pure as well-refined silver. In the original there is an allusion to the most severely-purifying process known to the ancients, through which silver was passed when the greatest possible purity was desired; the dross was all consumed, and only the bright and precious metal remained; so clear and free from all alloy of error or unfaithfulness is the book of the words of the Lord. The Bible has passed through the furnace of persecution, literary criticism, philosophic doubt, and scientific discovery, and has lost nothing but those human interpretations which clung to it as alloy to precious ore. The experience of saints has tried it in every conceivable manner, but not a single doctrine or promise has been consumed in the most excessive hear. What God's words are, the words of his children should be. If we would be Godlike in conversation, we must watch our language, and maintain the strictest purity of integrity and holiness in all our communications.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-7.htm">Psalm 12:7</a><p>To fall into the hands of an evil generation, so as to be baited by their cruelty, or polluted by their influence, is an evil to be dreaded beyond measure; but it is an evil foreseen and provided for in the text. In life many a saint has lived a hundred years before his age, as though he had darted his soul into the brighter future, and escaped the mists of the beclouded present: he has gone to his grave unreverenced and misunderstood, and lo! as generations come and go, upon a sudden the hero is unearthed, and lives in the admiration and love of the excellent of the earth; preserved for ever from the generation which stigmatised him as a sower of sedition, or burned him as a heretic. It should be our daily prayer that we may rise above our age as the mountain-tops above the clouds, and may stand out as heaven-pointing pinnacle high above the mists of ignorance and sin which roll around us. O Eternal Spirit, fulfil in us the faithful saying of this verse! Our faith believes those two assuring words, and cries, "Thou shalt, thou shalt." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Pure; </span> or, <span class="ital">sincere</span>; without the least mixture of vanity or falsehood; and therefore shall infallibly be fulfilled.

You tell us, <span class="ital">The, Lord saith, I will set him in safety</span>, &c.; but saying and doing are two things. They are so indeed in men, who oft speak rashly what they cannot perform, and deceitfully what they never intend: but all God’s words are pure from all manner of dross; from all folly, or fraud, or uncertainty; he is holy and true in all his doctrines, threatenings, predictions, and promises. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tried in a furnace of earth, </span> i.e. made of such earth or clay as was proper for and then usual in that work.

This observation the psalmist makes in reference to what is just now said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>,, and in opposition to the words of wicked men in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>; which are deceitful, sinful, and impure. The Scriptures are the words of God; and they are pure and holy, free from all human mixtures, and from all fraud and deceit; they are the Scriptures of truth. The promises are the words of God, and they are firm and stable, and always to be depended on, and are ever fulfilled, being yea and amen in Christ Jesus. The Gospel, and the doctrines of it, are the words of God; that is the sincere milk of the word, pure and incorrupt; as it is in itself, and as it is dispensed by the faithful ministers of it; and they are all according to godliness, and tend to encourage and promote purity and holiness of heart and life; See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>; <p>as silver tried in a furnace of earth; they are as "silver" for worth and value; yea, they are more valuable than silver or gold, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>. The Bible is a mine of rich treasure, and to be searched into as for it; the promises in it are exceeding precious; they are like apples of gold in pictures of silver, and yield more joy than the finding a great spoil. The doctrines of the Gospel are comparable to gold and silver and precious stones, and to be bought at any rate, but to be sold at none: and they are as silver "tried", which is pure, and free from dross. The words of men, of false teachers, are as dross and reprobate silver; but the words of the Lord are tried, and are pure, and free from all the dross of error and falsehood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>. And they are as silver tried "in a furnace of earth", which some (o) render "by the Lord of the earth"; but the word rather signifies a furnace, or an refinery, in which metal is melted and purified; and may be applied to the Lord Jesus Christ in human nature, in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and who came full fraught with the doctrines of the Gospel; and in whom they have been "tried", by his sufferings and death, and are found to be pure, solid, and substantial: or to the ministers of the Gospel, who have this treasure in earthen vessels, whose works and words and ministry are tried by many fiery trials, and abide: or to all the people of God in general, who dwelt in earthly tabernacles; and who, in the midst of various afflictions, have a comfortable and confirming evidence of the purity and truth of the words of God, of the promises of his covenant, and the doctrines of the Gospel; <p>purified seven times; that is, many times, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>; and so completely and perfectly pure, and clear of all dross whatsoever, as silver so many times tried must needs be: and so the words of God are not only pure, but very pure, exceeding pure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-140.htm">Psalm 119:140</a>. <p>(o) Vid.

The shorter form of the future is frequently indicative in the sense of the future, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-13.htm">Psalm 72:13</a>, or of the present, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>, or of the past, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>. Thus it here affirms a fact of the future which follows as a necessity from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-5.htm">Psalm 11:5</a>. Assuming that &#1508;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; might be equivalent to &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, even then the Hebrew &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;, according to the general usage of the language, in distinction from &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;, does not denote burning, but black coals. It ought therefore to have been &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;. Hitzig reads &#1508;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495; ashes; but a rain of ashes is no medium of punishment. B&#1510;ttcher translates it "lumps" according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-3.htm">Exodus 39:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-3.htm">Numbers 17:3</a>; but in these passages the word means thin plates. We adhere to the signification snares, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-10.htm">Job 22:10</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5</a>; and following the accentuation, we understand it to be a means of punishment by itself. First of all descends a whole discharge of missiles which render all attempt at flight impossible, viz., lightnings; for the lightning striking out its course and travelling from one point in the distance, bending itself like a serpent, may really be compared to a snare, or noose, thrown down from above. In addition to fire and brimstone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) we have also &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1494;&#1500;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;. The lxx renders it &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and the Targum &#1494;&#1506;&#1508;&#1488; &#1506;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, procella turbinea. The root is not &#1500;&#1506;&#1507;, which cannot be sustained as a cognate form of &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;, &#1500;&#1488;&#1489; to burn, but &#1494;&#1506;&#1507;, which (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-10.htm">1 Samuel 5:10</a> shows) exactly corresponds to the Latin aestuare which combines in itself the characteristics of heat and violent motion, therefore perhaps: a wind of flames, i.e., the deadly simoom, which, according to the present division of the verse is represented in connection with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, as the breath of the divine wrath pouring itself forth like a stream of brimstone, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>. It thus also becomes clear how this can be called the portion of their cup, i.e., what is adjudged to them as the contents of their cup which they must drain off. &#1502;&#1504;&#1514; (only found in the Davidic Psalms, with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-4.htm">2 Chronicles 31:4</a>) is both absolutivus and constructivus according to Olshausen (108, c, 165, i), and is derived from manajath, or manawath, which the original feminine termination ath, the final weak radical being blended with it. According to Hupfeld it is constr., springing from &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, like &#1511;&#1510;&#1514; (in Dan. and Neh.) form &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;. But probably it is best to regard it as  equals  &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;.<p>Thus then Jahve is in covenant with David. Even though he cannot defend himself against his enemies, still, when Jahve gives free course to His hatred in judgment, they will then have to do with the powers of wrath and death, which they will not be able to escape. When the closing distich bases this different relation of God towards the righteous and the unrighteous and this judgment of the latter on the righteousness of God, we at once perceive what a totally different and blessed end awaits the righteous. As Jahve Himself is righteous, so also on His part (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-7.htm">1 Samuel 12:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/6-5.htm">Micah 6:5</a>, and frequently) and on the part of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>) He loves &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, the works of righteousness. The object of &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; ( equals  &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;) stands at the head of the sentence, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/99-4.htm">Psalm 99:4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a> &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; designates the upright as a class, hence it is the more natural for the predicate to follow in the plur. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-19.htm">Job 8:19</a>) than to precede as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>). The rendering: "His countenance looks upon the upright man" (Hengst. and others) is not a probable one, just because one expects to find something respecting the end of the upright in contrast to that of the ungodly. This rendering is also contrary to the general usage of the language, according to which &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is always used only as that which is to be seen, not as that which itself sees. It ought to have been &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-7.htm">Job 36:7</a>. It must therefore be translated according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-13.htm">Psalm 140:13</a> : the upright (quisquis probus est) shall behold His countenance. The pathetic form &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; instead of &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; was specially admissible here, where God is spoken of (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-15.htm">Isaiah 44:15</a>). It ought not to be denied any longer that mo is sometimes (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>) a dignified singular suffix. To behold the face of God is in itself impossible to mortals without dying. But when God reveals Himself in love, then He makes His countenance bearable to the creature. And to enjoy this vision of God softened by love is the highest honour God in His mercy can confer on a man; it is the blessedness itself that is reserved for the upright, 140:14. It is not possible to say that what is intended is a future vision of God; but it is just as little possible to say that it is exclusively a vision in this world. To the Old Testament conception the future &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is certainly lost in the night of Shel. But faith broke through this night, and consoled itself with a future beholding of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a>. The redemption of the New Testament has realised this aspiration of faith, since the Redeemer has broken through the night of the realm of the dead, has borne on high with Him the Old Testament saints, and translated them into the sphere of the divine love revealed in heaven. </body></html>
