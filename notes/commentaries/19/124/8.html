The enemies lay snares for God's people, to bring them into sin and trouble, and to hold them there. Sometimes they seem to prevail; but in the Lord let us put our trust, and we shall not be put to confusion. The believer will ascribe all the honour of his salvation, to the power, mercy, and truth of God, and look back with wonder and thanksgiving on the way in which the Lord has led him.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a>.<p>Who made heaven and earth - The great Creator; the true God. Our deliverances have led us up to him. They are such as can be ascribed to him alone. They could not have come from ourselves; from our fellow-men; from angels; from any or all created beings. Often in life, when delivered from danger, we may feel this; we always may feel this, and should feel this, when we think of the redemption of our souls. That is a work which we of ourselves could never have performed; which could not have been done for us by our fellow-men; which no angel could have accomplished; which all creation combined could not have worked out; which could have been effected by no one but by him who "made heaven and earth;" by him who created all things.

"Is in the name of the Lord." Jehovah's revealed character is our foundation of confidence, his person is our sure fountain of strength. "Who made heaven and earth." Our Creator is our preserver. He is immensely great in his creating work; he has not fashioned a few little things alone, but all heaven and the whole round earth are the works of his hands. When we worship the Creator let us increase our trust in our Comforter. Did he create all that we see, and can he not preserve us from evils which we cannot see? Blessed be his name, he that has fashioned us will watch over us; yea, he has done so, and rendered us help in the moment of jeopardy. He is our help and our shield, even he alone. He will to the end break every snare. He made heaven for us, and he will keep us for heaven; he made the earth, and he will succour us upon it until the hour cometh for our departure. Every work of his hand preaches to us the duty and the delight of reposing upon him only. All nature cries, "Trust ye in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah there is everlasting strength." "Wherefore comfort one another with these words."<p>The following versification of the sense rather than the words of this Psalm is presented to the reader with much diffidence: - <p>Had not the Lord, my soul may cry,<p>Had not the Lord been on my side;<p>Had he not brought deliverance nigh,<p>Then must my helpless soul have died.<p>Had not the Lord been on my side,<p>My soul had been by Satan slain;<p>And Tophet, opening large and wide,<p>Would not have gaped for me in vain.<p>Lo, floods of wrath, and floods of hell,<p>In fierce impetuous torrents roll;<p>Had not the Lord defended well,<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/124.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/124.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Our help is in the name of the Lord,.... This is the conclusion the church draws from the scene of Providence in her favour; this is the instruction she learns from hence, that her help is in the Lord only, and not in any creature; and that it is right to put her trust and confidence in the Lord for it, and only to expect it from him whose name is in himself; and is a strong tower to flee unto for safety, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>.

But, notwithstanding the subject that is placed first (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-13.htm">Genesis 23:13</a>), the &#1513;&#1473; belongs to the &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;; since in the Aramaizing Hebrew (cf. on the other hand <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>) &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473; (cf. Arab. lawla&#770; an) signifies nisi (prop. nisi quod), as in the Aramaic (&#1491;&#1468;) &#1513;&#1473; (&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;) &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;, o si (prop. o si quod). The &#1488;&#1494;&#1497;, peculiar to this Psalm in the Old Testament, instead of &#1488;&#1494; follows the model of the dialectic &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;, Arab. id&#817;an, Syr. ha&#772;den (&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1492;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;). In order to begin the apodosis of &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; (&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;) emphatically the older language makes use of the confirmatory &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-10.htm">Genesis 43:10</a>; here we have &#1488;&#1494;&#1497; (well rendered by the lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-92.htm">Psalm 119:92</a>. The Lamed of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1504;&#1493; is raphe in both instances, according to the rule discussed above, p. 373. When men (&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;) rose up against Israel and their anger was kindled against them, they who were feeble in themselves over against the hostile world would have been swallowed up alive if they had not had Jahve for them, if they had not had Him on their side. This "swallowing up alive" is said elsewhere of Hades, which suddenly and forcibly snatches away its victims, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>; here, however, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-6.htm">Psalm 124:6</a> shows, it is said of the enemies, who are represented as wild beasts. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4</a> the hostile power which rolls over them is likened to an overflowing stream, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>., the Assyrian. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, a stream or river, is Milel; it is first of all accusative: towards the stream (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>); then, however, it is also used as a nominative, like &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;, and the like (cf. common Greek &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;); so that  &#1514;&#1492;- is related to  &#1514;- ( &#1492;-) as  &#1504;&#1492;-,  &#1502;&#1493;- to  &#1503;- and  &#1501;- (Bttcher, 615). These latest Psalms are fond of such embellishments by means of adorned forms and Aramaic or Aramaizing words. &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is a word which is indeed not unhebraic in its formation, but is more indigenous to Chaldee; it is the Targum word for &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-51.htm">Psalm 119:51</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-78.htm">Psalm 119:78</a> (also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm">Psalm 54:5</a> for &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), although according to Levy the MSS do not present &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; but &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;. In the passage before us the Targum renders: the king who is like to the proud waters (&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1497; &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;) of the sea (Antiochus Epiphanes? - a Scholium explains &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;).
