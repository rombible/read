Happy the people whose God is Jehovah, a God all-sufficient. Besides applying this to any particular deliverance wrought in our days and the ancient times, we should have in our thoughts the great work of redemption by Jesus Christ, by which believers were rescued from Satan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/124.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the proud waters had gone over our soul - Over us. The word proud here is applied to the waters as if raging, swelling, rolling, tumultuous; as if they were self-confident, arrogant, haughty. Such raging billows, as they break and dash upon the shore, are a striking embIem of human passions, whether in an individual, or in a gathering of men - as an army, or a mob. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>. This is again an amplification, or an ascent of thought. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-2.htm">Psalm 124:2</a>. It is, however, nothing more than a poetical embellisment, adding intensity to the expression. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/124.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

It begins with a Kyrie eleison, which is confirmed in a crescendo manner after the form of steps. The church is already abundantly satiated with ignominy. &#1512;&#1489; is an abstract "much," and &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/62-3.htm">Psalm 62:3</a>, something great (vid., B&#1510;ttcher, Lehrbuch, &#1431;624). The subjectivizing, intensive &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; accords with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-6.htm">Psalm 120:6</a> - probably an indication of one and the same author. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; is strengthened by &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1494; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>. The article of &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1490; is restrospectively demonstrative: full of such scorn of the haughty (Ew. &#1431;290, d). &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; is also retrospectively demonstrative; but since a repetition of the article for the fourth time would have been inelegant, the poet here says &#1500;&#1490;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; with the Lamed, which serves as a circumlocution of the genitive. The Masora reckons this word among the fifteen "words that are written as one and are to be read as two." The Ker&#1502; runs viz., &#1500;&#1490;&#1488;&#1497; &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, superbis oppressorum (&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, part. Kal, like &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-1.htm">Zephaniah 3:1</a>, and frequently). But apart from the consideration that instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;, from the unknown &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, it might more readily be pointed &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; (a form of nouns indicating defects, contracted &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;), this genitival construction appears to be far-fetched, and, inasmuch as it makes a distinction among the oppressors, inappropriate. The poet surely meant &#1500;&#1490;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. This word &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (after the form &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) is perhaps an intentional new formation of the poet. Saadia interprets it after the Talmudic &#1500;&#1490;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, legio; but how could one expect to find such a Grecized Latin word (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;) in the Psalter! dunash ben-Labrat (about 960) regards &#1490;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as a compound word in the signification of &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. In fact the poet may have chosen the otherwise unused adjectival form &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; because it reminds one of &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, although it is not a compound word like &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. If the Psalm is a Maccabaean Psalm, it is natural to find in &#1500;&#1490;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; an allusion to the despotic domination of the &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. </body></html>
