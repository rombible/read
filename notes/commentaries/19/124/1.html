Happy the people whose God is Jehovah, a God all-sufficient. Besides applying this to any particular deliverance wrought in our days and the ancient times, we should have in our thoughts the great work of redemption by Jesus Christ, by which believers were rescued from Satan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/124.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If it had not been the Lord who was on our side - Unless it was Yahweh who was with us. The idea is, that someone had been with them, and had delivered them, and that such was the nature of the interposition that it could be ascribed to no one but Yahweh. It bore unmistakeable evidence that it was his work. The deliverance was of such a kind that it could have been accomplished by him only. Such things often occur in life, when the intervention in our behalf is so remarkable that we can ascribe it to no one else but God.<p>Now may Israel say - May well and truly say. The danger was so great, their helplessness was so manifest, and the deliverance was so clearly the work of God, that it was proper to say that if this had not occurred, ruin would have been inevitable and entire. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/124.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 124<p>Ps 124:1-8.

The opening sentence is abrupt, and remains a fragment. By such a commencement attention was aroused as well as feeling expressed: and this is ever the way of poetic fire - to break forth in uncontrollable flame. The many words in italics in our authorized version will show the reader that the translators did their best to patch up the passage, which, perhaps, had better have been left in its broken grandeur, and it would then have run thus: - <p>"Had it not been Jehovah! He was for us, oh let Israel say!<p>Had it not been Jehovah! He who was for us when men rose against us."<p>The glorious Lord became our ally; he took our part, and entered into treaty with us. If Jehovah were not our protector where should we be? Nothing but his power and wisdom could have guarded us from the cunning and malice of our adversaries; therefore, let all his people say so, and openly give him the honour of his preserving goodness. Here are two "ifs," and yet there is no "if" in the matter. The Lord was on our side, and Is still our defender, and will be so from henceforth, even for ever. Let us with holy confidence exult in this joyful fact. We are far too slow in declaring our gratitude, hence the exclamation which should be rendered, "O let Israel say." We murmur without being stirred up to it, but our thanksgiving needs a spur, and it is well when some warm-hearted friend bids us say what we feel. Imagine what would have happened if the Lord had left us, and then see what has happened because he has been faithful to us. Are not all the materials of a song spread before us? Let us sing unto the Lord.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-2.htm">Psalm 124:2</a><p>"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us." When all men combined, and the whole race of men seemed set upon stamping out the house of Israel, what must have happened if the covenant Lord had not interposed? When they stirred themselves, and combined to make an assault upon our quietude and safety, what should we have done in their rising if the Lord had not also risen? No one who could or would help was near, but the bare arm of the Lord sufficed to preserve his own against all the leagued hosts of adversaries. There is no doubt as to our deliverer, we cannot ascribe our salvation to any second cause, for it would not have been equal to the emergency; nothing less than omnipotence and omniscience could have wrought our rescue. We set every other claimant on one side, and rejoice because the Lord was on our side.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-3.htm">Psalm 124:3</a><p>"Then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us." They were so eager for our destruction that they would have made only one morsel of us, and have swallowed us up alive and whole in a single instant. The fury of the enemies of the church is raised to the highest pitch, nothing will content them but the total annihilation of God's chosen. Their wrath is like a fire which is kindled, and has taken such firm hold upon the fuel that there is no quenching it. Anger is never more fiery than when the people of God are its objects. Sparks become flames, and the furnace is heated seven times hotter when God's elect are to be thrust into the blaze. The cruel world would make a full end of the godly seed were it not that Jehovah bars the way. When the Lord appears, the cruel throats cannot swallow, and the consuming fires cannot destroy. Ah, if it were not Jehovah, if our help came from all the creatures united, there would be no way of escape for us: it is only because the Lord liveth that his people are alive.<p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm was composed by David in the name, and for the use of all the church and people of Israel, as a thanksgiving for their deliverance from some eminent danger or dangers from proud and potent enemies. Many such they had in David’s time; but which of them is here intended is hard to determine, and not worth the inquiry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The church setteth forth God’s mercy for a miraculous deliverance, out of the apparent danger of powerful enemies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/124-1.htm" title="If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;...">Psalm 124:1-5</a></span>, and blesseth him for it <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/124-6.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth....">Psalm 124:6-8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/124.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If it had not been the Lord who was on our side,.... Or, "was for us" (h). The Syriac version is, "that rose up for us"; against their enemies, that rose up against them, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/123-2.htm">Psalm 123:2</a>, or, "was with us", as Kimchi and Ben Melech; to help and assist, support and supply, strengthen and defend: or, "was among us", as the Arabic version; as their King, Protector, and Saviour. This implies that he was on their side; was for them, with them, and among them, and took their part against their enemies; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-6.htm">Psalm 118:6</a>; which if he had not done, their case would have been miserable and deplorable; or if any other had took their part, and not he, let them be who they would, angels or men. If God is on the side of us, it matters not who is against us; but if he is not on our side, or against us, it signifies nothing who is for us; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>. It suggests that the case of Israel now was so very forlorn and distressed, that none but the Lord himself could help them. Jehovah is on the side of his people in a spiritual sense, or otherwise it would be bad for them: God the Father is on their side; his love and relation to them engage him to be so; hence all those good things that are provided for them, and bestowed on them; nor will he suffer any to do them hurt, they being as dear to him as the apple of his eye; hence he grants them his gracious presence, supports them under all their trials and exercises, supplies all their wants, and keeps them by his power, and preserves them from all their enemies; so that they have nothing to fear from any quarter: Christ is on their side; he is the surety for them, the Saviour of them; has took their part against all their spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, the world, and death; has engaged with them, and conquered them; he is the Captain of their salvation, their King at the head of them, that protects and defends them here, and is their friend in the court of heaven; their Advocate and interceding High Priest there, who pleads their cause against Satan, and obtains every blessing for them: the Spirit of Jehovah is on their side, to carry on his own work in them; to assist them in their prayers and supplications; to secure them from Satan's temptations; to set up a standard for them, when the enemy comes in like a flood upon them; and to comfort them under all their castings down; and to work them up for, and bring them safe to, heaven: but were not this the case, what would become of them? <p>now may Israel say; this was a public case the psalmist here records, in which all Israel were concerned; and whom he calls upon to take notice of it, and directs them what to say on this occasion. <p>(h) "pro nobis", Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/124.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><<A Song of degrees of David.>> If <i>it had not been</i> the LORD who was <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> on our side, now may Israel say;</span><p>(a) He shows that God was ready to help at need and that there was no other way to be saved, but by this means alone.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/124.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>.

The reading &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, commended by Ewald, is a recollection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a> that is violently brought in here. The loving ones are comprehended with the beloved one, the children with the mother. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492; forms an alliteration with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;; the emphatic form &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; occurs even in other instances out of pause (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a> the alliteration of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; is again taken up, and both accord with the name of Jerusalem. Ad elegantiam facit, as Venema observes, perpetua vocum ad se invicem et omnium ad nomen Hierosolymae alliteratio. Both together mark the Song of degrees as such. Happiness, cries out the poet to the holy city from afar, be within thy bulwarks, prosperity within thy palaces, i.e., without and within. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, ramparts, circumvallation (from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, to surround, Arabic hawl, round about, equally correct whether written &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; or &#1495;&#1500;), and &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; as the parallel word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-14.htm">Psalm 48:14</a>. The twofold motive of such an earnest wish for peace is love for the brethren and love for the house of God. For the sake of the brethren is he cheerfully resolved to speak peace (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>) concerning (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; with &#1488;&#1500; and &#1500;, to speak peace to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-9.htm">Psalm 85:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/10-3.htm">Esther 10:3</a>) Jerusalem, for the sake of the house of Jahve will he strive after good (i.e., that which tends to her well-being) to her (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; &#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10</a>, cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-6.htm">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>). For although he is now again far from Jerusalem after the visit that is over, he still remains united in love to the holy city as being the goal of his longing, and to those who dwell there as being his brethren and friends. Jerusalem is and will remain the heart of all Israel as surely as Jahve who has His house there, is the God of all Israel. </body></html>
