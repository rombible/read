This he repeats both for the confirmation of it, and to excite the attention of the Israelites to it; as well as to observe that it was not once only, but again and again, many times the Lord appeared to be on their side. The Targum renders it, <p>"the Word of the Lord;'' <p>the essential Word, the Son of God; and so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/123-1.htm">Psalm 123:1</a>, in the king's Bible; <p>when men rose up against us; wicked men; though no hard epithet is given in the text, however just. The enemies of God's people are only called "men" by them, to show their meekness and patience; it is in the singular number, "when man rose up"; hence Aroma interprets it of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and R. Obadiah of Haman: but it might be better interpreted of the man of sin, the man of the earth; who, at the head of his antichristian party, has rose up against the saints, oppressed them, and threatened them with utter ruin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>.

Ad elegantiam facit, as Venema observes, perpetua vocum ad se invicem et omnium ad nomen Hierosolymae alliteratio. Both together mark the Song of degrees as such. Happiness, cries out the poet to the holy city from afar, be within thy bulwarks, prosperity within thy palaces, i.e., without and within. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, ramparts, circumvallation (from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, to surround, Arabic hawl, round about, equally correct whether written &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; or &#1495;&#1500;), and &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; as the parallel word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-14.htm">Psalm 48:14</a>. The twofold motive of such an earnest wish for peace is love for the brethren and love for the house of God. For the sake of the brethren is he cheerfully resolved to speak peace (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>) concerning (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; with &#1488;&#1500; and &#1500;, to speak peace to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-9.htm">Psalm 85:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/10-3.htm">Esther 10:3</a>) Jerusalem, for the sake of the house of Jahve will he strive after good (i.e., that which tends to her well-being) to her (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; &#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10</a>, cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-6.htm">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>). For although he is now again far from Jerusalem after the visit that is over, he still remains united in love to the holy city as being the goal of his longing, and to those who dwell there as being his brethren and friends. Jerusalem is and will remain the heart of all Israel as surely as Jahve who has His house there, is the God of all Israel. </body></html>
