As if he had said, These worthless, ungodly, blasphemous wretches, whose characters I have been delineating, these are the men who prosper in the world, who succeed in every thing they undertake, and roll in riches! What are we to think of God, his providence, and his promises?”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/73.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>73:1-14 The psalmist was strongly tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked; a common temptation, which has tried the graces of many saints. But he lays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is the goodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughts of God will fortify against Satan's temptations. The faith even of strong believers may be sorely shaken, and ready to fail. There are storms that will try the firmest anchors. Foolish and wicked people have sometimes a great share of outward prosperity. They seem to have the least share of the troubles of this life; and they seem to have the greatest share of its comforts. They live without the fear of God, yet they prosper, and get on in the world. Wicked men often spend their lives without much sickness, and end them without great pain; while many godly persons scarcely know what health is, and die with great sufferings. Often the wicked are not frightened, either by the remembrance of their sins, or the prospect of their misery, but they die without terror. We cannot judge men's state beyond death, by what passes at their death. He looked abroad, and saw many of God's people greatly at a loss. Because the wicked are so very daring, therefore his people return hither; they know not what to say to it, and the rather, because they drink deep of the bitter cup of affliction. He spoke feelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no disputing against sense, except by faith. From all this arose a strong temptation to cast off religion. But let us learn that the true course of sanctification consists in cleansing a man from all pollution both of soul and body. The heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ laid hold upon by faith; and by the begun works of the Lord's Spirit, manifested in the hearty resolution, purpose, and study of holiness, and a blameless course of life and actions, the hands are cleansed. It is not in vain to serve God and keep his ordinances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/73.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world - This is also to be understood as the language of the good man perplexed and embarrassed by the fact that the wicked are prosperous and happy. The meaning is, "Lo, these are wicked people - people of undoubted depravity; they are people who live regardless of God; and yet they are peaceful, tranquil, happy, prospered." This was one of the facts which so much embarrassed the psalmist. If there had been any doubt about the character of those people, the case would have been different. But there was none. They were people whose character for wickedness was well known, and yet they were permitted to live in peace and prosperity, as if they were the favorites of heaven. The literal meaning of the words rendered "who prosper in the world" is, "tranquil (or secure) for the age;" that is, forever, or constantly. They know no changes; they see no reverses; they are the same through life. They are always tranquil, calm, happy, successful.<p>They increase in riches - literally, "They become great in substance." They make constant accumulations in wealth, until they become great. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/73.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. prosper in the word&#8212;literally, "secure for ever."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/73.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">These are the ungodly; </span> this is their condition and carriage in it.

But it is preferable to regard them as the words of the Psalmist himself, expressing the thoughts which he had been tempted to indulge. (1) The form of the sentence, <span class="ital">Behold, such</span> &c., points to a summing up (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-27.htm" title="See this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know you it for your good.">Job 5:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/8-19.htm" title="Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow....">Job 8:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-21.htm" title="Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knows not God.">Job 18:21</a>); (2) ‘the wicked’ is a more natural designation for the Psalmist than for their own followers to use; (3) there is nothing to shew that the speaker in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-15.htm" title="If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of your children.">Psalm 73:15</a></span> is another than the speaker in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/73-13.htm" title="Truly I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence....">Psalm 73:13-14</a></span>; (4) the LXX (followed by the P.B.V.) inserts <span class="ital">And I said</span> at the beginning of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-13.htm" title="Truly I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence.">Psalm 73:13</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/73.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and they prosper always. <span class="cmt_word"></span>They increase in riches.</span> This is the impression which the psalmist has received from the general course of human affairs in his day.

In accordance with the gloominess of the theme, the style is also gloomy, and piles up the full-toned suffixes amo and emo (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-66.htm">Psalm 78:66</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-7.htm">Psalm 80:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/83-12.htm">Psalm 83:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-14.htm">Psalm 83:14</a>); both are after the example set by David. &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; with Beth of the object ion which the zeal or warmth of feeling is kindled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-31.htm">Proverbs 3:31</a>) here refers to the warmth of envious ill-feeling. Concerning &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-6.htm">Psalm 5:6</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3</a> tells under what circumsntaces the envy was excited; cf. so far as the syntax is concerned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-11.htm">Psalm 76:11</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-4.htm">Psalm 73:4</a> &#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1489;  equals  &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; from &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, cognate &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, whence &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, pain, Arabic &#8219;as&#803;a&#770;be, a snare, cf. &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;, and &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), in the same sense as the Latin tormenta (from torquere), is intended of pains that produce convulsive contractions. But in order to give the meaning "they have no pangs (to suffer) till their death," &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;) could not be omitted (that is, assuming also that &#1500;, which is sometimes used for &#1506;&#1491;, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-14.htm">Psalm 59:14</a>, could in such an exclusive sense signify the terminus ad quem). Also "there are no pangs for their death, i.e., that bring death to them," ought to be expressed by &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. The clause as it stands affirms that their dying has no pangs, i.e., it is a painless death; but not merely does this assertion not harmonize with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18</a>., but it is also introduced too early here, since the poet cannot surely begin the description of the good fortune of the ungodly with the painlessness of their death, and then for the first time come to speak of their healthy condition. We may therefore read, with Ewald, Hitzig, Bttcher, and Olshausen:<p>&#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;<p>&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;<p>i.e., they have (suffer) no pangs, vigorous (&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; like &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23</a>, &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>) and well-nourished is their belly; by which means the difficult &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; is got rid of, and the gloomy picture is enriched by another form ending with mo. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, here in a derisive sense, signifies the body, like the Arabic allun, a&#770;lun (from a&#770;l, coaluit, cohaesit, to condense inwardly, to gain consistency).<p>(Note: Hitzig calls to mind &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, "corporeal;" but this word is Ionic and equivalent to &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, solidus, the ground-word of which is the Sanscrit sarvas, whole, complete.)<p>The observation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-4.htm">Psalm 73:4</a> is pursued further in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-5.htm">Psalm 73:5</a> : whilst one would have thought that the godly formed an exception to the common wretchedness of mankind, it is just the wicked who are exempt from all trouble and calamity. It is also here to be written &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1502;&#1493;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-14.htm">Psalm 59:14</a>, not &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;. Therefore is haughtiness their neck-chain, and brutishness their mantle. &#1506;&#1504;&#1511; is a denominative from &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;  equals  &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;: to hang round the neck; the neck is the seat of pride (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;): haughtiness hangs around their neck (like &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;, a neck-ornament). Accordingly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a> &#1492;&#1502;&#1505; is the subject, although the interpunction construes it differently, viz., "they wrap round as a garment the injustice belonging to them," in order, that is, to avoid the construction of &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-14.htm">Psalm 65:14</a>) with &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;; but active verbs can take a dative of the object (e.g., &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; &#1500; ,, &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; &#1500;) in the sense: to be or to grant to any one that which the primary notion of the verb asserts. It may therefore be rendered: they put on the garment of violence (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; like &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497; &#1504;&#1511;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>), or even by avoiding every enallage numeri: violence covers them as a garment; so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; is an apposition which is put forth in advance. </body></html>
