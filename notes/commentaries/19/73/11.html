The following is the arrangement that seems preferable—<p>“And people say, How shall God know?<p>And does the Most High take notice of it?<p>Lo! there are wicked men, And yet, always at ease, they amass riches.<p>It is in vain then that I have kept my heart pure.<p>And washed my hands in innocence;<p>For I have been plagued every day,<p>And my punishments (come) every morning.”<p>—this reflection being put into the mouth of the public who are onlookers at the career of these timeservers. But the poet immediately goes on to disclaim it for himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/73.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm" title="And they say, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?">Psalm 73:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">And they say — </span>Namely, the ungodly, described in the preceding verses, (verse the 10th coming in by way of parenthesis,) or the people confederate with them, or that fall back to them.

Some such expressions as this were indeed charged on Job by his friends, but, although he had used many intemperate speeches, he utterly disowned such as these. <span class="ital">How doth God know?

For if God did know these things, and concerned himself with affairs here below, he certainly neither could nor would suffer them to be thus managed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/73.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>73:1-14 The psalmist was strongly tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked; a common temptation, which has tried the graces of many saints. But he lays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is the goodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughts of God will fortify against Satan's temptations. The faith even of strong believers may be sorely shaken, and ready to fail. There are storms that will try the firmest anchors. Foolish and wicked people have sometimes a great share of outward prosperity. They seem to have the least share of the troubles of this life; and they seem to have the greatest share of its comforts. They live without the fear of God, yet they prosper, and get on in the world. Wicked men often spend their lives without much sickness, and end them without great pain; while many godly persons scarcely know what health is, and die with great sufferings. Often the wicked are not frightened, either by the remembrance of their sins, or the prospect of their misery, but they die without terror. We cannot judge men's state beyond death, by what passes at their death. He looked abroad, and saw many of God's people greatly at a loss. Because the wicked are so very daring, therefore his people return hither; they know not what to say to it, and the rather, because they drink deep of the bitter cup of affliction. He spoke feelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no disputing against sense, except by faith. From all this arose a strong temptation to cast off religion. But let us learn that the true course of sanctification consists in cleansing a man from all pollution both of soul and body. The heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ laid hold upon by faith; and by the begun works of the Lord's Spirit, manifested in the hearty resolution, purpose, and study of holiness, and a blameless course of life and actions, the hands are cleansed. It is not in vain to serve God and keep his ordinances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/73.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they say - His people say. The connection demands this interpretation. The meaning is, that his people, as they return again and again to this subject <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/73-10.htm">Psalm 73:10</a>, are constrained to put this question. They are compelled by these facts to start such painful inquiries about God; and distressing as the inquiries are, and as are the doubts which they involve, these thoughts will pass through their mind, even though to avoid giving needless pain to those who have no such perplexities and difficulties they keep these thoughts to themselves, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>.<p>How doth God know? - That is, How can these facts be reconciled with God's omniscience? How can it be that he sees all this, and yet suffers it to occur, or that he does not interpose to prevent it? Is it not a fair inference from these facts that God does "not" see them, and that he is "not" an Omniscient Being? Can it be explained, can it be believed, that God sees all this, and that he calmly looks on, and does nothing to prevent it? If he sees it, why does he not interpose and put an end to it? These perplexities were not confined to the psalmist. They are such as have been felt by good people in all ages; and no one yet has been able to furnish a solution of them that is wholly free from difficulty.<p>And is there knowledge in the Most High? - Can there be in God a knowledge of these facts? Are we not driven to the conclusion that he must be ignorant of them? for, if he knew them, would he not interpose to prevent them? How "can" it be consistent with the idea that he "knows" them, and "sees" them, that he does "not" interpose, and that he suffers these things to take place without any attempt to check such evils? Who, even now, can answer these questions? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/73.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-12.

Owning there is a God, but questioning his knowledge; for the words are not an inquiry about the way and manner of his knowing things; which is not by the senses, as hearing and seeing; eyes and ears are improperly ascribed to him; nor in a discursive way, by reasoning, and inferring one thing from another; for he knows things intuitively, beholding all things in his own eternal mind and will: but they are a question about his knowledge itself, as follows: <p>and is their knowledge in the most High? they acknowledge God to be the most High, and yet doubt whether there is knowledge in him; and indeed the higher with respect to place, and at the greater distance he was from them, the less they imagined he knew of affairs below; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13</a> for the knowledge called in question is to be understood of his providential notice of human affairs, which they thought he did not concern himself with, as being below his regard; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a> and therefore concluded that their acts of oppression and violence, and their insolent words against God and men, would pass unobserved, and with impunity. If these are the words of good men, of the people of God under affliction, they are to be considered as under a temptation from their affliction, and the prosperity of the wicked, to call in question the providence of God in the government of the world, and his love to them, which is sometimes expressed by his knowledge of them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/73.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</span><p>(f) Thus the flesh moves even the godly to dispute with God concerning their poor estate, and the prosperity of the wicked.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/73.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-4.htm">Psalm 73:4</a> &#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1489;  equals  &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; from &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, cognate &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, whence &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, pain, Arabic &#8219;as&#803;a&#770;be, a snare, cf. &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;, and &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), in the same sense as the Latin tormenta (from torquere), is intended of pains that produce convulsive contractions. But in order to give the meaning "they have no pangs (to suffer) till their death," &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;) could not be omitted (that is, assuming also that &#1500;, which is sometimes used for &#1506;&#1491;, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-14.htm">Psalm 59:14</a>, could in such an exclusive sense signify the terminus ad quem). Also "there are no pangs for their death, i.e., that bring death to them," ought to be expressed by &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. The clause as it stands affirms that their dying has no pangs, i.e., it is a painless death; but not merely does this assertion not harmonize with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18</a>., but it is also introduced too early here, since the poet cannot surely begin the description of the good fortune of the ungodly with the painlessness of their death, and then for the first time come to speak of their healthy condition. We may therefore read, with Ewald, Hitzig, Bttcher, and Olshausen:<p>&#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;<p>&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;<p>i.e., they have (suffer) no pangs, vigorous (&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; like &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23</a>, &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>) and well-nourished is their belly; by which means the difficult &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; is got rid of, and the gloomy picture is enriched by another form ending with mo. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, here in a derisive sense, signifies the body, like the Arabic allun, a&#770;lun (from a&#770;l, coaluit, cohaesit, to condense inwardly, to gain consistency).<p>(Note: Hitzig calls to mind &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, "corporeal;" but this word is Ionic and equivalent to &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, solidus, the ground-word of which is the Sanscrit sarvas, whole, complete.)<p>The observation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-4.htm">Psalm 73:4</a> is pursued further in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-5.htm">Psalm 73:5</a> : whilst one would have thought that the godly formed an exception to the common wretchedness of mankind, it is just the wicked who are exempt from all trouble and calamity. It is also here to be written &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1502;&#1493;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-14.htm">Psalm 59:14</a>, not &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;. Therefore is haughtiness their neck-chain, and brutishness their mantle. &#1506;&#1504;&#1511; is a denominative from &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;  equals  &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;: to hang round the neck; the neck is the seat of pride (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;): haughtiness hangs around their neck (like &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;, a neck-ornament). Accordingly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a> &#1492;&#1502;&#1505; is the subject, although the interpunction construes it differently, viz., "they wrap round as a garment the injustice belonging to them," in order, that is, to avoid the construction of &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-14.htm">Psalm 65:14</a>) with &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;; but active verbs can take a dative of the object (e.g., &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; &#1500; ,, &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; &#1500;) in the sense: to be or to grant to any one that which the primary notion of the verb asserts. It may therefore be rendered: they put on the garment of violence (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; like &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497; &#1504;&#1511;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>), or even by avoiding every enallage numeri: violence covers them as a garment; so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; is an apposition which is put forth in advance. </body></html>
