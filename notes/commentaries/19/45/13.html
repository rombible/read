We must forget our carnal and sinful attachments and pursuits. He must be our Lord as well as our Saviour; all idols must be thrown away, that we may give him our whole heart. And here is good encouragement, thus to break off from former alliances. The beauty of holiness, both on the church and on particular believers, is, in the sight of Christ, of great price, and very amiable. The work of grace is the workmanship of the Spirit, it is the image of Christ upon the soul, a partaking of the Divine nature. It is clear of all sin, there is none in it, nor any comes from it. There is nothing glorious in the old man or corrupt nature; but in the new man, or work of grace upon the soul, every thing is glorious. The robe of Christ's righteousness, which he has wrought out for his church, the Father imputes unto her, and bestows upon her. None are brought to Christ, but those whom the Father brings. This notes the conversion of souls to him. The robe of righteousness, and garments of salvation, the change of raiment Christ has put upon her. Such as strictly cleave to Christ, loving him in singleness of heart, are companions of the bride, who partake of the very same grace, enjoy the same privileges, and share in one common salvation. These, every one, shall be brought to the King; not one lost or left behind. Instead of the Old Testament church, there shall be a New Testament church, a Gentile church. In the believing hope of our everlasting happiness in the other world, let us always keep up the remembrance of Christ, as our only way thither; and transmit the remembrance of him to succeeding generations, that his name may endure for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king's daughter - This evidently refers to the bride, the daughter of the foreign king. The verse contains a description of her beauty - her splendor of attire - before she is brought to the king, her future husband. She is represented here as in the palace or home of her father, before she is conducted forth to be given to her future husband in marriage. Is all "glorious." Is all splendor or beauty; is altogether splendor. There is nothing that is not splendid, rich, magnificent in her appearance, or in her apparel. As seen in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>, she is clad in gold; she is surrounded by honorable women - the daughters of kings <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>, and encompassed with the rich, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>. As seen here, she is in her father's house, adorned for the marriage, and to be brought to the king, her future husband, attired in all that could give grace and beauty to her person. The allusion here, as referring to the church - the "bride of the Lamb" - "may be" to that church considered as redeemed, and about to be received to heaven, to dwell with its Husband and Saviour. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-8</a>; notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>.<p>Within - This does not refer to herself, as if she was not merely splendid in her attire, but holy and pure - glorious and lovely - in "heart;" it refers to her as seen while yet "within" the palace or home of her father, in her own dwelling. The Hebrew word - &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;  pen&#305;&#770;yma&#770;h - means properly, "at or by the inner wall of a house, room, or court; that is, opposite to or in front of the door, and of those entering."

Within her secret chambers her glory is great. Though unseen of men her Lord sees her, and commends her. "It doth not yet appear what we shall be." Or the passage may be understood as meaning within herself - her beauty is not outward only or mainly; the choicest of her charms are to be found in her heart, her secret character, her inward desires. Truth and wisdom in the hidden parts are what the Lord regards; mere skin-deep beauty is nothing in his eyes. The church is of royal extraction, of imperial dignity, for she is a king's daughter; and she has been purified and renewed in nature, for she is glorious within. Note the word all. The Bridegroom was said to have all his garments perfumed, and now the bride is all glorious within - entireness and completeness are great points. There is no mixture of ill savour in Jesus, nor shall there be alloy of unholiness in his people, his church shall be presented without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing. "Her clothing is of wrought gold." Best material and best workmanship. How laboriously did our Lord work out the precious material of his righteousness into a vesture for his people! No embroidery of golden threads can equal that master-piece of holy art. Such clothing becomes one so honoured by relationship to the Great King. The Lord looks to it that nothing shall be wanting to the glory and beauty of his bride.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-14.htm">Psalm 45:14</a><p>"She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework." The day comes when the celestial marriage shall be openly celebrated, and these words describe the nuptial procession, wherein the queen is brought to her royal Husband attended by her handmaidens. In the latter-day glory, and in the consummation of all things, the glory of the bride, the Lamb's wife, shall be seen by all the universe with admiration. While she was within doors, and her saints hidden ones, the church was glorious; what will be her splendour when she shall appear in the likeness of her Lord in the day of his manifestation? The finest embroidery is but a faint image of the perfection of the church when sanctified by the Spirit. This verse tells us of the ultimate rest of the church - the King's own bosom; of the way she comes to it, she is brought by the power of sovereign grace; of the time when this is done - in the future, "she shall be," it does not yet appear; of the state in which she shall come - clad in richest array, and attended by brightest spirits. "The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee." Those who love and serve the church for her Lord's sake shall share in her bliss "in that day." In one sense they are a part of the church, but for the sake of the imagery they are represented as maids of honour; and, though the figure may seem incongruous, they are represented as brought to the King with the same loving familiarity as the bride, because the true servants of the church are of the church, and partake in all her happiness. Note that those who are admitted to everlasting communion with Christ, are pure in heart - virgins, pure in company - "her companions," pure in walk - "that follow her." Let none hope to be brought into heaven at last who are not purified now.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-15.htm">Psalm 45:15</a><p>"With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought." Joy becomes a marriage feast. What joy will that be which will be seen at the feasts of paradise when all the redeemed shall be brought home! Gladness in the saints themselves, and rejoicing from the angels shall make the halls of the New Jerusalem ring again with shoutings. "They shall enter into the King's palace." Their peaceful abodes shall be where Jesus the King reigns in state for ever. They shall not be shut out but shut in. Rights of free entrance into the holiest of all shall be accorded them. Brought by grace, they shall enter into glory. If there was joy in the bringing, what in the entering? What in the abiding? The glorified are not field labourers in the plains of heaven, but sons who dwell at home, princes of the blood, resident in the royal palace. Happy hour when we shall enjoy all this and forget the sorrows of time in the triumphs of eternity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The king’s daughter, </span> i.e. the spouse; so called, either because she was the daughter of one king, and the wife of another; or because the spouse or wife is sometimes called the husband’s daughter; partly because she is supposed to be younger than he; and partly because of that respect and subjection which she oweth to him, and that fatherly care and affection which he oweth to her.

The "King's daughter "of this passage can be no other than the bride herself - the" queen" of ver. 9. As among her attendants some were "kings' daughters" (ver. 9), so she could be no less. She is "glorious," not only without, in her robe of" gold of Ophir," but also and especially within - in the inner chamber of the heart - where she is indeed "glorious," through the sanctifying presence of God's Holy Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Her clothing is of wrought</span> <span class="cmt_word">gold</span> (comp. ver. 9, and the comment <span class="accented">ad lee.</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 45:7-8) In order to avoid the addressing of the king with the word Elohim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a> has been interpreted, (1) "Thy throne of God is for ever and ever,", - a rendering which is grammatically possible, and, if it were intended to be expressed, must have been expressed thus (Nagelsbach, 64, g); (2) "Thy throne is God ( equals  divine) for ever and ever;" but it cannot possibly be so expressed after the analogy of "the altar of wood  equals  wooden" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>), or "the time is showers of rain  equals  rainy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-13.htm">Ezra 10:13</a>), since God is neither the substance of the throne, nor can the throne itself be regarded as a representation or figure of God: in this case the predicative Elohim would require to be taken as a genitive for &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, which, however, cannot possibly be supported in Hebrew by any syntax, not even by <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-17.htm">2 Kings 23:17</a>, cf. Ges. 110, 2, b. Accordingly one might adopt the first mode of interpretation, which is also commended by the fact that the earthly throne of the theocratic king is actually called &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>. But the sentence "thy throne of God is an everlasting one" sounds tautological, inasmuch as that which the predicate asserts is already implied in the subject; and we have still first of all to try whether &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; cannot, with the lxx &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, be taken as a vocative. Now, since before everything else God's throne is eternal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-16.htm">Psalm 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-19.htm">Lamentations 5:19</a>), and a love of righteousness and a hatred of evil is also found elsewhere as a description of divine holiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>), &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; would be obliged to be regarded as addressed to God, if language addressed to the king did not follow with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;. But might &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; by any possibility be even addressed to the king who is here celebrated? It is certainly true that the custom with the Elohim-Psalms of using Elohim as of equal dignity with Jahve is not favourable to this supposition; but the following surpassing of the &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; by &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498; renders it possible. And since elsewhere earthly authorities are also called &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/82-1.htm">Psalm 82:1-8</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/138-1.htm">Psalm 138:1</a>, because they are God's representatives and the bearers of His image upon earth, so the king who is celebrated in this Psalm may be all the more readily styled Elohim, when in his heavenly beauty, his irresistible doxa or glory, and his divine holiness, he seems to the psalmist to be the perfected realization of the close relationship in which God has set David and his seed to Himself. He calls him &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, just as Isaiah calls the exalted royal child whom he exultingly salutes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-1.htm">Psalm 9:1-6</a>, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;. He gives him this name, because in the transparent exterior of his fair humanity he sees the glory and holiness of God as having attained a salutary of merciful conspicuousness among men. At the same time, however, he guards this calling of the king by the name Elohim against being misapprehended by immediately distinguishing the God, who stands above him, from the divine king by the words "Elohim, thy God," which, in the Korahitic Psalms, and in the Elohimic Psalms in general, is equivalent to Jahve, thy God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-15.htm">Psalm 48:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>); and the two words are accordingly united by Munach.<p>(Note: The view that the Munach is here vicarius Tiphchae anterioris (Dachselt in his Biblia Accentuata) is erroneous, vid., Accentuationssystem, xviii. 4. It is the conjunctive to &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498;, which, in Heidenheim and Baer, on the authority of the Codices, has Tiphcha anterior, not Athnach as in the editions heretofore published. The proper place for the Athnach would at first be by &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;; but according to Accentuationssystem, xix. 6, it cannot stand there.)<p>Because the king's sceptre is a "sceptre of uprightness" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>), because he loves righteousness and consequently (fut. consec.) hates iniquity, therefore God, his God, has anointed him with the oil of joy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>; cf. on the construction <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>) above his fellows. What is intended is not the anointing to his office (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-21.htm">Psalm 89:21</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>) as a dedication to a happy and prosperous reign, but that God has poured forth upon him, more especially on this his nuptial day, a superabundant joy, both outwardly and in his spirit, such as He has bestowed upon no other king upon the face of the earth. That he rises high above all those round about him is self-evident; but even among his fellows of royal station, kings like himself, he has no equal. It is a matter of question whether the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>) has taken the first &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; of the expression &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; as a vocative. Apollinaris does not seem so to have understood him; for he renders it &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;, and the Greek expositors also take &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; here as a nominative. </body></html>
