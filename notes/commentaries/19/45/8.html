The heavenly mansions may not unfitly be called ivory palaces, as elsewhere, in the same figurative manner, they are said to be adorned with gold and precious stones; from which mansions Christ came into the world; into which Christ went, and where he settled his abode after he went out of the world; and from whence he poured forth all the fragrant gifts and graces of his Spirit.

While the Holy Spirit leads Christ's people to look to his cross, he teaches them to see the evil of sin and the beauty of holiness; so that none of them can feel encouragement to continue in sin. The Mediator is God, else he had been neither able to do the Mediator's work, nor fit to wear the Mediator's crown. God the Father, as his God in respect to his human nature and mediatorial offices, has given to him the Holy Spirit without measure. Thus anointed to be a Prophet, Priest, and King, Christ has pre-eminence in the gladdening gifts and graces of the spirit, and from his fulness communicates them to his brethren in human nature. The Spirit is called the oil of gladness, because of the delight wherewith Christ was filled, in carrying on his undertakings. The salvation of sinners is the joy of angels, much more of the Son. And in proportion as we are conformed to his holy image, we may expect the gladdening gifts influences of the Comforter. The excellences of the Messiah, the suitableness of his offices, and the sufficiency of his grace, seem to be intended by the fragrance of his garments. The church formed of true believers, is here compared to the queen, whom, by an everlasting covenant, the Lord Jesus has betrothed to himself. This is the bride, the Lamb's wife, whose graces are compared to fine linen, for their purity; to gold, for their costliness: for as we owe our redemption, so we owe our adorning, to the precious blood of the Son of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All thy garments smell of myrrh - The word "smell" is not in the original. The literal translation would be, "Myrrh, and aloes - cassia - all thy garments;" that is, they were so impregnated with perfumes that these seemed to constitute his very clothing. The mention of the "anointing" in the previous verse may have suggested the idea of these perfumes, as the anointing with a richly perfumed unguent seemed to have spread over, and to have pervaded all his raiment. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>. It was common, however, for Orientals to use much perfumery, particularly on festive occasions. Myrrh - &#1502;&#1512;  mo&#770;r or &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;  mur - is an article which exudes from a tree found in Arabia, and still more extensively in Abyssinia. It is obtained by making an incision in the bark. It constituted one of the earliest articles of commerce <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>, and was highly esteemed by the Egyptians and Jews, as well as by the Greeks and the Romans. It is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a> as an article used in the purification of women; and as a perfume, Sol 4:6; Sol 5:5. It was used among the ancients, not only as a perfume, but as a fumigator, and as an article of medicine, and was employed in embalming the bodies of the dead. Herodotus, speaking of the practice of embalming among the Egyptians, says, "They then fill the body with powder of pure myrrh, cassia, and other perfumes, except frankincense," ii. 86. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>. Of the tree which produces the myrrh, however, we have as yet no very accurate accounts. See Kitto's Encyc., art. "Mor."<p>And aloes - The word rendered "aloes" - &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;  'a&#774;ha&#770;lo&#770;th - occurs four times in the Old Testament: <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>, where it is rendered "lign-aloes;" and here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-17.htm">Proverbs 7:17</a>; Sol 4:14, where it is rendered "aloes." The reference is, undoubtedly, to some odoriferous substance, well known in ancient times. Why the word "aloe" has been used as a translation of the original word, in the English and in the older versions, it is not easy to ascertain, but it is certain that the substance referred to is not to be confounded with the bitter and nauseous aloes known as a medicine. It is now generally understood that the reference in the word as used in the Scriptures, is to a species of odoriferous tree growing in India, and which anciently doubtless constituted part of the valuable commerce of the East. It is not a "fruit" or a "gum," but the tree itself. It is a species of sweet-smelling "wood," and was valued on account of its fragrance. It is produced still in India. The tree is believed to be a native of the mountainous tracts east and southeast of Silhet, in about 24 degrees of north latitude. See Kitto's Encyc., art. "Ahalim."<p>And cassia. - Cassia - &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;  qetsiy&#8219;o&#770;th - is better known. It is a bark resembling cinnamon, but less aromatic. It is mentioned in two other places in the Scriptures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-19.htm">Ezekiel 27:19</a>. This, as well as "aloes," is a production of India and its islands. See Kitto's Encyc., art. "Ketzioth."<p>Out of the ivory palaces - That is, As thou comest out of the ivory palaces. The representation is that of the king as coming out of the palace where he dwelt, and as clad in apparel appropriate to his station, and surrounded by his attendants, diffusing joy all around them. The imagery has "chanqed" from what it was in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3-5</a>, where he goes forth as a conqueror, with his sword on his "thigh," and ascending his war-chariot. Here he appears clothed, indeed, in regal splendor, in the magnificence of state, but as the husband of the bride, and as encircled with the attendants of an Oriental court. Ivory palaces are palaces adorned with ivory, or where ivory constituted a prominent and striking part of the ornaments. It cannot be supposed that the palace was constructed entirely of ivory. Kitto supposes that this refers to the interior decorations, or that the walls were "inlaid" with ivory, gold, etc., as constituting a part of the decorations of the building. "Ivory," it would seem, was so abundant and conspicu ous that the name might be given to the whole structure. Such a palace was that built by Ahab: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>.<p>Whereby they have made thee glad - Hebrew, "from them (or thence) they have gladdened thee." That is, They, the attendants referred to more particularly in the following verses, have gladdened thee; have diffused around a general joy; have contributed to make thee happy. He was clad in robes that became his station, and was accompanied and surrounded by attendants who diffused around a general joy, and who made his own heart glad. The "idea" may be, that the Redeemer, the Messiah, is made happy by the affection and the companionship of the redeemed, his people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Talmudic &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498; &#1514;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, let thy tongue overflow with songs of praise). Whatever the heart is full of, with that the mouth overflows; the heart of the poet gushes over with a "good word." &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is a matter that finds utterance and is put into the form of words; and &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; describes it as good with the collateral idea of that which is cheerful, pleasing, and rich in promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a>). The fact that out of the fulness and oppression of his heart so good a word springs forth, arises from the subject in which now his whole powers of mind are absorbed: I am saying or thinking (&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; pausal form by Dech&#1502;, in order that the introductory formula may not be mistaken), i.e., my purpose is: &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, my works or creations (not sing., but plur., just as also &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-3.htm">Exodus 17:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-19.htm">Numbers 20:19</a>, where the connection leads one to expect the plural) shall be dedicated to the king; or even: the thought completely fills me, quite carries me away, that they concern or have reference to the king. In the former case &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; dispenses with the article because it is used after the manner of a proper name (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1</a>); in the latter, because the person retires before the office of dignity belonging to it: and this we, in common with Hitzig, prefer on account of the self-conscious and reflecting &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; by which it is introduced. He says to himself that it is a king to whom his song refers; and this lofty theme makes his tongue so eloquent and fluent that it is like the style of a &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Thus it is correctly rendered by the lxx; whereas &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; as an epithet applied to Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>) does not denote a rapid writer, but a learned or skilled scribe. Rapidly, like the style of an agile writer, does the tongue of the poet move; and it is obliged to move thus rapidly because of the thoughts and words that flow forth to it out of his heart. The chief thing that inspires him is the beauty of the king. The form &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1514;, which certainly ought to have a passive sense (Aquila &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;), cannot be explained as formed by reduplication of the first two radicals of the verb &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; (&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;); for there are no examples to be found in support of quinqueliterals thus derived. What seems to favour this derivation is this, that the legitimately formed Pealal &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492; (cf. the adjective &#1497;&#1508;&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;  equals  &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a>) is made passive by a change of vowels in a manner that is altogether peculiar, but still explicable in connection with this verb, which is a twofold weak verb. The meaning is: Thou art beyond compare beautifully fashioned, or endowed with beauty beyond the children of men. The lips are specially singled out from among all the features of beauty in him. Over his lips is poured forth, viz., from above, &#1495;&#1503; (gracefulness of benevolence), inasmuch as, even without his speaking, the form of his lips and each of their movements awakens love and trust; it is evident, however, that from such lips, full of &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, there must proceed also &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-22.htm">Luke 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:12</a>). In this beauty of the king and this charm of his lips the psalmist sees a manifestation of the everlasting blessing of God, that is perceptible to the senses. It is not to be rendered: because Elohim hath blessed thee for ever. The assertion that &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is used in some passages for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; cannot be proved (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>). But the meaning of the psalmist is, moreover, not that the king, because he is so fair and has such gracious lips, is blessed of God. If this were the idea, then the noble moral qualities of which the beauty of this king is the transparent form, ought to be more definitely expressed. Thus personally conceived, as it is here, beauty itself is a blessing, not a ground for blessing. The fact of the matter is this, beauty is denoted by &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; as a reason for the blessing being known or recognised, not as a reason why the king should be blessed. From his outward appearance it is at once manifest that the king is one who is blessed by God, and that blessed for ever. The psalmist could not but know that "grace is deceitful and beauty vain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>), therefore the beauty of this king was in his eyes more than mere earthly beauty; it appears to him in the light of a celestial transfiguration, and for this very reason as an imperishable gift, in which there becomes manifest an unlimited endless blessing. </body></html>
