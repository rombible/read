We must forget our carnal and sinful attachments and pursuits. He must be our Lord as well as our Saviour; all idols must be thrown away, that we may give him our whole heart. And here is good encouragement, thus to break off from former alliances. The beauty of holiness, both on the church and on particular believers, is, in the sight of Christ, of great price, and very amiable. The work of grace is the workmanship of the Spirit, it is the image of Christ upon the soul, a partaking of the Divine nature. It is clear of all sin, there is none in it, nor any comes from it. There is nothing glorious in the old man or corrupt nature; but in the new man, or work of grace upon the soul, every thing is glorious. The robe of Christ's righteousness, which he has wrought out for his church, the Father imputes unto her, and bestows upon her. None are brought to Christ, but those whom the Father brings. This notes the conversion of souls to him. The robe of righteousness, and garments of salvation, the change of raiment Christ has put upon her. Such as strictly cleave to Christ, loving him in singleness of heart, are companions of the bride, who partake of the very same grace, enjoy the same privileges, and share in one common salvation. These, every one, shall be brought to the King; not one lost or left behind. Instead of the Old Testament church, there shall be a New Testament church, a Gentile church. In the believing hope of our everlasting happiness in the other world, let us always keep up the remembrance of Christ, as our only way thither; and transmit the remembrance of him to succeeding generations, that his name may endure for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought - They shall come forth, attending the bride, with music and songs; the procession will be one of hilarity and joy.<p>They shall enter into the king's palace - That is, Moving from the palace of the royal father of the bride, or from her home, they will enter the palace of her husband, her future home.

It has portrayed the lovely king as a man, as a hero, and as a divine ruler; now it describes him as a bridegroom on the day of his nuptials. The sequence of the thoughts and of the figures corresponds to the history of the future. When Babylon is fallen, and the hero riding upon a white horse, upon whom is inscribed the name "King of kings and Lord of lords," shall have smitten the hostile nations with the sword that goeth out of His mouth, there then follows the marriage of the Lamb, for which the way has been prepared by these avenging victories (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>.). It is this final ga'mos which the Psalm, as a song of the congregation, when the light was dawning upon the Old Testament church, sees by anticipation, and as it were goes forth to meet it, rejoicing to behold it afar off. The king's garments are so thoroughly scented with costly spices that they seem to be altogether woven out of them. And &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; out of the ivory palaces enchant him. This &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; has been taken mostly, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-6.htm">Isaiah 52:6</a>), as a repetition of the &#1502;&#1503;: "out of ivory palaces, whence they enchant thee." But this repetition serves no special purpose. Although the apocopated plural in &#305;&#770;, instead of &#305;&#770;m, is controvertible in Biblical Hebrew (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>), still there is the venture that in this instance &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; is equivalent to &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the music of stringed instruments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-4.htm">Psalm 150:4</a>); and if in connection with any Psalm at all, surely we may venture in connection with this Psalm, which in other respects has such an Aramaic or North-Palestinian colouring, to acknowledge this apocope, here perhaps chosen on account of the rhythm. In accordance with our historical rendering of the Psalm, by the ivory palaces are meant the magnificent residences of the king, who is the father of the bride. Out of the inner recesses of these halls, inlaid within with ivory and consequently resplendent with the most dazzling whiteness, the bridegroom going to fetch his bride, as he approaches and enters them, is met by the sounds of festive music: viewed in the light of the New Testament, it is that music of citherns or harps which the seer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-2.htm">Revelation 14:2</a>) heard like the voice of many waters and of mighty thunder resounding from heaven. The Old Testament poet imagines to himself a royal citadel that in its earthly splendour far surpasses that of David and of Solomon. Thence issues forth the sound of festive music zealous, as it were, to bid its welcome to the exalted king.<p>Even the daughters of kings are among his precious ones. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; is the name for that which is costly, and is highly prized and loved for its costliness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-26.htm">Proverbs 6:26</a>). The form &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; resembles the form &#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>, in the appearance of the i and supplanting the Sheba mobile, and also in the Dag. dirimens in the &#1511; (cf. &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>).<p>(Note: It is the reading of Ben-Naphtali that has here, as an exception, become the receptus; whereas Ben-Asher reads &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;. Saadia, Rashi, Simson ha-Nakdan and others, who derive the word from &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512; (to visit, wait on), follow the receptus, comparing &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>, in support of the form of writing.

Luzzatto, Prolegomeni, cxcix., and Grammatica della Lingua Ebraica, 193.)<p>Now, however, he has chosen for himself his own proper wife, who is here called by a name commonly used of Chaldaean and Persian queens, and, as it seems (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>), a North-Palestinian name, &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1500;,<p>(Note: Bar-Ali says that in Babylonia Venus is called &#1493;&#1491;&#1500;&#1508;&#1514; &#1513;&#1490;&#1500;, vid., Lagarde, Gesammelte Abhandl. S. 17. Windischmann (Zoroastrische Studien, S. 161) erroneously compares c&#769;agar (pronounced tshagar) as a name of one of the two wives of Zarathustra; but it happens that this is not the name of the wife who holds the first rank (Neo-Persic padisha&#772;h-zen), but of the second (c&#769;akir-zen, bond-woman).)<p>instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;. From the fact that, glittering with gold of Ophir, she has taken the place of honour at the right hand of the king (&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, 3rd praet., not part.), it is evident that her relationship to the king is at this time just in the act of being completed. Who are those daughters of kings and who is this queen standing in closest relationship to the king? The former are the heathen nations converted to Christ, and the latter is the Israel which is remarried to God in Christ, after the fulness of the heathen is come in. It is only when Israel is won to Him, after the fulness of the heathen is come in (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>), that the morning of the great day will dawn, which this Psalm as a song of the church celebrates. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; cannot certainly, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1512;, be a personificative designation of heathen kingdoms, although &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1500; is the believing Israel conceived of as one person. It is actually kings' daughters as the representatives of their nations that are intended; and the relation of things is just the same here as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>, where, of the Israelitish church of the future, it is predicted that kings shall be its foster-fathers and their princesses its nursing-mothers. </body></html>
