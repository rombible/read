While the Holy Spirit leads Christ's people to look to his cross, he teaches them to see the evil of sin and the beauty of holiness; so that none of them can feel encouragement to continue in sin. The Mediator is God, else he had been neither able to do the Mediator's work, nor fit to wear the Mediator's crown. God the Father, as his God in respect to his human nature and mediatorial offices, has given to him the Holy Spirit without measure. Thus anointed to be a Prophet, Priest, and King, Christ has pre-eminence in the gladdening gifts and graces of the spirit, and from his fulness communicates them to his brethren in human nature. The Spirit is called the oil of gladness, because of the delight wherewith Christ was filled, in carrying on his undertakings. The salvation of sinners is the joy of angels, much more of the Son. And in proportion as we are conformed to his holy image, we may expect the gladdening gifts influences of the Comforter. The excellences of the Messiah, the suitableness of his offices, and the sufficiency of his grace, seem to be intended by the fragrance of his garments. The church formed of true believers, is here compared to the queen, whom, by an everlasting covenant, the Lord Jesus has betrothed to himself. This is the bride, the Lamb's wife, whose graces are compared to fine linen, for their purity; to gold, for their costliness: for as we owe our redemption, so we owe our adorning, to the precious blood of the Son of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Kings' daughters were among thy honorable women - Those who were in attendance on him and on the bride were from the most elevated ranks; among the most honorable of the earth. The word rendered "honorable women," means properly, precious, costly; and then, dear, beloved; and this might be rendered "kings' daughters are among thy beloved ones;" that is, in the number of thy maidens, or of those attending on thee. The allusion is to a marriage, and the description is drawn from the usual accompaniments of a marriage in the east. The design, as applicable to the Messiah and to his union with the Church, his bride, is to describe him as accompanied with every circumstance of distinction and honor, to throw around him all that constituted beauty and splendor in an Oriental marriage ceremony. Nothing of earth could be too rich or beautiful to illustrate the glory of the union of the Redeemer with his redeemed Church.<p>Upon thy right hand did stand the queen - The right hand is the place of honor, and that idea is intended here: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>. The idea here is, that the Church, the bride of the Lamb of God, as seen in the vision, is exalted to the highest post of honor. That Church has the place in his affections which the newly-married bride has in the affections of her husband.<p>In field of Ophir - In garments decked or ornamented with the finest gold.

Or "maids of honour" (n); who filled and adorned the king's court, and made a splendid appearance there, the same with the virgins, the companions of the bride, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-14.htm">Psalm 45:14</a>; and design truly gracious souls, believers in Christ, who are his "precious ones" (o), as the word may be rendered; the excellent in the earth, in whom is all his delight; the precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold; his portion, his jewels, his peculiar treasure, and the apple of his eye: and since they have been precious to him, they have been "honourable", as they are, both by birth and marriage, being born of God, and espoused to Christ; by their character, kings and priests; and by their company, being among princes, and especially by their having communion with Father, Son, and Spirit: and among these are "kings' daughters"; yea, they are all of them the sons and daughters of the King of kings; not by their first birth, by which they were mean, base, and dishonourable, wretched and miserable, and children of wrath, as others; but by their second birth, or regeneration, through being born from above, and of God, to an incorruptible inheritance; and so are clothed and fed like the daughters of kings, and have the attendance of such, angels to wait upon them and guard them; and through adopting grace, which regeneration is the evidence of, by virtue of which some of the children of men become the sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty; and through their marriage to the King's Son, the Lord Jesus Christ: the words may be rendered, "Kings' daughters were in thy precious things" (p); that is, were arrayed with them: meaning either the graces of the Spirit, comparable to gems, pearls, jewels, and precious stones; see Sol 1:10; or else the rich robe of Christ's righteousness, and garments of salvation, with which believers being clothed, are as a bridegroom decked with ornaments, and as a bride adorned with jewels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; and this agrees with what follows; <p>upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir; by whom is meant the church, whose title is a "queen", being the bride, the Lamb's wife: wherefore, because he is King, she is queen; for this title she has not of herself; it is founded not in her own right, but upon her relation to Christ, being married to him; and so is expressive of relation to him, union with him, and of privilege and dignity through him; she sharing with him in all he has, even in his kingdom and government, reigning with him, and on the same throne: her being "on his right hand" shows the honour she is advanced unto; yet "standing" may denote subjection to him as her Lord and head; and being so close by him may suggest her fidelity and inviolable attachment to him, and strict adherence to his person, cause and interest; as well as her protection from him, being held and upheld by his right hand; and her reception of favours from thence, and her enjoyment of his presence, at whose right hand are pleasures for evermore. Her dress is "gold of Ophir": a place famous for gold; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; with which the clothes of great personages used to be embroidered; so Esther is said (q) to put on her royal apparel, adorned with the good gold of "Ophir": here it means, that the queen's or church's clothing was of wrought gold, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a>, and intends the righteousness of Christ, with which she is arrayed, comparable to it for its richness, purity, lustre, glory, and duration. <p>(n) "inter noblies tuas", Tigurine version.

It may seem strange that such a degradation of the true ideal of marriage should find place in a Psalm which opens up such lofty thoughts and hopes. But the Psalm reflects the actual facts and customs of the age: it is not intended to depict a perfect state of things. One of the wives takes precedence of the rest and occupies the place of honour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-19.htm" title="Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah.

The marriage scene now begins to open upon us. The bridegroom has been depicted in all  his glorious majesty. The bride has now to be brought forward.

The "right hand" of the king was the place of honour.

He is a hero. The praise of his heroic strength takes the form of a summons to exert it and aid the good in obtaining the victory over evil. Brightness and majesty, as the objects to &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;, alternating with the sword, are not in apposition to this which is their instrument and symbol (Hengstenberg), but permutatives, inasmuch as &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; is zeugmatically referable to both objects: the king is (1) to gird himself with his sword, and (2) to surround himself with his kingly, God-like doxa. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512; is the brilliancy of the divine glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>), of which the glory of the Davidic kingship is a reflection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a>); mentioned side by side with the sword, it is, as it were, the panoply that surrounds the king as bright armour. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a> &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, written accidentally a second time, is probably to be struck out, as Olshausen and Hupfeld are of opinion. Hitzig points it &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, "and step forth;" but this is not Hebrew. As the text runs, wa-hada&#772;rcha (with Legarme preceded by Illuj, vid., Accentsystem xiii. 8c, 9) looks as though it were repeated out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-4.htm">Psalm 45:4</a> in the echo-like and interlinked style that we frequently find in the songs of degrees, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>; and in fact repeated as an accusative of more exact definition (in the same bold manner as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13-14</a>) to &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, which, like Arab. s&#803;lh&#803;, starting from the primary notion of cleaving, breaking through, pressing forward, comes to have the notion of carrying anything through prosperously, of being successful, pervadere et bene procedere (cf. the corresponding development of signification in Arab. flh&#803;, 'flh&#803;), and, according to Ges. 142, rem. 1, gives to &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; the adverbial notion of that which is effectual (victorious) or effective and successful. We cannot determine whether &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; is here intended to say vehi curru or vehi equo; but certainly not upon a mule or an ass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>), which are the beasts ridden in a time of peace. The king going forth to battle either rides in a war-chariot (like Ahab and Jehoshaphat, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>), or upon a war-horse, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a> the Logos of God is borne upon a white horse. That which he is to accomplish as he rides forth in majesty is introduced by &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; (for the sake of, on account of), which is used just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-9.htm">Psalm 79:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-5.htm">2 Samuel 18:5</a>. The combination &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;-is very similar to &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1470;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a> (nakedness - ignominy  equals  ignominious nakedness), if &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; is to be taken as the name of a virtue. The two words are then the names of virtues, like &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; (truth  equals  veracity, which loves and practises that which is true and which is hostile to lying, falseness, and dissimulation); and whereas &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; would signify meek righteousness, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, righteousness meekness, this conjunction standing in the middle between an addition and an asyndeton denotes meekness and righteousness as twin-sisters and reciprocally pervasive. The virtues named, however, stand for those who exemplify them and who are in need of help, on whose behalf the king is called upon to enter the strife: the righteous, if they are at the same time &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), are doubly worthy and in need of his help. Nevertheless another explanation of &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; presents itself, and one that is all the more probable as occurring just in this Psalm which has such a North-Palestinian colouring. The observation, that North-Palestinian writers do not always point the construct state with ath, in favour of which Hitzig, on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a>, wrongly appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-13.htm">Job 39:13</a>, but rightly to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-8.htm">Judges 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-32.htm">Judges 8:32</a> (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Deuteronomy 33:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-27.htm">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>), is perfectly correct. Accordingly &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; may possibly be equivalent to &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, but not in the signification business, affair  equals  &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, parallel with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, but in the signification afflictio (after the form &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-17.htm">Ezekiel 28:17</a>); so that it may be rendered: in order to put a stop to the oppression of righteousness or the suffering of innocence. The jussive &#1493;&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;, like &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>, begins the apodosis of a hypothetical protasis that is virtually there (Ew. 347, b): so shall thy right hand teach thee, i.e., lead thee forth and cause thee to see terrible things, i.e., awe-inspiring deeds.<p>But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a> both summons and desire pass over into the expression of a sure and hopeful prospect and a vision, in which that which is to be is present to the mind: thine arrows are sharpened, and therefore deadly to those whom they hit; peoples shall fall (&#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;)<p>(Note: It is not &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;; for the pause falls upon &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, and the Athnach of &#1497;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493; stands merely in the place of Zekaph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-12.htm">Numbers 6:12</a>). The Athnach after Olewejored does not produce any pausal effect; vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/129-1.htm">Psalm 129:1</a>, and cf. supra, p. 56, note 2.)<p>under thee, i.e., so that thou passest over them as they lie upon the ground; in the heart of the enemies of the king, viz., they (i.e., the arrows) will stick. The harsh ellipse is explained by the fact of the poet having the scene of battle before his mind as though he were an eye-witness of it. The words "in the heart of the king's enemies" are an exclamation accompanied by a pointing with the finger. Thither, he means to say, those sharp arrows fly and smite. Crusius' explanation is similar, but it goes further than is required: apostrophe per prosopopaeiam directa ad sagittas quasi jubens, quo tendere debeant. We are here reminded of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>, where a similar &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; occurs in a prophetico-messianic connection. Moreover, even according to its reference to contemporary history the whole of this strophe sounds Messianic. The poet desires that the king whom he celebrates may rule and triumph after the manner of the Messiah; that he may succour truth and that which is truly good, and overcome the enmity of the world, or, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a> expresses it, that the God-anointed King of Zion may shatter everything that rises up in opposition with an iron sceptre. This anointed One, however, is not only the Son of David, but also of God. He is called absolutely &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;. Isaiah calls Him, even in the cradle, &#1488;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>. We shall not, therefore, find it to be altogether intolerable, if the poet now addresses him as &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, although the picture thus far sketched is thoroughly human in all its ideality. </body></html>
