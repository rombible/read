But whether they supposed the words to be addressed to the Divine Being, or that the theocratic king is thus styled, is uncertain. The Christian use of the verse as applied to the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm" title="But to the Son he said, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.">Hebrews 1:8</a>, Note, <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary</span>) does not help us to explain how the monarch, who is the poet’s theme here, could be addressed as God.

While the Holy Spirit leads Christ's people to look to his cross, he teaches them to see the evil of sin and the beauty of holiness; so that none of them can feel encouragement to continue in sin. The Mediator is God, else he had been neither able to do the Mediator's work, nor fit to wear the Mediator's crown. God the Father, as his God in respect to his human nature and mediatorial offices, has given to him the Holy Spirit without measure. Thus anointed to be a Prophet, Priest, and King, Christ has pre-eminence in the gladdening gifts and graces of the spirit, and from his fulness communicates them to his brethren in human nature. The Spirit is called the oil of gladness, because of the delight wherewith Christ was filled, in carrying on his undertakings. The salvation of sinners is the joy of angels, much more of the Son. And in proportion as we are conformed to his holy image, we may expect the gladdening gifts influences of the Comforter. The excellences of the Messiah, the suitableness of his offices, and the sufficiency of his grace, seem to be intended by the fragrance of his garments. The church formed of true believers, is here compared to the queen, whom, by an everlasting covenant, the Lord Jesus has betrothed to himself. This is the bride, the Lamb's wife, whose graces are compared to fine linen, for their purity; to gold, for their costliness: for as we owe our redemption, so we owe our adorning, to the precious blood of the Son of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever - This passage is quoted by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews in proof that the Messiah is exalted above the angels, and it is, beyond all question, adduced by him as having original reference to the Messiah. See the passage explained at length in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>. I do not perceive, after an interval of nearly twenty years since those notes were written, that it is necessary to alter or to add anything to what is there said in explanation of the passage.

But they are spoken of the Son of God, who is truly and properly God, the true God and eternal life; as appears by the names by which he is called, as Jehovah, and the like; by his having all divine perfections in him; by the works which he has wrought, and by the worship which is given unto him; and to whom dominion is ascribed, of which the throne is an emblem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>. And this his government is either general, over angels, good and bad, and over men, even wicked men, and over the greatest among men, the kings of the earth; or special, over his own church and people, and which is exercised by his Spirit and grace in them; by his word and ordinances among them; and which will be in a glorious manner in the latter day; and in heaven, though not in the same manner as now, and that to all eternity: for to this government duration for ever and ever is attributed; Christ will have no successor, he will die no more; nor can his government be subverted or taken out of his hands, or he be removed from his throne by any of his enemies, or by all of them; and though his kingdom will be delivered up to the Father, it will not cease, it is an everlasting one; <p>the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre; meaning either the Gospel, which is the golden sceptre of mercy and grace, stretched out and held forth for the encouragement of sensible sinners; and is a sceptre of righteousness, as it directs to the righteousness of Christ for justification, and encourages works of righteousness to be done by men: or rather the righteous administration of Christ's government is meant, the sceptre being an emblem of dominion and government, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/45.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thy <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> throne, O God, <i>is</i> for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom <i>is</i> a right sceptre.</span><p>(e) Under this figure of this kingdom of justice is set forth the everlasting kingdom of Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/45.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Thy throne</span>, <span class="ital">O God,</span> is <span class="ital">for ever and ever</span>] (1) This appears to be the sense given by all the Ancient Versions, for though it has been argued that <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεὸς</span> in the LX X is not the vocative (<span class="ital">Thy throne O God</span>) but the predicate (<span class="ital">Thy throne is God</span>), the words do not appear to have been so understood by any of the ancient commentators, and the construction is certainly not an obvious one. But this rendering involves serious difficulties, whether it is taken as an address to the king or to God. (<span class="ital">a</span>) Can the king who is the subject of the Ps. be addressed as <span class="ital">Elohim</span>, ‘God’? The older expositors, who regarded the Psalm as directly Messianic, of course felt no difficulty, and saw in the words a recognition of the Deity of Christ. But the tone and contents of the Psalm make it clear that it is addressed to some actual king. Could such a king be so addressed? It is argued that judges were called <span class="ital">gods</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm" title="Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-8.htm" title="If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges, to see whether he have put his hand to his neighbor's goods....">Exodus 22:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a>(?); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-25.htm" title="If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they listened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.">1 Samuel 2:25</a>); that the theocratic king as the representative of God was said to sit “on the throne of Jehovah” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm" title="And of all my sons, (for the LORD has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-23.htm" title="Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>); that a prophet can predict that the house of David should be <span class="ital">as God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-8.htm" title="In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.">Zechariah 12:8</a>); that <span class="ital">Elohim</span> is applied to men in the sense of divine or supernatural (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.">Exodus 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-13.htm" title="And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.">1 Samuel 28:13</a>); that Isaiah speaks of the Messianic king as <span class="ital">El gibbôr</span>, ‘mighty God’; and that the words of the next verse (where doubtless <span class="ital">Jehovah thy God</span> originally stood) preclude the possibility of misunderstanding. But it is doubtful whether judges are actually called <span class="ital">gods</span> (see R.V. of the passage quoted): certainly they are only so called as the mouthpieces of God, Who is regarded as the fountain of judgement: and after all that has been urged in favour of this interpretation it seems hardly possible to suppose that the king is directly addressed as <span class="ital">Elohim</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) The Targum regards the words as addressed to Jehovah, ‘The throne of Thy majesty, O Jehovah, abideth for ever and ever.’ Jehovah’s throne may mean His heavenly throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-13.htm" title="Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures throughout all generations.">Psalm 145:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-19.htm" title="You, O LORD, remain for ever; your throne from generation to generation.">Lamentations 5:19</a>), or the throne which He has established on earth as its counterpart and representative. But this interpretation seems to be excluded by the context. The king is addressed in the preceding and following verses, and it seems hardly possible to suppose that in this verse alone Jehovah is abruptly addressed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) In view of these difficulties it is necessary to consider whether the words are correctly translated. Various other renderings have been proposed, taking <span class="ital">Elohim</span> as the subject or predicate of the clause instead of as a vocative. (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">God is thy throne:</span> i.e. thy kingdom is founded upon God. In support of this are quoted such phrases as “Jehovah is my refuge and my fortress” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-2.htm" title="I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.">Psalm 91:2</a>), or, “The eternal God is thy dwelling-place” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-27.htm" title="The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before you; and shall say, Destroy them.">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>). But the expression, to say the least, would be a strange one. (<span class="ital">b</span>) <span class="ital">Thy throne is God</span>, i.e. divine. But though Hebrew uses substantives as predicates in a way which our idiom does not allow, this particular instance seems scarcely admissible. (<span class="ital">c</span>) <span class="ital">Thy throne</span> [is the throne of] <span class="ital">God</span> (R.V. marg.). It is a disputed point whether this rendering is grammatically legitimate; but good authorities decide in the affirmative. It gives an excellent sense, and if the text is to be retained is the most satisfactory explanation of it. The theocratic king occupied the earthly throne of Jehovah as His representative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm" title="And of all my sons, (for the LORD has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-23.htm" title="Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>), ruling by His power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-28.htm" title="And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.">1 Kings 3:28</a>), and in His Name; and the justice of this king’s government (6 <span class="ital">b</span>, 7) stamps him as a worthy representative of Jehovah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) Various emendations have been suggested, for the most part introducing a verb to give the sense, <span class="ital">God hath established thy throne</span>. The most ingenious is that of Bruston, who supposes that the Elohistic editor misread YHVH, <span class="ital">Jehovah</span>, for YHYH, <span class="ital">shall be</span>, and according to his usual custom substituted <span class="ital">Elohim</span>. <span class="ital">Thy throne shall be for ever and ever</span> would be an echo of the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.">2 Samuel 7:16</a> <span class="ital">b</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whatever may be the precise rendering, there can be little doubt that the words contain a reference to the promise of eternal dominion to the house of David, which was fulfilled in Christ. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm" title="He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.">2 Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; Psalms 89; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm" title="He asked life of you, and you gave it him, even length of days for ever and ever.">Psalm 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm" title="They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.">Psalm 72:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/45-6.htm" title="Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of your kingdom is a right scepter...."><span class="ital">Psalm 45:6-7</a></span> are quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-8.htm" title="But to the Son he said, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom....">Hebrews 1:8-9</a>. “It is commonly supposed that the force of the quotation lies in the Divine title (<span class="greekheb">ὁ θεός</span>) which, as it is held, is applied to the Son. It seems however from the whole form of the argument to lie rather in the description which is given of the Son’s office and endowment. The angels are subject to constant change, He has a dominion for ever and ever; they work through material powers, He—the Incarnate Son—fulfils a moral sovereignty and is crowned with unique joy. Nor could the reader forget the later teaching of the Psalm on the Royal Bride and the Royal Race. In whatever way then <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεός</span> be taken, the quotation establishes the conclusion which the writer wishes to draw as to the essential difference of the Son and the angels.” Bp. Westcott <span class="ital">in loc</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the sceptre</span> &c.] R.V. rightly, A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

So the LXX., the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>), the Chaldee paraphrase, and, among critics, Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Alexander, and Canon Cook. The renderings proposed by Gesenius, Ewald, and the anti-Messianic school generally are wholly untenable, as Hengstenberg has clearly shown. The psalmist's intention is to address the King, whom he has already declared to be more than man (ver. 2), as "God." <span class="cmt_word">Is for ever and ever</span>. A dominion to which there will never be any end. This is never said, and could not be truly said, of any earthly kingdom. When perpetuity is promised to the throne of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4, 36, 37</a>), it is to that throne as continued in the reign of David's Son, Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">sceptre of rectitude</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-4.htm">Psalm 67:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 44:23-27) The church is not conscious of any apostasy, for on the contrary it is suffering for the sake of its fidelity. Such is the meaning intended by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>). The emphasis lies on &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, which is used exactly as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a>. Paul, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-36.htm">Romans 8:36</a>, transfers this utterance to the sufferings of the New Testament church borne in witnessing for the truth, or I should rather say he considers it as a divine utterance corresponding as it were prophetically to the sufferings of the New Testament church, and by anticipation, coined concerning it and for its use, inasmuch as he cites it with the words &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. The suppliant cries &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; and &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492; are Davidic, and found in his earlier Ps; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-7.htm">Psalm 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65</a>. God is said to sleep when He does not interpose in whatever is taking place in the outward world here below; for the very nature of sleep is a turning in into one's own self from all relationship to the outer world, and a resting of the powers which act outwardly. The writer of our Psalm is fond of couplets of synonyms like &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1500;&#1495;&#1510;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-25.htm">Psalm 44:25</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>, &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1498;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-25.htm">Psalm 119:25</a> is an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-26.htm">Psalm 44:26</a>. The suppliant cry &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (in this instance in connection with the &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492; which follows, it is to be accented on the ultima) is Davidic, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-7.htm">Psalm 7:7</a>; but originally it is Mosaic.
