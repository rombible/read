The scope of it is to convince us of our sins. God, by the psalmist, here shows us how bad we are, and proves this by his own certain knowledge. He speaks terror to persecutors, the worst of sinners. He speaks encouragement to God's persecuted people. How comes it that men are so bad? Because there is no fear of God before their eyes. Men's bad practices flow from their bad principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, because in thoughts, they deny him. See the folly of sin; he is a fool, in the account of God, whose judgment we are sure is right, that harbours such corrupt thoughts. And see the fruit of sin; to what it brings men, when their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. See also the faith of the saints, and their hope and power as to the cure of this great evil. There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. God will save his church from its enemies. He will save all believers from their own sins, that they may not be led captive by them, which will be everlasting joy to them. From this work the Redeemer had his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins, Mt 1:21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/53.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>. The only change in this verse is in the omission of the word "all." This word, as it occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a> ("all the workers of iniquity"), makes the sentence stronger and more emphatic. It is designed to affirm in the most absolute and unqualified manner that none of these workers of iniquity had any true knowledge of God. This has been noticed by critics as the only instance in which the expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a> is stronger than in the revised form of the psalm before us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/53.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 53<p>Ps 53:1-6.

God is the speaker. The first clause may be taken as in A.V., ‘Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?’ Are they so ignorant that they cannot distinguish between right and wrong?

For this pregnant sense of <span class="ital">know</span> cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm" title="The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of your iniquity, and the great hatred.">Hosea 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-16.htm" title="And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.">Jdg 8:16</a> (<span class="ital">taught</span>, lit. <span class="ital">made to know</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who eat up</span> &c.] The A.V. follows the Ancient Versions in understanding this to mean, ‘they devour my people as naturally as they take their daily food.’ And this they do without regard to God (in Psalms 14, Jehovah). Cp. for the phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm" title="Only rebel not you against the LORD, neither fear you the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.">Numbers 14:9</a>, “the people of the land are bread for us”; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm" title="God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.">Numbers 24:8</a>; and for the fact, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm" title="Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.">Isaiah 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm" title="Pour out your fury on the heathen that know you not, and on the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.">Jeremiah 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-16.htm" title="Therefore all they that devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil you shall be a spoil, and all that prey on you will I give for a prey.">Jeremiah 30:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm" title="You did strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.">Habakkuk 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-7.htm" title="For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.">Psalm 79:7</a>.

The &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; is not, as one might suppose, the holy tent or tabernacle, that he has desecrated by making it the lurking-place of the betrayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-7.htm">1 Samuel 21:7</a>), which would have been expressed by &#1502;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;, but his own dwelling. God will pull him, the lofty and imperious one, down (&#1504;&#1514;&#1509;, like a tower perhaps, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-9.htm">Judges 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-9.htm">Ezekiel 26:9</a>) from his position of honour and his prosperity, and drag him forth out of his habitation, much as one rakes a coal from the hearth (&#1495;&#1514;&#1492; Biblical and Talmudic in this sense), and tear him out of this his home (&#1504;&#1505;&#1495;, cf. &#1504;&#1514;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-14.htm">Job 18:14</a>) and remove him far away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>), because he has betrayed the homeless fugitive; and will root him out of the land of the living, because he has destroyed the priests of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>). It then proceeds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a> very much like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>, just as the figure of the razor also coincides with Psalms belonging to exactly the same period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>, cf. &#1500;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>). The excitement and indignant anger against one's foes which expresses itself in the rhythm and the choice of words, has been already recognised by us since <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a> as a characteristic of these Psalms. The hope which David, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>, attaches to God's judicial interposition is the same as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a>. The righteous will be strengthened in the fear of God (for the play of sounds cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>) and laugh at him whom God has overthrown, saying: Behold there the man, etc. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-11.htm">Psalm 58:11</a>, the laughing is joy at the ultimate breaking through of justice long hidden and not discerned; for even the moral teaching of the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>) reprobates the low malignant joy that glories at the overthrow of one's enemy. By &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; the former trust in mammon on the part of the man who is overtaken by punishment is set forth as a consequence of his refusal to put trust in God, in Him who is the true &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;  equals  Arab. m&#8219;a&#770;d&#817;, hiding-place or place of protection (vid., on 31;3, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-39.htm">Psalm 37:39</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-33.htm">Psalm 22:33</a>). &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is here the passion for earthly things which rushes at and falls upon them (animo fertur). </body></html>
