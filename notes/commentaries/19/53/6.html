The scope of it is to convince us of our sins. God, by the psalmist, here shows us how bad we are, and proves this by his own certain knowledge. He speaks terror to persecutors, the worst of sinners. He speaks encouragement to God's persecuted people. How comes it that men are so bad? Because there is no fear of God before their eyes. Men's bad practices flow from their bad principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, because in thoughts, they deny him. See the folly of sin; he is a fool, in the account of God, whose judgment we are sure is right, that harbours such corrupt thoughts. And see the fruit of sin; to what it brings men, when their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. See also the faith of the saints, and their hope and power as to the cure of this great evil. There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. God will save his church from its enemies. He will save all believers from their own sins, that they may not be led captive by them, which will be everlasting joy to them. From this work the Redeemer had his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins, Mt 1:21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/53.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Oh that the salvation of Israel ... - The only change here from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm">Psalm 14:7</a> is that the word &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'Elohiym, God, is substituted for "Jehovah," Lord, and that the word rendered "salvation" is here in the plural. On the supposition that the psalm was adapted to a state of things when the city had been besieged, and the enemy discomfited, this language would express the deep and earnest desire of the people that the Lord would grant deliverance. Perhaps it may be supposed, also, that at the time of such a siege, and while the Lord interposed to save them from the siege, it was also true that there was some general danger hanging over the people; that even the nation might be described as in some sense "captive;" or that some portions of the land were subject to a foreign power. The desire expressed is, that the deliverance might be complete, and that the whole land might be brought to the possession of liberty, and be rescued from all foreign domination. That time, when it should arrive, would be the occasion of universal rejoicing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/53.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Instead of assurances of God's presence with the pious, and a complaint of the wicked, Ps 14:5, 6 portrays the ruin of the latter, whose "bones" even "are scattered" (compare Ps 141:7), and who are put to shame as contemptuously rejected of God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/53.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/53.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!.... Or, "who will give (f) out of Zion the salvation of Israel?" The Targum adds, "except the Lord"; and this is a request to him for it: and, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm">Psalm 14:7</a>, it may be a wish for the first coming of Christ, to work out salvation for his people; here it may be expressive of the desire of the church for his coming in a spiritual manner, in the latter day, to take to himself his great power, and reign; to destroy antichrist, and deliver his people from bondage and oppression by him; when the Gentiles shall be gathered in, the Jews will be converted, and all Israel saved; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>. It is in the original text, "salvations" (g); denoting the complete salvation of the church; when all her enemies will be destroyed, and all peace and prosperity shall be enjoyed by her; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-6.htm">Psalm 14:6</a>. <p>when God bringeth back the captivity of his people: who have been carried into it by antichrist, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-10.htm">Revelation 13:10</a>; <p>Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad; for now the kingdoms of this world will become Christ's; the marriage of the Lamb will be come, and the bride made ready, through the calling of the Gentiles, and the conversion of the Jews; which will occasion the twenty four elders, the representatives of the Christian church, to give thanks to the Lord God Almighty, and cause many voices to be heard in heaven, expressing great joy on this occasion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>. <p>(f)  "quis dabit", V.

Concluding prayer for the full restoration of Israel. Some commentators have regarded this as a liturgical addition, but its presence in both recensions is in favour of its originality.

For <span class="ital">God</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 14:7</a> has <span class="ital">Jehovah</span>. At first sight these words seem to fix the date of the Psalm in the period of the Exile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-1.htm" title="When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.">Psalm 126:1</a>). Nor does the phrase <span class="ital">out of Zion</span> exclude such a view. The exiles turned to Zion even in her desolation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-44.htm" title="If your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever you shall send them, and shall pray to the LORD toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house that I have built for your name:">1 Kings 8:44</a>), and from thence Jehovah might be expected to restore His people. But (1) it is very probable that the phrase rendered <span class="ital">bring back the captivity</span> means rather <span class="ital">turn the fortunes</span>[26]. This meaning suits all the passages in which the phrase occurs, while <span class="ital">turn the captivity</span> does not, except in the figurative sense of <span class="ital">restoring prosperity</span>. See e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-10.htm" title="And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.">Job 42:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-53.htm" title="When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of your captives in the middle of them:">Ezekiel 16:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-7.htm" title="And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.">Zephaniah 2:7</a>. And (2) even if <span class="ital">turn the captivity</span> is the original meaning, the phrase is used by Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-14.htm" title="And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.">Amos 9:14</a>) and Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-11.htm" title="Also, O Judah, he has set an harvest for you, when I returned the captivity of my people.">Hosea 6:11</a>) long before the Babylonian Captivity.

The betrayer becomes like an uprooted tree; the betrayed, however, stands firm and is like to a green-foliaged olive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>) which is planted in the house of Elohim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a>), that is to say, in sacred and inaccessible ground; cf. the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>. The weighty expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514; refers, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>, to the gracious and just carrying out of that which was aimed at in the election of David. If this be attained, then he will for ever give thanks and further wait on the Name, i.e., the self-attestation, of God, which is so gracious and kind, he will give thanks and "wait" in the presence of all the saints. This "waiting," &#1493;&#1488;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, is open to suspicion, since what he intends to do in the presence of the saints must be something that is audible or visible to them. Also "hoping in the name of God" is, it is true, not an unbiblical notional combination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a>); but in connection with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; &#1499;&#1497; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; which follows, one more readily looks for a verb expressing a thankful and laudatory proclamation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-8.htm">Psalm 54:8</a>). Hitzig's conjecture that we should read &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is therefore perfectly satisfactory. &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; does not belong to &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, which would be construed with &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; htiw deurtsnoc , and not &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, but to the two votive words; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-26.htm">Psalm 22:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/138-1.htm">Psalm 138:1</a>, and other passages. The whole church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>.) shall be witness of his thankfulness to God, and of his proclamation of the proofs which God Himself has given of His love and favour. </body></html>
