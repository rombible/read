The scope of it is to convince us of our sins. God, by the psalmist, here shows us how bad we are, and proves this by his own certain knowledge. He speaks terror to persecutors, the worst of sinners. He speaks encouragement to God's persecuted people. How comes it that men are so bad? Because there is no fear of God before their eyes. Men's bad practices flow from their bad principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, because in thoughts, they deny him. See the folly of sin; he is a fool, in the account of God, whose judgment we are sure is right, that harbours such corrupt thoughts. And see the fruit of sin; to what it brings men, when their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. See also the faith of the saints, and their hope and power as to the cure of this great evil. There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. God will save his church from its enemies. He will save all believers from their own sins, that they may not be led captive by them, which will be everlasting joy to them. From this work the Redeemer had his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins, Mt 1:21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/53.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fool hath said in his heart ... - For the meaning of this verse, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>.

And this he does because he is a fool. Being a fool he speaks according to his nature; being a great fool he meddles with a great subject, and comes to a wild conclusion. The atheist is, morally, as well as mentally, a fool, a fool in the heart as well as in the head; a fool in morals as well as in philosophy. With the denial of God as a starting point, we may well conclude that the fool's progress is a rapid, riotous, raving, ruinous one. He who begins at impiety is ready for anything. "No God," being interpreted, means no law, no order, no restraint to lust, no limit to passion. Who but a fool would be of this mind? What a Bedlam, or rather what an Aceldama, would the world become if such lawless principles came to be universal! He who heartily entertains an irreligious spirit, and follows it out to its legitimate issues is a son of Belial, dangerous to the commonwealth, irrational and despicable. Every natural man, is, more or less a denier of God. Practical atheism is the religion of the race. "Corrupt are they." They are rotten. It is idle to compliment them as sincere doubters, and amiable thinkers - they are putrid. There is too much dainty dealing nowadays with atheism; it is not a harmless error, it is an offensive, putrid sin, and righteous men should look upon it in that light. All men being more or less atheistic in spirit, are also in that degree corrupt; their heart is foul, their moral nature is decayed. "And have done abominable iniquity." Bad principles soon lead to bad lives. One does not find virtue promoted by the example of your Voltaires and Tom Paines. Those who talk so abominably as to deny their Maker will act abominably when it serves their turn. It is the abounding denial and forgetfulness of God among men which is the source of the unrighteousness and crime which we see around us. If all men are not outwardly vicious it is to be accounted for by the power of other and better principles, but left to itself the "No God" spirit so universal in mankind would produce nothing but the most loathsome actions. - "There is none that doeth good." The one typical fool is reproduced in the whole race; without a single exception men have forgotten the right way. This accusation twice made in the Psalm, and repeated a third time by the inspired apostle Paul, is an indictment most solemn and sweeping, but he who makes it cannot err, he knows what is in man; neither will he lay more to man's charge than he can prove.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-2.htm">Psalm 53:2</a><p>"God looked down from heaven upon the children of men." He did so in ages past, and he has continued his steadfast gaze from his all-surveying observatory. "To see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God." Had there been one understanding man, one true lover of his God, the divine eye would have discovered him. Those pure heathens and admirable savages that men talk so much of, do not appear to have been visible to the eye of Omniscience, the fact being that they live nowhere but in the realm of fiction. The Lord did not look for great grace, but only for sincerity and right desire, but these he found not. He saw all nations, and all men in all nations, and all hearts in all men, and all motions of all hearts, but he saw neither a clear head nor a clean heart among them all. Where God's eyes see no favourable sign we may rest assured there is none.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-3.htm">Psalm 53:3</a><p>"Every one of them is gone back." The whole mass of manhood, all of it, is gone back. In thePsa 14:1-7 it was said to turn aside, which was bad enough, but here it is described as running in a diametrically opposite direction. The life of unregenerate manhood is in direct defiance of the law of God, not merely apart from it but opposed to it. "They are altogether become filthy." The whole lump is soured with an evil leaven, fouled with an all-pervading pollution, made rank with general putrefaction. Thus, in God's sight, our atheistic nature is not the pardonable thing that we think it to be. Errors as to God are not the mild diseases which some account them, they are abominable evils. Fair is the world to blind eyes, but to the all-seeing Jehovah it is otherwise. "There is none that doeth good, no, not one." How could there be, when the whole mass was leavened with so evil a leaven? This puts an end to the fictions of the innocent savage, the lone patriarch, "the Indian whose untutored mind," etc. Pope's verse - <p>Father of all, in every age,<p>In every clime adored,<p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm, some few words excepted, is wholly the same with <span class="bld">Psalm 14</span>, and therefore the reader must resort thither for the interpretation of it.

Doeg, who causes a massacre, not, however, by the strength of his hand, but by the cunning of his tongue, does this.

David's cause, however, is not therefore lost; for it is the cause of God, whose loving-kindness endures continually, without allowing itself to be affected, like the favour of men, by calumny.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a> &#1512;&#1506; after &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; has the Dagesh that is usual also in other instances according to the rule of the &#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;, especially in connection with the letters &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1489;&#1490;&#1491; (with which Resh is associated in the Book of Jezira, Michlol 96b, cf. 63b).<p>(Note: &#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511; is the name by which the national grammarians designate a group of two words, of which the first, ending with Kametz or Segol, has the accent on the penult., and of which the second is a monosyllable, or likewise is accented on the penult. The initial consonant of the second word in this case receives a Dagesh, in order that it may not, in consequence of the first ictus of the group of words "coming out of the distance," i.e., being far removed, be too feebly and indistinctly uttered. This dageshing, however, only takes place when the first word is already of itself Milel, or at least, as e.g., &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, had a half-accented penult., and not when it is from the very first Milra and is only become Milel by means of the retreating of the accent, as &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>. The penultima-accent has a greater lengthening force in the former case than in the latter; the following syllables are therefore uttered more rapidly in the first case, and the Dagesh is intended to guard against the third syllable being too hastily combined with the second. Concerning the rule, vid., Baer's Thorath Emeth, p. 29f.)<p>The &#1502;&#1503; or &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; and &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is not meant to affirm that he loves good, etc., less than evil, etc., but that he does not love it at all (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>). The music which comes in after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a> has to continue the accusations con amarezza without words. Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a> the singing again takes them up, by addressing the adversary with the words "thou tongue of deceit" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a>), and by reproaching him with loving only such utterances as swallow up, i.e., destroy without leaving a trace behind (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;, pausal form of &#1489;&#1500;&#1506;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-36.htm">Psalm 119:36</a>, cf. the verb in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-25.htm">Psalm 35:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-16.htm">2 Samuel 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a>.), his neighbour's life and honour and goods. Hupfeld takes <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a> as a second object; but the figurative and weaker expression would then follow the unfigurative and stronger one, and "to love a deceitful tongue" might be said with reference to this character of tongue as belonging to another person, not with reference to his own. </body></html>
