The meaning probably is, that they were insignificant and inconsiderable as to power, the fewness of their number being mentioned just before. <span class="ital">And strangers in it — </span>Such were the patriarchs in the land of Canaan. <span class="ital">They went from one nation to another — </span>Both in Canaan, where there were seven nations, and in Egypt. <span class="ital">He reproved kings for their sakes — </span>Both verbally, and by his judgments. <span class="ital">Saying, Touch not — Hurt not, </span>as the word <span class="greekheb">נגע</span>, <span class="ital">nagang, </span>is often used; <span class="ital">mine anointed — </span>My prophets, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are called God’s <span class="ital">anointed, </span>because they were eminently blessed of God, replenished with the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, in respect of which many persons are said, in the Scriptures, to be anointed, who never had any material oil applied to them; and because they were thus consecrated to be his peculiar people, and to be kings and priests in their families. And they are called <span class="ital">prophets, </span>because God familiarly conversed with them, and revealed his will to them, and by them to others.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/105.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>105:8-23 Let us remember the Redeemer's marvellous works, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth. Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When they were but a few men in number - literally, "In their being people of number, very little." That is, They could then be easily numbered, and they were so few that they could not take possession of it themselves. This is in contrast with the promise then made to them that they should be in number as the stars, and as the sand on the sea shore.<p>And strangers in it - Foreigners. They were mere sojourners. They did not become incorporated with the people of the land. They did not acquire property there. They were regarded and treated as belonging to a foreign people.

Or "men of number" (d), that might easily be numbered; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>, when this covenant, promise, and oath, were first made to Abraham, he was alone, and had no child; and when his posterity were increased in Jacob's time, and sojourned in Egypt, they were but few, though greatly enlarged when they came out of it: in comparison of other nations, they were the fewest of all people, and therefore had this grant of Canaan, not for their numbers any more than their goodness. And this circumstance is mentioned to show the unmerited goodness of God unto them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>. And so the Lord's people, to whom he gives the kingdom of heaven, are a little flock; they are only a few that find the way to eternal life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>. <p>Yea, very few; or "as a little thing" (e): so were the people of Israel a little contemptible body of men in the eyes of others, and in comparison of them. And such are the saints in this world; "the filth of it", and the "offscouring of all things"; <p>yea, things that are not; that scarce deserve, in the opinion of men, to be reckoned entities or beings. And strangers in it; as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9</a>, and so are the people of God, who are the heirs of the heavenly Canaan. These are strangers to the men of the world, who know them not; and the men of the world to them; with whom they have no conversation and fellowship in things sinful and criminal; for which they late despised by the world: yet these are the fellow citizens of heaven, and of the household of God, which shows his discriminating grace. <p>(d)  "viros numeri", Montanus; so Vatablus, Gejerus, Michaelis.
