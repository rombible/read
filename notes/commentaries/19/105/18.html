The grammar of the clause does not decide its sense with certainty; for its syntax is rather in favour of the Prayer Book Version, though the feminine form of the verb makes in favour of the marginal rendering. Symmachus has, “his soul came into iron;” the LXX., “his soul passed through iron.” The Vulg., however, has the other Version, “the iron passed through his soul”—first found in the Targum. The parallelism is in favour of the Authorised Version.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/105.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>105:8-23 Let us remember the Redeemer's marvellous works, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth. Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whose feet they hurt with fetters - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-3.htm">Genesis 40:3</a>; it is said of Joseph that he was "bound" in prison. It is not improbable that his "feet" were bound, as this is the usual way of confining prisoners.<p>He was laid in iron - In the prison. The margin is, "his soul came into iron." The version in the Prayer-Book of the Episcopal Church is, the iron entered into his soul. This is a more striking and beautiful rendering, though it may be doubted whether the Hebrew will permit it. DeWette renders it, "In iron lay his body." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/105.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. hurt with fetters&#8212;(Ge 40:3).<p>was laid in iron&#8212;literally, "his soul" (see on [631]Ps 16:10), or, "he came into iron," or, he was bound to his grief (compare Ps 3:2; 11:1). The "soul" is put for the whole person, because the soul of the captive suffers still more than the body. Joseph is referred to as being an appropriate type of those "bound in affliction and iron" (Ps 107:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/105.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Heb. <span class="ital">his soul came into iron</span>; which seems to be added emphatically to aggravate his imprisonment, and to show how grievous it was to his very soul, which must needs sympathize with his body, and moreover was greatly vexed to consider both the great injury which was done to him, and yet the foul and public scandal which lay upon him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/105.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whose feet they hurt with fetters,.... For it seems Joseph was not only cast into prison, upon the calumny of his mistress; but had fetters put upon him, and his feet were made fast with them; and these were so close and heavy, as to pinch and gall and hurt him; which, though not mentioned in his history, was undoubtedly true; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20</a>. <p>He was laid in iron: or "the iron" (or, as the Targum, "the iron chain") "went into his Soul" (f); his body; it ate into him, and gave him great pain: or rather, as it is in the king's Bible, "his soul went into the iron chain"; there being, as Aben Ezra observes, an ellipsis of the particle  and which is supplied by Symmachus, and so in the Targum; that is, his body was enclosed in iron bands, so Buxtorf (g). In all this he was a type of Christ, whose soul was made exceeding sorrowful unto death: he was seized by the Jews, led bound to the high priest, fastened to the cursed tree, pierced with nails, and more so with the sins of his people he bore; and was laid in the prison of the grave; from whence and from judgment he was brought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>. <p>(f) So Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus.

He keenly felt the degradation and suffering of his unjust imprisonment. Thus the sense is substantially the same as that of the picturesque rendering of the P.B.V. which has passed into a proverbial phrase, “the iron entered into his soul[58].” This rendering, which is that of the Targ. and Vulg.[59], is defended by Delitzsch and others, but is questionable for grammatical reasons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[58] Coverdale’s original rendering (1535) was,<span class="ital"> the yron pearsed his herte</span>.

"Men of number" are such as can be easily counted, vid., the confessions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; places the claim upon the hospitality at one time of this people and at another time of that people in the connection with it of cause and effect. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, as a small number, only such a small number, signifies, as being virtually an adjective: inconsiderable, insignificant, worthless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-20.htm">Proverbs 10:20</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers to Canaan. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-13.htm">Psalm 105:13</a> the way in which the words &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; and &#1506;&#1501; alternate is instructive: the former signifies the nation, bound together by a common origin, language, country, and descent; the latter the people, bound together by unity of government.<p>(Note: For this reason a king says &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, not &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; only occurs twice with a suffix, which refers to Jahve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-5.htm">Psalm 106:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>); for this reason &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, frequently side by side with &#1506;&#1501;, is the nobler word, e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>; for this reason &#1506;&#1501; is frequently added to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; as a dignitative predicate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; and for this reason &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1501; &#1492; are used antithetically.)<p>The apodosis does not begin until <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14</a>. It is different in connection with &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; in the text of the chronicler, and in this passage in the Psalter of the Syriac version, according to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-12.htm">Psalm 105:12</a> ought to be jointed to the preceding group. The variation &#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; instead of &#1502;&#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; is of no consequence; but &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (to any one whomsoever) instead of &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, in connection with &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;, restores the current mode of expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-11.htm">2 Samuel 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>) instead of one which is without support elsewhere, but which follows the model of &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, &#1504;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-28.htm">Genesis 31:28</a> (cf. supra p. 171); whilst on the other hand &#1493;&#1489;&#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; instead of &#1493;&#1500;&#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; substitutes an expression that cannot be supported for the current one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-9.htm">Genesis 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-21.htm">Ruth 1:21</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14</a> the poet has the three histories of the preservation of the wives of the patriarchs in his mind, viz., of Sarah in Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>), and of Sarah and of Rebekah both in Philistia (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1-9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1-12</a>, cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-11.htm">Psalm 26:11</a>). In the second instance God declares the patriarch to be a "prophet" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The one mention has reference to this and the other to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>, where Abram is set apart to be the father of peoples and kings, and Sarai to be a princess. They are called &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (a passive form) as eing God-chosen princes, and &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (an intensive active form, from &#1504;&#1489;&#1488;, root &#1504;&#1489;, to divulge), not as being inspired ones (Hupfeld), but as being God's spokesmen (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-15.htm">Exodus 4:15</a>.), therefore as being the recipients and mediators of a divine revelation. </body></html>
