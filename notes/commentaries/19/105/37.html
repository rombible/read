In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35</a>, it is said, in our translation, that they had "borrowed" this gold and silver, together with raiment, of the Egyptians. This is an unhappy translation, as our word "borrow" means to ask anything of another for the purpose of using it for a time, with an implied understanding that it shall be returned, if an article to be used - or that as much money shall be repaid, if it is money that is borrowed - and according to this there would have been dishonesty and fraud on the part of the Israelites in "borrowing" these things of the Egyptians, when not intending (as they evidently did not) to return them. The Hebrew word, however, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35</a> - &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;  sha&#770;'al - means merely to ask, "to demand, to require, to request, to perition, to beg." The idea of an obligation to "return" the things, as in our word "borrow," is not attached to the Hebrew word.<p>And there was not one feeble person ... - literally, Not one who was lame; or, who halted, or staggered. This, of course, is not necessarily to be understood literally. It is a general description of the capability of the people for traveling, or for war. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/105.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37. with silver and gold&#8212;presented them by the Egyptians, as an acknowledgment due for their labors in their bondage (compare Ex 12:35).<p>one feeble person&#8212;or, "stumbler," unfit for the line of march.

That is, God brought forth the Israelites out of Egypt by means of the above plagues, laden with great riches, with jewels of gold and of silver, which they borrowed of the Egyptians at the command of the Lord; and so to be justified in what they did; and besides it was but just and equitable that they should be paid for their service and hard labour in Egypt for a long course of time; and this was the method in Providence they were directed to take to do themselves justice; and hereby was accomplished an ancient prophecy concerning them, that they should come out with much substance, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>, Besides, in the passages quoted, the words should be rendered of the Israelites that they "asked", and of the Egyptians that they "gave"; the Jews, some of them, say (c) that these were given not with the will of the Egyptians, and others say not with the will of the Israelites, but neither of them true. And so in like manner will the people of God, when rescued from the tyranny of the antichristian states, enjoy great riches and honour; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a>. <p>And there was not one feeble person among their tribes; though there were six hundred thousand footmen, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21</a>, and though they had been used to hard and rigorous service in order to weaken their strength; and though they came from among a people plagued with diseases and deaths. This confronts a lying story told by some Heathen writers (d), that the Israelites were driven out of Egypt because they had the itch, leprosy, and other diseases upon them. Aben Ezra and Kimchi interpret it, there was not a poor or necessitous man among them, for they abounded with gold and silver; compare with this the case of God's people in the latter day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-8.htm">Zechariah 12:8</a>. <p>(c) T.

It was indirectly God's work, inasmuch as He gave increasing might to His people, which excited their jealousy. The craft reached its highest pitch in the weakening of the Israelites that was aimed at by killing all the male children that were born. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; signifies facts, instances, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>. Here, too, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, the miraculous judgments of the ten plagues to not stand in exactly historical order. The poet begins with the ninth, which was the most distinct self-representation of divine wrath, viz., the darkness (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-29</a>): sha&#772;'lach cho&#772;'shech. The former word (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;) has an orthophonic Gaja by the final syllable, which warns the reader audibly to utter the guttural of the toneless final syllable, which might here be easily slurred over. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498; has its causative signification here, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>; the contracted mode of writing with i instead of &#305;&#770; may be occasioned by the Waw convers. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-28.htm">Psalm 105:28</a> cannot be referred to the Egyptians; for the expression would be a mistaken one for the final compliance, which was wrung from them, and the interrogative way of taking it: nonne rebellarunt, is forced: the cancelling of the &#1500;&#1488;, however (lxx and Syriac), makes the thought halting. Hitzig proposes &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;: they observed not His words; but this, too, sounds flat and awkward when said of the Egyptians. The subject will therefore be the same as the subject of &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;; and of Moses and Aaron, in contrast to the behaviour at Me&#770;-Mer&#305;&#770;bah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-21.htm">1 Kings 13:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-26.htm">1 Kings 13:26</a>), it is said that this time they rebelled not against the words (Ker, without any ground: the word) of God, but executed the terrible commands accurately and willingly. From the ninth plague the poet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-29.htm">Psalm 105:29</a> passes over to the first (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-14.htm">Exodus 7:14-25</a>), viz., the red blood is appended to the black darkness. The second plague follows, viz., the frogs (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1-15</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-20.htm">Psalm 105:20</a> looks as though it were stunted, but neither has the lxx read any &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;), <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-28.htm">Exodus 7:28</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-31.htm">Psalm 105:31</a> he next briefly touches upon the fourth plague, viz., the gad-fly, &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, lxx &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-20.htm">Exodus 8:20-32</a>, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-45.htm">Psalm 78:45</a>), and the third (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-16.htm">Exodus 8:16-19</a>), viz., the gnats, which are passed over in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>. From the third plague the poet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-33.htm">Psalm 105:33</a> takes a leap over to the seventh, viz., the hail (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-13.htm">Exodus 9:13-35</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a> he has <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-24.htm">Exodus 9:24</a> before his mind, according to which masses of fire descended with the hail; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-33.htm">Psalm 105:33</a> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>) he fills in the details of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-25.htm">Exodus 9:25</a>. The seventh plague is followed by the eighth in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-35.htm">Psalm 105:35</a>, viz., the locust (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1-20</a>), to which &#1497;&#1500;&#1511; (the grasshopper) is the parallel word here, just as &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; (the cricket) is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-46.htm">Psalm 78:46</a>. The expression of innumerableness is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>. The fifth plague, viz., the pestilence, murrain (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1-7</a>), and the sixth, viz., &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503;, boils (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-8.htm">Exodus 9:8-12</a>), are left unmentioned; and the tenth plague closes, viz., the smiting of the first-born (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1</a>.), which <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-36.htm">Psalm 105:36</a> expresses in the Asaphic language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-51.htm">Psalm 78:51</a>. Without any mention of the institution of the Passover, the tenth plague is followed by the departure with the vessels of silver and gold asked for from the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-2.htm">Exodus 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>). The Egyptians were glad to get rid of the people whose detention threatened them with total destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-33.htm">Exodus 12:33</a>). The poet here draws from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-27.htm">Isaiah 5:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-13.htm">Isaiah 63:13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>. The suffix of &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1493; refers to the chief subject of the assertion, viz., to God, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/122-4.htm">Psalm 122:4</a>, although manifestly enough the reference to Israel is also possible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>). </body></html>
