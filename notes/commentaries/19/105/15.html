Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Saying, Touch not mine anointed - That is, This was the language of his "providence." It was as though God had said this. It is not meant that this was said in so many words, but this is the "poetic" form of representing the dealings of Providence. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-11.htm">Genesis 26:11</a>. The word "anointed" here means that God had, as it were, set them apart to his service, or that they were to him as kings, and priests, and prophets, sacred people, belonging to God. The "language" is not found in the Old Testament as applied to the patriarchs, but the "idea" is fairly implied there, that they belonged to God as sacred and holy men.<p>And do my prophets no harm - As if God had thus spoken to them, and called them prophets. That is, they belonged to God as a sacred order: they were separate from other men, and God regarded them as his own. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/105.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Or, "mine anointed ones"; my Christs, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were, who, though not anointed with material oil, yet were all that, that such were, who in later times were anointed with it. They were prophets, priests, and kings; and which all met in one person, particularly in Abraham, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>, besides, they were anointed with the oil of grace, with an unction from the Holy One, with the Holy Ghost, and his gifts and graces, as all true believers are: they are the Lord's Christs, or his anointed ones; which stand before him, and have the name of Christians from hence. These the Lord will not have touched, so as to be hurt; they are sacred persons: they are near unto God, in union with him; <p>and he that toucheth him toucheth the apple of his eye; so dear are they to him. <p>And do my prophets no harm; so Abraham is expressly called a prophet, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>, and so were Isaac and Jacob; men to whom the Lord spoke familiarly in dreams and visions, as he used to do with prophets; and who taught and made known the mind and will of God to others, as well as foretold things to come; they being the Lord's servants, his prophets, they were revealed unto them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>.

Jahve is Israel's God: His righteous rule extends over the whole earth, whilst His people experience His inviolable faithfulness to His covenant. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-7.htm">Psalm 105:7</a> is in apposition to &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, for the God who bears this name is as a matter of course the object of the song of praise. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; is the perfect of practically pledges certainty (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>, where we find instead the future of confident prospect). The chronicler has &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; instead (lxx again something different: &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;); but the object is not the demanding but the promissory side of the covenant, so that consequently it is not Israel's remembering but God's that is spoken of. He remembers His covenant in all time to come, so that exile and want of independence as a state are only temporary, exceptional conditions. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; has its radical signification here, to establish, institute, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-9.htm">Psalm 111:9</a>. &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (in which expression &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; is a specifying accusative) is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>. And since &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is the covenant word of promise, it can be continued &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a> (vid., Khler thereon) shows that &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not joined to &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493;, however, is a second object to &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; (since &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; with what belongs to it as an apposition is out of the question). It is the oath on Moriah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>) that is meant, which applied to Abraham and his seed. &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511; (chronicler &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1495;&#1511;), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-26.htm">Jeremiah 33:26</a>. To &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; is appended &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1492;; the suffix, intended as neuter, points to what follows, viz., this, that Canaan shall be Israel's hereditary land. From Abraham and Isaac we come to Jacob-Israel, who as being the father of the twelve is the twelve-tribe nation itself that is coming into existence; hence the plural can alternate with the singular in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503; (chronicler, without the &#1488;&#1514;) is an accusative of the object, and &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; accusative of the predicate: the land of Canaan as the province of your own hereditary possession measured out with a measuring line (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-55.htm">Psalm 78:55</a>). </body></html>
