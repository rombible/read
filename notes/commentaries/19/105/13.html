Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When they went from one nation to another ... - Wandered about, as if they had no home and no fixed habitation.

So Isaac, Jacob, and his posterity, journeyed from one of these kingdoms to the other. Thus the children of God are pilgrims and strangers in this world; they are unsettled in it; they are travelling through it, and a troublesome journey they have of it; they are bound to another country, to which they belong; and their hearts are there beforehand; and they look upon this world as a strange place, and at best but as an inn; where they tarry but for a time, till they get to their own country, the better and heavenly one. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/105.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/105.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">When they went</span> &c.] And (when) they went &c.

Jahve is Israel's God: His righteous rule extends over the whole earth, whilst His people experience His inviolable faithfulness to His covenant. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-7.htm">Psalm 105:7</a> is in apposition to &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, for the God who bears this name is as a matter of course the object of the song of praise. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; is the perfect of practically pledges certainty (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>, where we find instead the future of confident prospect). The chronicler has &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; instead (lxx again something different: &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;); but the object is not the demanding but the promissory side of the covenant, so that consequently it is not Israel's remembering but God's that is spoken of. He remembers His covenant in all time to come, so that exile and want of independence as a state are only temporary, exceptional conditions. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; has its radical signification here, to establish, institute, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-9.htm">Psalm 111:9</a>. &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (in which expression &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; is a specifying accusative) is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>. And since &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is the covenant word of promise, it can be continued &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a> (vid., Khler thereon) shows that &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not joined to &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493;, however, is a second object to &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; (since &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; with what belongs to it as an apposition is out of the question). It is the oath on Moriah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>) that is meant, which applied to Abraham and his seed. &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511; (chronicler &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1495;&#1511;), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-26.htm">Jeremiah 33:26</a>.

From Abraham and Isaac we come to Jacob-Israel, who as being the father of the twelve is the twelve-tribe nation itself that is coming into existence; hence the plural can alternate with the singular in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503; (chronicler, without the &#1488;&#1514;) is an accusative of the object, and &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; accusative of the predicate: the land of Canaan as the province of your own hereditary possession measured out with a measuring line (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-55.htm">Psalm 78:55</a>). </body></html>
