He and only He. The redemption must not be limited to the <span class= "ital">consequences </span>of <span class= "ital">iniquity, </span>though including these. The psalm belongs to the age of true national contrition, when nothing would satisfy but deliverance from sin, as well as from its punishment. This appears decisively from a comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-22.htm" title="Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.">Psalm 25:22</a>, where the expression is “from all his <span class= "ital">troubles.” </span>Thus, this psalm was prepared to be what it has become, one of the penitential psalms of the world.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/130.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>130:5-8 It is for the Lord that my soul waits, for the gifts of his grace, and the working of his power. We must hope for that only which he has promised in his word. Like those who wish to see the dawn, being very desirous that light would come long before day; but still more earnestly does a good man long for the tokens of God's favour, and the visits of his grace. Let all that devote themselves to the Lord, cheerfully stay themselves on him. This redemption is redemption from all sin. Jesus Christ saves his people from their sins, both from the condemning and from the commanding power of sin. It is plenteous redemption; there is an all-sufficient fulness in the Redeemer, enough for all, enough for each; therefore enough for me, says the believer. Redemption from sin includes redemption from all other evils, therefore it is a plenteous redemption, through the atoning blood of Jesus, who shall redeem his people from all their sins. All that wait on God for mercy and grace, are sure to have peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/130.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities - His people. He will completely deliver them from the power and the pollution of sin. This will ultimately be accomplished in reference to his whole church, and to every true member of that church. This was the highest object before the mind of the psalmist - that with which the psalm appropriately closes. And this is the highest object before the mind of every true child of God - that he may be completely and forever delivered from the power and the dominion of sin. This will be perfectly accomplished in heaven only; but there and then the bliss will be complete. The psalm begins with an earnest cry from the "depths;" it closes with the triumphant hope of complete and eternal deliverance. There is one world where there is no occasion to cry to God from the "depths" of sorrow and of sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/130.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8.

Out of these depths he cries to the God of salvation, and importunately prays Him who rules all things and can do all things to grant him a compliant hearing (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-13.htm">Genesis 26:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>, and other passages). God heard indeed even in Himself, as being the omniscient One, the softest and most secret as well as the loudest utterance; but, as Hilary observes, fides officium suum exsequitur, ut Dei auditionem roget, ut qui per naturam suam audit per orantis precem dignetur audire. In this sense the poet prays that His ears may be turned &#1511;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; (duller collateral form of &#1511;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;, to be in the condition of arrectae aures), with strained attention, to his loud and urgent petition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>). His life hangs upon the thread of the divine compassion. If God preserves iniquities, who can stand before Him?! He preserves them (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;) when He puts them down to one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>) and keeps them in remembrance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11</a>), or, as it is figuratively expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>, sealed up as it were in custody in order to punish them when the measure is full. The inevitable consequence of this is the destruction of the sinner, for nothing can stand against the punitive justice of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-15.htm">Ezra 9:15</a>). If God should show Himself as Ja&#772;h,<p>(Note: Eusebius on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a> (67):5 observes that the Logos is called &#x399;&#787;&#769;&#x3b1; as &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;. There is a similar passage in Vicentius Ciconia (1567), which we introduced into our larger Commentary on the Psalms (1859-60).)<p>no creature would be able to stand before Him, who is Adonaj, and can therefore carry out His judicial will or purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>). He does not, however, act thus. He does not proceed according to the legal stringency of recompensative justice. This thought, which fills up the pause after the question, but is not directly expressed, is confirmed by the following &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, which therefore, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm">Isaiah 28:28</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>), introduces the opposite. With the Lord is the willingness to forgive (&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492;), in order that He may be feared; i.e., He forgives, as it is expressed elsewhere (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-9.htm">Psalm 79:9</a>), for His Name's sake: He seeks therein the glorifying of His Name. He will, as the sole Author of our salvation, who, putting all vain-glorying to shame, causes mercy instead of justice to take its course with us (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>), be reverenced; and gives the sinner occasion, ground, and material for reverential thanksgiving and praise by bestowing "forgiveness" upon him in the plenitude of absolutely free grace. </body></html>
