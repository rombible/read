In the “watcher for the dawn” there may be an allusion to the Levite-sentinel whose duty it was to signal the first ray of dawn, and the moment for commencing the sacred rites of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm" title="Behold, bless you the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.">Psalm 134:1</a>), but the figure if general, as marking the impatience of a deeply agitated soul—a sufferer waiting for relief, a contrite sinner for forgiveness—is as striking as graceful. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-67.htm" title="In the morning you shall say, Would God it were even! and at even you shall say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of your heart with which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.">Deuteronomy 28:67</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/130.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-6.htm" title="My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.">Psalm 130:6</a>. </span><span class="ital">My soul waiteth for the Lord — </span>This verse in the original is remarkably concise, forcible, and elegant. It is literally, <span class="ital">My soul for the Lord, </span>(namely, waiteth,) <span class="ital">more than watchers for the morning, than watchers for the morning. </span>The psalmist is thought to intend those that kept the night-watches in the city, or the priests or Levites who watched in the temple; who, being wearied with hard service and want of rest, earnestly desired and eagerly expected the break of day, that they might be discharged from duty. Or, as Dr. Hammond and some others interpret the words, he means those priests, or their officers, “who were peculiarly appointed from a tower to expect the first appearance of the break of day.” The repetitions in this and the preceding verse beautifully and forcibly express that ardent desire with which true penitents expect and long for the salvation of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/130.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>130:5-8 It is for the Lord that my soul waits, for the gifts of his grace, and the working of his power. We must hope for that only which he has promised in his word. Like those who wish to see the dawn, being very desirous that light would come long before day; but still more earnestly does a good man long for the tokens of God's favour, and the visits of his grace. Let all that devote themselves to the Lord, cheerfully stay themselves on him. This redemption is redemption from all sin. Jesus Christ saves his people from their sins, both from the condemning and from the commanding power of sin. It is plenteous redemption; there is an all-sufficient fulness in the Redeemer, enough for all, enough for each; therefore enough for me, says the believer. Redemption from sin includes redemption from all other evils, therefore it is a plenteous redemption, through the atoning blood of Jesus, who shall redeem his people from all their sins. All that wait on God for mercy and grace, are sure to have peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/130.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning - More intently; more anxiously. The Septuagint and Latin Vulgate render this, "My soul hopeth in the Lord from the morning watch until night." The idea is that of watchers - night guards - who look anxiously for the break of day that they may be relieved. It is not that of persons who simply look for the return of day, but of those who are on guard - or it may be who watch beside the sick or the dying - and who look out on the east to mark the first indications of returning light. To them the night seems long; they are weary, and want repose; all around is cheerless, gloomy, and still; and they long for the first signs that light will again visit the world. Thus in affliction - the long, dark, dreary, gloomy night of sorrow - the sufferer looks for the first indication, the first faint ray of comfort to the soul. Thus under deep conviction for sin, and deep apprehension of the wrath of God - that night, dark, dreary, gloomy, often long - the soul looks for some ray of comfort, some intimation that God will be merciful, and will speak peace and pardon.<p>I say, more than they that watch for the morning - Margin, which watch unto the morning. The translation in the text best expresses the sense. There is something exceedingly beautiful and touching in this language of repetition, though it is much enfeebled by the words which our translators have inserted, "I say, more than." The Hebrew is, "more than they that watch for the morning - watch for the morning," as if the mind dwelt upon the words as better expressing its own anxious state than any other words could do. Everyone who has been afflicted will feel the force of this; every one who has been under conviction of sin, and who has felt himself in danger of suffering the wrath of God, will remember how anxiously he longed for mercy, for light, for peace, for some indication, even the most faint, like the first ray which breaks in the east, that his soul would find mercy and peace. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/130.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6. wait for the Lord&#8212;in expectation (Ps 27:14).<p>watch for, &c.&#8212;in earnestness and anxiety.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/130.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whether soldiers that keep the night watches in an army or city, or the priests or Levites who did so in the temple; who being wearied with hard service and want of convenient rest, diligently look for and fervently desire the morning, when they may be discharged.

This is repeated for the confirmation of it, and to show the vehement and constant disposition of his mind towards the Lord; as well as for the sake of what follows: <p>more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning; or, "more than the morning watchers, that watch for or until the morning" (h); than watchmen of cities, or the keepers of the wails, as Aben Ezra; those who are upon the last morning watch, and are looking out for the morning light; that they may go off from duty, and lie down and sleep: or than those that sit up with sick persons; who, being solitary and melancholy, as well as want sleep, long for the morning, that they may have some refreshment: or rather than the priests and Levites that watched in the temple, that waited for the morning, that they might be relieved by others; or else than those of that function, who were very diligent to observe the break of day, that they might enter upon their morning sacrifices; of which are many instances in the Misnah (i). So the Targum, <p>"more than they that observe the morning watches, which they observe to offer up the morning sacrifice:'' <p>and Kimchi's paraphrase is, <p>"who rise in the morning watches to pray.'' <p>The coming of Christ is said to be as the morning; and the light of God's countenance is comparable to the morning light; the discoveries of pardoning grace are through the bright shining of the sun of righteousness, and is the healing that is in his wings; and salvation and deliverance from any distress Is light that breaks forth as the morning: all and each of these are more desirable, and more to be waited for, than the natural light of the morning; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>. <p>(h) So Junius &amp; Tremellius, Musculus, Cocceius.

The repetition of <span class="ital">watchmen for the morning</span> gives a touch of pathetic earnestness. Most commentators suppose that military sentinels are meant by <span class="ital">watchmen</span>; but the Targum renders, “My soul waits for Jehovah, more than the keepers of the morning-watch which they keep in order to offer the morning sacrifice,” understanding the allusion to be to the custom that one of the Levites who kept the night watch in the Temple was appointed to watch for the moment of the dawn, at which the daily sacrifice was to be offered. This explanation adds point to the comparison, for the Levites were watching with eager expectation for a dawn which would bring not merely release from toil but positive blessing, in the renewed assurance of God’s covenant mercy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The P.B.V. <span class="ital">before the morning watch, I say, before the morning watch</span>, is derived from Münster’s <span class="ital">ante custodes matutinos, ante custodes, inquam, matutinos</span>.

But side by side with the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the lxx we also find the reading exanthee'sai; and in this sense Jerome renders (statim ut) viruerit, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (to shoot into a stalk), Aquila &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, the Sexta &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (to attain to full solidity). The Targum paraphrases &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1507; in both senses: to shoot up and to pluck off. The former signification, after which Venema interprets: antequam se evaginet vel evaginetur, i.e., antequam e vaginulis suis se evolvat et succrescat, is also advocated by Parchon, Kimchi, and Aben-Ezra. In the same sense von Ortenberg conjectures &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1500;&#1507;. Since the grass of the house-tops or roofs, if one wishes to pull it up, can be pulled up just as well when it is withered as when it is green, and since it is the most natural thing to take &#1495;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; as the subject to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1507;, we decide in favour of the intransitive signification, "to put itself forth, to develope, shoot forth into ear." The roof-grass withers before it has put forth ears of blossoms, just because it has no deep root, and therefore cannot stand against the heat of the sun.<p>(Note: So, too, Geiger in the Deutsche Morgenlndische Zeitschrift, xiv. 278f., according to whom Arab. slf (s&#780;lf) occurs in Saadia and Abu-Said in the signification "to be in the first maturity, to blossom," - a sense &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1507; may also have here; cf. the Talmudic &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1508;&#1508;&#1497; used of unripe dates that are still in blossom.)<p>The poet pursues the figure of the grass of the house-tops still further. The encompassing lap or bosom (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) is called elsewhere &#1495;&#1510;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-13.htm">Nehemiah 5:13</a>); here it is &#1495;&#1510;&#1503;, like the Arabic h&#803;id&#803;n (diminutive h&#803;od&#803;ein), of the same root with &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1494;, a creek, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-30.htm">Psalm 107:30</a>. The enemies of Israel are as grass upon the house-tops, which is not garnered in; their life closes with sure destruction, the germ of which they (without any need for any rooting out) carry within themselves. The observation of Knapp, that any Western poet would have left off with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>, is based upon the error that <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/129-7.htm">Psalm 129:7-8</a> are an idle embellishment. The greeting addressed to the reapers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-8.htm">Psalm 129:8</a> is taken from life; it is not denied even to heathen reapers. Similarly Boaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-4.htm">Ruth 2:4</a>) greets them with "Jahve be with you," and receivers the counter-salutation, "Jahve bless thee." Here it is the passers-by who call out to those who are harvesting: The blessing (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;) of Jahve happen to you (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;,<p>(Note: Here and there &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; is found as an error of the copyist. The Hebrew Psalter, Basel 1547, 12mo, notes it as a various reading.)<p>as in the Aaronitish blessing), and (since "we bless you in the name of Jahve" would be a purposeless excess of politeness in the mouth of the same speakers) receive in their turn the counter-salutation: We bless you in the name of Jahve. As a contrast it follows that there is before the righteous a garnering in of that which they have sown amidst the exchange of joyful benedictory greetings. </body></html>
