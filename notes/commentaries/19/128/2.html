This picture of a successful and peaceful husbandry, which itself throws a whole flood of light on the condition of Palestine and of the people, now not nomadic but agricultural, is rendered still more emphatic by references to the numerous passages where it is foretold that enemies would devour the harvests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/28-30.htm" title="You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build an house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not gather the grapes thereof.">Deuteronomy 28:30-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm" title="I also will do this to you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.">Leviticus 26:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Happy.</span>—The same word translated <span class= "ital">blessed </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-1.htm" title="Blessed is every one that fears the LORD; that walks in his ways.">Psalm 128:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/128.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-2.htm" title="For you shall eat the labor of your hands: happy shall you be, and it shall be well with you.">Psalm 128:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt eat the labour, </span>&c. — Thy labour shall not be vain and fruitless, and the fruit of thy labour shall not be taken from thee and possessed by others, as was threatened to the disobedient Deuteronomy 28., but enjoyed by thyself with comfort and satisfaction. <span class="ital">Happy shalt thou be — </span>Whether thou be high or low, rich or poor, in the world, if thou fear God, and walk in his ways, thou mayest take the comfort of the promise to thyself, and expect the benefit of it, as if it were directed to thee by name. <span class="ital">And it shall be well with thee — </span>Both in this world and (as even the Chaldee paraphrast interprets the words) in the world to come.

In vain do we pretend to be of those that fear God, if we do not make conscience of keeping stedfastly to his ways. Blessed is every one that fears the Lord; whether he be high or low, rich or poor in the world. If thou fear him and walk in his ways, all shall be well with thee while thou livest, better when thou diest, best of all in eternity. By the blessing of God, the godly shall get an honest livelihood. Here is a double promise; they shall have something to do, for an idle life is a miserable, uncomfortable life, and shall have health and strength, and power of mind to do it. They shall not be forced to live upon the labours of other people. It is as much a mercy as a duty, with quietness to work and eat our own bread. They and theirs shall enjoy what they get. Such as fear the Lord and walk in his ways, are the only happy persons, whatever their station in life may be. They shall have abundant comfort in their family relations. And they shall have all the good things God has promised, and which they pray for. A good man can have little comfort in seeing his children's children, unless he sees peace upon Israel. Every true believer rejoices in the prosperity of the church. Hereafter we shall see greater things, with the everlasting peace and rest that remain for the Israel of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/128.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands - Thou shalt enjoy the avails of thy labor; thou shalt be secure in thy rights. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>. This is a general promise respecting the prosperity which religion affords. If all people were truly religious, this would be universal, so far as man is concerned. Property would be secure; and, except so far as abundant harvests might be prevented by the direct providence of God - by blight, and mildew, and storms, and drought - all people would enjoy undisturbed the avails of their labor. Slavery, whereby one man is compelled to labor for another, would come to an end; every one who is now a slave would "eat the labor of his own hands;" and property would no more be swept away by war, or become the prey of robbers and freebooters. Religion, if it prevailed universally, would produce universal security in our rights.<p>Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee - literally, "Happy thou, and well with thee." That is, happiness and security would be the consequence of true religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/128.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

That is, thou that fearest the Lord, and walkest in his ways. It is an apostrophe, or address to such, even to everyone of them; instancing in one part of the blessedness that belongs to them, enjoyment of what their hands have laboured for; which may be understood both in a literal and spiritual sense: man must labour and get his bread with the sweat of his brow; he that will not work should not eat, he that does should; and a good man may have a comfortable enjoyment of the good of his labour; than which, as to temporal blessings, there is nothing better under the sun, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; and, in a spiritual sense, good men labour in prayers at the throne of grace, there lifting up holy hands to God, wrestling with him for a blessing, which they enjoy; they labour in attendance on the word and ordinances, for the meat which endures to everlasting life; and they find the word and eat it, and Christ in it, whose flesh is meat indeed; and feed by faith on it, to the joy and comfort of their souls; <p>happy shall thou be, and it shall be well with thee; or, to thy soul, as the Syriac version; happy as to temporal things, and well as to spiritual ones: such having an apparent special interest in the love, grace, mercy, and delight of God; in his providence, protection, and care; in the supplies of his grace, and in his provisions for his people, in time and eternity. It is well with such that felt God, in life and at death, at judgment and for ever: and the Targum is, <p>"thou art blessed in this world, and it shall be well with thee in the world to come;'' <p>and so Arama. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/128.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thou shalt eat the labour of thine <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> hands: happy <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i>, and <i>it shall be</i> well with thee.</span><p>(b) The world esteems them happy who live in wealth and idleness but the Holy Spirit approves them best who live of the mean profit of their labours.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/128.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.

The rearing of the house which affords us protection, and the stability of the city in which we securely and peaceably dwell, the acquisition of possessions that maintain and adorn life, the begetting and rearing of sons that may contribute substantial support to the father as he grows old - all these are things which depend upon the blessing of God without natural preliminary conditions being able to guarantee them, well-devised arrangements to ensure them, unwearied labours to obtain them by force, or impatient care and murmuring to get them by defiance. Many a man builds himself a house, but he is not able to carry out the building of it, or he dies before he is able to take possession of it, or the building fails through unforeseen misfortunes, or, if it succeeds, becomes a prey to violent destruction: if God Himself do not build it, they labour thereon (&#1506;&#1502;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-10.htm">Jonah 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:21</a>) in vain who build it. Many a city is well-ordered, and seems to be secured by wise precautions against every misfortune, against fire and sudden attack; but if God Himself do not guard it, it is in vain that those to whom its protection is entrusted give themselves no sleep and perform (&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;, a word that has only come into frequent use since the literature of the Salomonic age) the duties of their office with the utmost devotion. The perfect in the apodosis affirms what has been done on the part of man to be ineffectual if the former is not done on God's part; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>. Many rise up early in order to get to their work, and delay the sitting down as along as possible; i.e., not: the lying down (Hupfeld), for that is &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;, not &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;; but to take a seat in order to rest a little, and, as what follows shows, to eat (Hitzig). &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; stand opposed to one another: the latter cannot therefore mean to remain sitting at one's work, in favour of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a> (where &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; form an antithesis) cannot be properly compared. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-24.htm">1 Samuel 20:24</a> shows that prior to the incursion of the Grecian custom they did not take their meals lying or reclining (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;- or &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), but sitting. It is vain for you - the poet exclaims to them - it will not after all bring hat you think to be able to acquire; in so doing you eat only the bread of sorrow, i.e., bread that is procured with toil and trouble (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;): &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, in like manner, i.e., the same as you are able to procure only by toilsome and anxious efforts, God gives to His beloved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>)   &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488; ( equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;), in sleep (an adverbial accusative like &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;), i.e., without restless self-activity, in a state of self-forgetful renunciation, and modest, calm surrender to Him: "God bestows His gifts during the night," says a German proverb, and a Greek proverb even says: &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;. Bttcher takes &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; in the sense of "so  equals  without anything further;" and &#1499;&#1503; certainly has this meaning sometimes (vid., introduction to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1-7</a>), but not in this passage, where, as referring back, it stands at the head of the clause, and where what this mimic &#1499;&#1503; would import lies in the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;. </body></html>
