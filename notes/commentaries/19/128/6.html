In vain do we pretend to be of those that fear God, if we do not make conscience of keeping stedfastly to his ways. Blessed is every one that fears the Lord; whether he be high or low, rich or poor in the world. If thou fear him and walk in his ways, all shall be well with thee while thou livest, better when thou diest, best of all in eternity. By the blessing of God, the godly shall get an honest livelihood. Here is a double promise; they shall have something to do, for an idle life is a miserable, uncomfortable life, and shall have health and strength, and power of mind to do it. They shall not be forced to live upon the labours of other people. It is as much a mercy as a duty, with quietness to work and eat our own bread. They and theirs shall enjoy what they get. Such as fear the Lord and walk in his ways, are the only happy persons, whatever their station in life may be. They shall have abundant comfort in their family relations. And they shall have all the good things God has promised, and which they pray for. A good man can have little comfort in seeing his children's children, unless he sees peace upon Israel. Every true believer rejoices in the prosperity of the church. Hereafter we shall see greater things, with the everlasting peace and rest that remain for the Israel of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/128.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children - This is a continuation of the idea of blessedness as connected with a numerous posterity - an object of so much interest to the Hebrews (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>), and having its foundation in our nature.<p>And peace upon Israel - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-5.htm">Psalm 125:5</a>.

It is with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (recalling <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-18.htm">Genesis 30:18</a>) just as with &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514;. Just as the latter in this passage denotes an inheritance not according to hereditary right, but in accordance with the free-will of the giver, so the former denotes not a reward that is paid out as in duty bound, but a recompense that is bestowed according to one's free judgment, and in fact looked for in accordance with a promise given, but cannot by any means be demanded. Sons are a blessed gift from above. They are - especially when they are the offspring of a youthful marriage (opp. &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-20.htm">Genesis 44:20</a>), and accordingly themselves strong and hearty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>), and at the time that the father is growing old are in the bloom of their years - like arrows in the hand of a warrior. This is a comparison which the circumstances of his time made natural to the poet, in which the sword was carried side by side with the trowel, and the work of national restoration had to be defended step by step against open enemies, envious neighbours, and false brethren. It was not sufficient then to have arrows in the quiver; one was obligated to have them not merely at hand, but in the hand (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;), in order to be able to discharge them and defend one's self. What a treasure, in such a time when it was needful to be constantly ready for fighting, defensive or offensive, was that which youthful sons afforded to the elderly father and weaker members of the family! Happy is the man - the poet exclaims - who has his quiver, i.e., his house, full of such arrows, in order to be able to deal out to the enemies as many arrows as may be needed. The father and such a host of sons surrounding him (this is the complex notion of the subject) form a phalanx not to be broken through. If they have to speak with enemies in the gate - i.e., candidly to upbraid them with their wrong, or to ward off their unjust accusation - they shall not be ashamed, i.e., not be overawed, disheartened, or disarmed. Gesenius in his Thesaurus, as Ibn-Jachja has already done, takes &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; here in the signification "to destroy;" but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-13.htm">Genesis 34:13</a> this Piel signifies to deal behind one's back (deceitfully), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-10.htm">2 Chronicles 22:10</a> to get rid of by assassination. This shade of the notion, which proceeds from Arab. dbr, pone esse (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>), does not suit the passage before us, and the expression &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; is favourable to the idea of the gate as being the forum, which arises from taking &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; in its ordinary signification. Unjust judges, malicious accusers, and false witnesses retire shy and faint-hearted before a family so capable of defending itself. We read the opposite of this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-4.htm">Job 5:4</a> of sons upon whom the curse of their fathers rests. </body></html>
