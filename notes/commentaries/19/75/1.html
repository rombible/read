Man's sin threatened to destroy the whole creation; but Christ saved the world from utter ruin. He who is made of God to us wisdom, bids us be wise.

The reasons for this public thanksgiving are stated in the subsequent part of the psalm.<p>Do we give thanks - The repetition is emphatic. The idea is, that the occasion was one for special thanksgiving.<p>For that thy name is near - literally, "and near is thy name." The word name is often used to designate the person himself; and the idea here is, that God was near; that he had manifested himself to them in some special manner, and that for this there was occasion of praise. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23</a>.<p>Thy wondrous works declare - Or, "They declare thy wondrous works." The Septuagint renders it, "I will declare all thy wondrous works." The Latin Vulgate, "We will declare thy wonders." Luther, "We will declare thy wonders, that thy name is so near." Prof. Alexander, "They recount thy wonders." The meaning seems to be, "They," that is, the people, "declare thy wondrous works." Thy marvelous doings constitute the foundation for praise - for the praise now offered. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/75.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 75<p>Ps 75:1-10.

Not to ourselves for we were helpless, but to Elohim who heard our cry, and replied to the taunt of our foes. Never let us neglect thanksgiving, or we may fear that another time our prayers will remain unanswered. As the smiling flowers gratefully reflect in their lovely colours the various constituents of the solar ray, so should gratitude spring up in our hearts after the smiles of God's providence. "Unto thee do we give thanks." We should praise God again and again. Stinted gratitude is ingratitude. For infinite goodness there should be measureless thanks. Faith promises redoubled praise for greatly needed and signal deliverances. "For that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare." God is at hand to answer and do wonders - adore we then the present Deity. We sing not of a hidden God, who sleeps and leaves the church to her fate, but of one who ever in our darkest days is most near, a very present help in trouble, "Near is his name." Baal is on a journey, but Jehovah dwells in his church. Glory be unto the Lord, whose perpetual deeds of grace and majesty are the sure tokens of his being with us always, even unto the end of the world. <span class="bld">Of Asaph; </span> as the author.

Either David and his men, when he was delivered from Saul, and raised to the kingdom, or the Jews upon their return from the Babylonish captivity; or rather the churches of Christ under the Gospel dispensation, for the coming of Christ and the blessings of grace through him, and in the view of the sure and certain destruction of antichrist and all the wicked of the earth; yea, Christ himself may be considered as at the head of his people, joining with them in thanksgiving, to whom this action is sometimes ascribed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a> and the rather since he is continued all along speaking to the end of the psalm: <p>unto thee do we give thanks; which is repeated to show the constancy, fervency, and sincerity with which this was performed: it may be rendered, "unto thee do we confess" (l); sins committed against God, unworthiness to receive favours from him, and his grace and goodness in bestowing them: <p>for that thy name is near; or rather, "for thy name is near" (m); and so the words are a reason of the above thanksgiving; for they belong not so much to what follows after as to what goes before, since the accent "athnach" is upon  "thy name"; and are to be understood of God himself, for his name is himself; who is near to his people, both in relation, being their Father, and as to presence, communion, and fellowship, which are matter of praise and thanksgiving; or his works and word, by which he is known and made manifest; his works which are throughout the earth, and so near at hand, and his word which is nigh, being in the mouths and in the hearts of his people; or rather his Son, in whom his name is, his nature and divine perfections: he was at a distance in promise and prophecy, and only seen afar off; after the Babylonish captivity, at which time some think this psalm was written, he was near; the prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, speak of him as just coming; and when he was made flesh, and dwelt among men, he was near indeed, so as to be found of them, seen, heard, and handled by them; on which account there was and is reason to give thanks to God: <p>thy wondrous works declare; meaning either the miracles of Christ, which were proofs and evidences of his being come, and of his being the true Messiah; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a> or the wonderful works done by him, which to do were the principal end of his coming; as the work of righteousness, the business of reconciliation, and in general the affair of redemption and salvation; all which were amazing instances of his power, grace, and goodness, and which are declared in the everlasting Gospel by the ministers of it; for the words, I think, may be better rendered, "they declare thy wondrous works" (n), or impersonally, "thy wondrous works are declared". <p>(k) "ipsi Asaph", Pagninus, Montanus; "Asapho", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

Since ever present facts of creation have been referred to just now, and the historical mighty deeds of God only further back, &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; refers rather forwards to the blaspheming of the enemies which He suffers now to go on unpunished, as though He took no cognizance of it. &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; has Pasek after it in order to separate the word, which signifies reviling, from the most holy Name. The epithet &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; reminds one of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a> according to the accents &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; is the absolute state (the primary form of &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>): give not over, abandon not to the wild beast (beasts), the soul of Thy turtle-dove. This is probably correct, since &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, "to the eager wild beast," this inversion of the well-known expression &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which on the contrary yields the sense of vita animae, is an improbable and exampleless expression. If &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; were intended to be thus understood, the poet might have written &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;, "give not Thy turtle-dove over to the desire of the wild beast." Hupfeld thinks that the "old, stupid reading" may be set right at one stroke, inasmuch as he reads &#1488;&#1500; &#1514;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513; &#1495;&#1497;&#1514; &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;, and renders it "give not to rage the life Thy turtle-dove;" but where is any support to be found for this &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, "to rage," or rather (Psychology, S. 202; tr. p. 239) "to eager desire?" The word cannot signify this in such an isolated position. Israel, which is also compared to a dove in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>, is called a turtle-dove (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a> &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; has the same signification as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a>, and the same sense as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-11.htm">Psalm 68:11</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-37.htm">Psalm 69:37</a>): the creatures of Thy miserable ones, i.e., Thy poor, miserable creatures - a figurative designation of the ecclesia pressa. The church, which it is the custom of the Asaphic Psalms to designate with emblematical names taken from the animal world, finds itself now like sheep among wolves, and seems to itself as if it were forgotten by God. The cry of prayer &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; comes forth out of circumstances such as were those of the Maccabaean age. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is the covenant of circumcision (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>); the persecution of the age of the Seleucidae put faith to the severe test, that circumcision, this sign which was the pledge to Israel of God's gracious protection, became just the sign by which the Syrians knew their victims. In the Book of Daniel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>, &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is used directly of the religion of Israel and its band of confessors. The confirmatory clause <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-20.htm">Psalm 74:20</a> also corresponds to the Maccabaean age, when the persecuted confessors hid themselves far away in the mountains (1 Macc. 2:26ff., 2 Macc. 6:11), but were tracked by the enemy and slain, - at that time the hiding-places (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, 1 Macc. 1:53) of the land were in reality full of the habitations of violence. The combination &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; is like &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-37.htm">Jeremiah 25:37</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>. From this point the Psalm draws to a close in more familiar Psalm - strains. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-21.htm">Psalm 74:21</a>, viz., from drawing near to Thee with their supplications. "The reproach of the foolish all the day" is that which incessantly goes forth from them. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, "going up (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-12.htm">1 Samuel 5:12</a>, not: increasing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-35.htm">1 Kings 22:35</a>) perpetually," although without the article, is not a predicate, but attributive (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>). The tone of the prayer is throughout temperate; this the ground upon which it bases itself is therefore all the more forcible. </body></html>
