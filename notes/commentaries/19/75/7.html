No second causes will raise men to preferment without the First Cause. It comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. He mentions not the north; the same word that signifies the north, signifies the secret place; and from the secret of God's counsel it does come. From God alone all must receive their doom. There are mixtures of mercy and grace in the cup of affliction, when it is put into the hands of God's people; mixtures of the curse, when it is put into the hands of the wicked. God's people have their share in common calamities, but the dregs of the cup are for the wicked. The exaltation of the Son of David will be the subject of the saints' everlasting praises. Then let sinners submit to the King of righteousness, and let believers rejoice in and obey him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/75.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But God is the judge - All depends on him, not on the natural advantages of a country; not on human strength, human skill, or human prowess.

He presides over all; he can give success when it is least expected; and he also can humble people when they have made the most ample preparations for success, and anticipate it in the most confident manner.<p>He putteth down one, and setteth up another - Literal y, "This one he humbles, and this he exalts."

Or "because God is the Judge" (u); and so this is another reason why fools should not deal foolishly, nor wicked men lift up the horn, and speak with a stiff neck, because there is a Judge to whom they are accountable for their words and actions; and this Judge is God omniscient, knows all persons and things, searches the heart and tries the reins, will bring every secret thing into judgment, bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the heart; omnipotent, able to do all things, raise the dead, call to judgment, bring all before him, pass the sentences, and execute them; omnipresent, there is no fleeing from him, nor escaping his righteous judgment; holy, just, and true, who will render to every man according to his works: <p>he putteth down one, and setteth up another; he humbles or brings one low, such as are proud, haughty, and arrogant; and he exalts another, such as are lowly and humble: this he does in providence, he removes kings, and sets up kings; puts down the mighty from their seats, and exalts them of low degree, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, he has many ways to mortify the proud, by inflicting diseases on their bodies, by stripping them of their honour and wealth, and by bringing them into disgrace among men: and this he does in grace; such as are stout hearted and far from righteousness, and will not submit to the righteousness of Christ, he brings them to it; and those whom he makes humble by his grace, he raises to a high estate, to be kings and priests, and to sit among princes, and to inherit a throne of glory. This might be exemplified in Jews and Gentiles; he has stripped the one of their privileges, and put them down from their civil and church state, and raised up the other to be his church and people; and also in antichrist and the true church of Christ; he will ere long put down the one, that sits as a queen, and exalt the other, when she shall be as a bride adorned for her husband, having the glory of God upon her. <p>(u) "quoniam", V.

The connection with &#1493; in &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; presents a difficulty. Neither here nor anywhere else is it to be supposed that &#1493; is synonymous with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; but at any rate even &#1499;&#1497; might stand instead of it. For Hupfeld's attempt to explain it: and "near is Thy name" Thy wonders have declared; and Hitzig's: and Thou whose Name is near, they declare Thy wondrous works - are past remedy. Such a personification of wonders does not belong to the spirit of Hebrew poetry, and such a relative clause lies altogether beyond the bounds of syntax. If we would, however, take &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>, as a result of the thanksgiving (Campensis), then that for which thanks are rendered would remain undefined; neither will it do to take &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; as referring to the being inwardly present (Hengstenberg), since this, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-14.htm">Deuteronomy 30:14</a>), would require some addition, which should give to the nearness this reference to the mouth or to the heart. Thus, therefore, nothing remains for us but to connect the nearness of the Name of God as an outward fact with the earnest giving of thanks. The church has received the promise of an approaching judicial, redemptive revelation of God, and now says, "We give Thee thanks, we give thanks and near is Thy Name;" it welcomes the future act of God with heartfelt thanksgiving, all those who belong to it declare beforehand the wonders of God. Such was really the position of matters when in Hezekiah's time the oppression of the Assyrians had reached its highest point - Isaiah's promises of a miraculous divine deliverance were at that time before them, and the believing ones saluted beforehand, with thanksgiving, the "coming Name of Jahve" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>). The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which was to be expected after &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>.) does not follow until <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>. God Himself undertakes the confirmation of the forthcoming thanksgiving and praise by a direct announcement of the help that is hailed and near at hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>). It is not to be rendered, "when I shall seize," etc., for <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a> has not the structure of an apodosis. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is confirmatory, and whatever interpretation we may give to it, the words of the church suddenly change into the words of God. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; in the language of prophecy, more especially of the apocalyptic character, is a standing expression fore the appointed time of the final judgment (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>). When this moment or juncture in the lapse of time shall have arrived, then God will seize or take possession of it (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495; in the unweakened original sense of taking hold of with energy, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>): He Himself will then interpose and hold judgment according to the strictly observed rule of right (&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, adverbial accusative, cf. &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>, and frequently). If it even should come to pass that the earth and all its inhabitants are melting away (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a>), i.e., under the pressure of injustice (as is to be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>), are disheartened, scattered asunder, and are as it were in the act of dissolution, then He (the absolute I, &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497;) will restrain this melting away: He setteth in their places the pillars, i.e., the internal shafts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-6.htm">Job 9:6</a>), of the earth, or without any figure: He again asserts the laws which lie at the foundation of its stability. &#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is a mood of certainty, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a> is a circumstantial clause placed first, after the manner of the Latin ablative absolute. Hitzig appropriately compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-9.htm">Proverbs 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-15.htm">Isaiah 23:15</a> may also be understood according to this bearing of the case.<p>The utterance of God is also continued after the Sela. It is not the people of God who turn to the enemies with the language of warning on the ground of the divine promise (Hengstenberg); the poet would then have said &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, or must at least have said &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. God Himself speaks, and His words are not yet peremptorily condemning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-16.htm">Psalm 50:16</a>., cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-11.htm">Psalm 46:11</a>, but admonitory and threatening, because it is not He who has already appeared for the final judgment who speaks, but He who announces His appearing. With &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; He tells the braggarts who are captivated with the madness of supposed greatness, and the evil-doers who lift up the horn or the head, <p>(Note: The head is called in Sanscrit iras, in Zend aranh,  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;; the horn in Sanscrit, ringa, i.e., (according to Burnlouf, Etudes, p. 19) that which proceeds from and projects out of the head (iras), Zend rva  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; (k&#803;arn).)<p>hat He will have once for all said to them, and what they are to suffer to be said to them for the short space of time till the judgment. The poet, if we have assigned the right date to the Psalm, has Rabshakeh and his colleagues before his mind, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>. The &#1500;, as in that passage, and like &#1488;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a> (vid., Khler), has the idea of a hostile tendency. &#1488;&#1500; rules also over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>: "speak not insolence with a raised neck." It is not to be construed &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, with a stiff neck. Parallel passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, and more especially the primary passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>, show that &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; is an object-notion, and that &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; by itself (with which, too, the accentuation harmonizes, since Munach here is the vicarius of a distinctive), according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-26.htm">Job 15:26</a>, has the sense of &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; or &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;. </body></html>
