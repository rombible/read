The sun is no mere mechanical timepiece to the Israelite poet, but a conscious servant of God. How beautifully this mention of sunset prepares the way for the exquisite picture of the nocturnal landscape, as the sunrise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-22.htm" title="The sun rises, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.">Psalm 104:22</a> does for the landscape of the day.<p>In Genesis the creation of the “heavenly bodies”—the fourth day’s work—is related in, so to speak, a scientific manner. But the poet, as in the former part of his treatment of the subject, at once goes to the influence of these phenomena on animated being. In Genesis the lamps of heaven are, as it were, hung out at God’s command; in the poem they seem to move to their office of guiding the seasons and illuminating the earth like living things who are conscious of the glorious function they have to perform.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/104.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-19.htm" title="He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down.">Psalm 104:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">He appointeth the moon, </span>&c. — “From a survey of the works of God upon the earth, the psalmist proceeds to extol that divine wisdom which is manifested in the motions and revolutions of the heavenly bodies, and in the grateful vicissitude of day and night occasioned thereby.” <span class="ital">For seasons — </span>For measuring the weeks and months, and, among many nations, years also, distinguishing the seasons of the year, and directing the business of the husbandman; for governing the tides, the state of the weather, and divers other natural events; as also the times for sacred and civil affairs, which were commonly regulated by the moon, not only among the Jews, but among heathen also: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm" title="And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:">Genesis 1:14</a>.

Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenous creatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language of grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings which cannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be done in its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he must continue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night comes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works of God. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the more rough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. They are all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designed to serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a new world rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alone lives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soul enters on another state, and his body will be raised, either to glory or to misery. May the Lord send forth his Spirit, and new-create our souls to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/104.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He appointed the moon for seasons - <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-18</a>. That is, The moon, as well as the sun, is appointed to divide time; to determine its progress; to indicate the return of festival occasions, or appointed times to be observed in any manner. It is, in fact, the foundation of the division of the year into "months," and consequently the indication of all that is to be observed in the "months" of the year. But for this, there would be no natural divisions of time except those of day and night, and of the year. How great an advantage it is for the purpose of life, to have time broken up into brief intervals or periods which can be marked and remembered, both in our private life and in history, it is not necessary to say. God has been pleased to add to the natural divisions of time into days, and years, and months, an "artificial" division - the "fourth" part of the moon's course - "a week," indicated by the Sabbath, thus greatly facilitating the plans of life in regard to stated times or "seasons," and especially in regard to religious observances. The idea in the passage before us is, that the whole arrangement is one of benevolence, promoting the comfort of man, and bringing the ideas of succession, variety, and beauty into the system.<p>The sun knoweth his going down - As if conscious of what he is doing, he knows the exact time of setting, and never varies, but always obeys the divine command; never sets "before" his time - unexpectedly shortening the day, and leaving man in sudden darkness in the midst of his toil; and never lingers above the horizon "after" the moment has come for his setting, but withdraws at the exact time, enabling man to close his toil, and seek repose, and giving an opportunity for another class of creatures to come forth on the animated scene. Their good is regarded as well as that of man; and the operations of nature are so arranged as to promote the welfare of all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-19.

The moon is mentioned first, because in the Jewish day the night leads the way. "He appointed the moon for seasons." By the waxing and waning of the moon the year is divided into months, and weeks, and by this means the exact dates of the holy days are arranged. Thus the lamp of night is made to be of service to man, and in fixing the period of religious assemblies (as it did among the Jews) it enters into connection with his noblest being. Never let us regard the moon's motions as the inevitable result of inanimate impersonal law, but as the appointment of our God. "The sun knoweth his going down." In finely poetic imagery the sun is represented as knowing when to retire from sight, and sink below the horizon. He never loiters on his way, or pauses as if undecided when to descend; his appointed hour for going down, although it is constantly varying, he always keeps to a second. We need to be aroused in the morning, but he arises punctually, and though some require to watch the clock to know the hour of rest, he, without a timepiece to consult, hides himself in the western sky the instant the set time has come. For all this man should praise the Lord of the sun and moon, who has made these great lights to be our chronometers, and thus keeps our world in order, and suffers no confusion to distract us.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-20.htm">Psalm 104:20</a><p>"Thou makest darkness, and it is night." Drawing down the blinds for us, he prepares our bedchamber that we may sleep. Were there no darkness we should sigh for it, since we should find repose so much more difficult if the weary day were never calmed into night. Let us see God's hand in the veiling of the sun, and never fear either natural or providential darkness, since both are of the Lord's own making. "Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth." Then is the lion's day, his time to hunt his food. Why should not the wild beast have his hour as well as man? He has a service to perform, should he not also have his food? Darkness is fitter for beasts than man; and those men are most brutish who love darkness rather than light. When the darkness of ignorance broods over a nation, then all sorts of superstitions, cruelties, and vices abound; the gospel, like the sunrising, soon clears the world of the open ravages of these monsters, and they seek more congenial abodes. We see here the value of true light, for we may depend upon it where there is night there will also be wild beasts to kill and to devour.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a><p>"The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God." This is the poetic interpretation of a roar. To whom do the lions roar? Certainly not to their prey, for the terrible sound tends to alarm their victims, and drive them away. They after their own fashion express their desires for food, and the expression of desire is a kind of prayer. Out of this fact comes the devout thought of the wild beast's appealing to its Maker for food. But neither with lions nor men will the seeking 6f prayer suffice, there must be practical seeking too, and the lions are well aware of it. What they have in their own language asked for they go forth to seek; being in this thing far wiser than many men who offer formal prayers not half so earnest as those of the young lions, and then neglect the means in the use of which the object of their petitions might be gained. The lions roar and seek; too many are liars before God, and roar but never seek.<p>How comforting is the thought that the Spirit translates the voice of a lion, and finds it to be a seeking of meat from God! May we not hope that our poor broken cries and groans, which in our sorrow we have called "the voice of our roaring" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10</a>), will be understood by him, and interpreted in our favour. Evidently he considers the meaning rather than the music of the utterance, and puts the best construction upon it.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-22.htm">Psalm 104:22</a><p>"The sun ariseth." Every evening has its morning to make the day. Were it not that we have seen the sun rise so often we should think it the greatest of miracles, and the most amazing of blessings. "They gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens." Thus they are out of man's way, and he seldom encounters them unless he desires to do so. The forest's warriors retire to their quarters when the morning's drum is heard, finding in the recesses of their dens a darkness suitable for their slumbers; there they lay them down and digest their food, for God has allotted even to them their portion of rest and enjoyment. There was one who in this respect was poorer than lions and foxes, for he had not where to lay his head: all were provided for except their incarnate Provider.

What is here expressed concerning his setting is necessarily supposed concerning his rising also; but he mentions only his setting, as most agreeable to the context, because that did usher in the rising of the moon, of which he now spake, and the entrance of the night, of which he speaks in the next words. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/104.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He appointeth the moon for seasons,.... Or, "he made" (e); for the moon is the work of his hands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a> as is likewise the sun. From the rain the psalmist passes to the luminaries; for this reason, as Aben Ezra thinks, because they are the cause of rain: the moon is taken notice of in the first place, because, as Kimchi observes, the night was before the day; and in the night of the fourth day were the sun, moon, and stars; but the sun rose in the morning. The moon was made for seasons as well as the sun, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a> or that times might be numbered by it, as the Targum, both months and years; one of its courses and revolutions making a month, and twelve of these a year; which lunar years were in use among some nations: as also it is supposed to have an influence on the ebbing and flowing of the tides; and served to regulate the festivals of the Jews, their set appointed times, as the word signifies, and is used of them, and which were governed by it. And this Jarchi takes to be the sense of the passage; though Aben Ezra more truly remarks, that it purely belongs to the work of creation, and the original design and use of this luminary. It was an emblem of the ceremonial law; which consisted, among other things, in the observation of new moons; which gave some light in the time of Jewish darkness, though but a dim one, in comparison of the Gospel; had its imperfections, was changeable, waxed old, and vanished away; and which the church is said to have under her feet, being abolished, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>. Though some think the world is meant, which is changeable and fading. It was also an emblem of the church, Sol 6:10 which receives her light from Christ, the sun of righteousness; has its different phases and appearances; sometimes being in prosperity, and sometimes in adversity; has its spots and imperfections, and yet beautiful, through the grace of God and righteousness of Christ. <p>The sun knoweth his going down; not the going down of the moon, which is the sense of some, according to Kimchi; but his own going down; and so he knows his rising, to which this is opposed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a> and every revolution, diurnal or annual, he makes; and which he constantly and punctually observes, as if he was a creature endued with reason and understanding; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>. He knows the time of his setting, as the Targum, Syriac, and Arabic versions; and also the place where he is to set, at the different seasons of the year, and indeed every day. This luminary is an emblem of Christ, the sun of righteousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a> the fountain of all light; the light of nature, grace, and glory; and of all spiritual life and heat, as well as fruitfulness. He arose at his incarnation, and set at his death, the time of both which he full well knew; and he has his risings and settings, with respect to the manifestation of himself to his people, or hiding himself from them, which depend on his pleasure. <p>(e) "fecit", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He appointed <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> the moon for seasons: <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> the sun knoweth his going down.</span><p>(i) As to separate the night from the day, and to note days, months and years.<p>(k) That is, by his course, either far or near, it notes summer, winter and other seasons.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>.

God, the blessed One, being the principal subject of the Psalm, the poet (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-10.htm">Psalm 104:10</a> and further on) is able to go on in attributive and predicative participles: Who sendeth springs &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, into the wads (not: &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, as brooks). &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-10.htm">Psalm 104:10</a> shows, is here a synonym of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1492;, and there is no need for saying that, flowing on in the plains, they grow into rivers. The lxx has &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; is doubly poetic for &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;. God has also provided for all the beasts that roam far from men; and the wild ass, swift as an arrow, difficult to be hunted, and living in troops (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, Arabic fera&#770;, root &#1508;&#1512;, Arab. fr, to move quickly, to whiz, to flee; the wild ass, the onager, Arabic himr el-wahs, whose home is on the steppes), is made prominent by way of example. The phrase "to break the thirst" occurs only here. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-12.htm">Psalm 104:12</a>, refers to the &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which are also still the subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-11.htm">Psalm 104:11</a>. The pointing &#1506;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; needlessly creates a hybrid form in addition to &#1506;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (like &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;) and &#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;. From the tangled branches by the springs the poet insensibly reaches the second half of the third day. The vegetable kingdom at the same time reminds him of the rain which, descending out of the upper chambers of the heavens, waters the waterless mountain-tops. Like the Talmud (B. Ta&#8219;an&#305;&#770;th, 10a), by the "fruit of Thy work" (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; as singular) Hitzig understands the rain; but rain is rather that which fertilizes; and why might not the fruit be meant which God's works (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498;, plural) here below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>), viz., the vegetable creations, bear, and from which the earth, i.e., its population, is satisfied, inasmuch as vegetable food springs up as much for the beasts as for man? In connection with &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; the poet is thinking of cultivated plants, more especially wheat; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;, however, does not signify: for cultivation by man, since, according to Hitzig's correct remonstrance, they do not say &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;, and &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; has not man, but rather God, as its subject, but as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-30.htm">1 Chronicles 26:30</a>, for the service (use) of man. </body></html>
