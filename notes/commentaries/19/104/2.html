Not only is light as to the modern poet,<p>“Nature’s resplendent robe,<p>Without whose vesting beauty all were wrapt<p>In unessential gloom,”<p>but it is the dress of <span class= "ital">Divinity, </span>the “ethereal woof” that God Himself is for ever weaving for His own wear.<p><span class= "bld">Curtain.</span>—Especially of a <span class= "ital">tent </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-5.htm" title="I am black, but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.">Song of Solomon 1:5</a>, &c.), the tremulous movement of its folds being expressed in the Hebrew word. Different explanations have been given of the figure. Some see an allusion to the curtains of the Tabernacle (Exodus 26, 27). The associations of this ritual were dear to a religious Hebrew, and he may well have had in his mind the rich folds of the curtain of the Holy of Holies. So a modern poet speaks of<p>“The arras-folds, that variegate<p>The earth, God’s ante-chamber.<p>Herder, again, refers the image to the survival of the nomadic instinct. But there is no need to put a limit to a figure so natural and suggestive. Possibly images of palace, temple, and tent, all combined, rose to the poet’s thought, as in Shelley’s “Ode to Heaven”:—<p>“Palace roof of cloudless nights!<p>Paradise of golden lights!<p>Deep immeasurable vast,<p>Which art now, and which wert then;<p>Of the present and the past,<p>Of the Eternal where and when,<p>Presence-chamber, temple, home,<p>Ever-canopying dome<p>Of acts and ages yet to come!”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>104:1-9 Every object we behold calls on us to bless and praise the Lord, who is great.

The word used here means a curtain or hanging, so called from its tremulous motion, from a word meaning to tremble. Thus it is applied to a curtain before a door; to a tent, etc. It is applied here to the heavens, as they seem to be "spread out" like the curtains of a tent, as if God had spread them out for a tent for himself to dwell in.

Referring, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi think, to the light, which was first created; and indeed this was commanded out of darkness by God the Word, or by the essential Word of God. Light is expressive of the nature of God himself, who is light, and in him is no darkness at all, and who dwells in light (h) inaccessible, and so may be said to be clothed with it; which is applicable to Christ as a divine Person, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>. and to whom this term "light" well agrees; Light being one of the names of the Messiah in the Old Testament, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>, and is often given him in the New Testament, as the author of the light of nature, grace, and glory, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>. He is now possessed of the light and glory of the heavenly state, of which his transfiguration on the mount was an emblem, when his face shone like the sun, and his raiment was as the light, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>. <p>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; alluding to the firmament or expanse, which, being spread out like a curtain, divided between the waters and the waters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6</a>. Heaven is represented as a tent stretched out, with curtains drawn around it, to hide the dazzling and unapproachable light in which the Lord dwells, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a> and it is as a curtain or canopy stretched out and encompassing this earth; the stretching of it out belongs to God alone, and is a proof of the deity of Christ, to whom it is here and elsewhere ascribed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>. Here Christ dwells invisible to us at present; he is received up into heaven, retained there, and from thence will descend at the last day; and in the mean while is within the curtains of heaven, unseen by us. <p>(h) "Pura in luce refulsit alma parens", Virgil.

The canopy of the sky is compared to a tent-curtain, stretched out over the earth. By His simple fiat God spread out these heavens as easily as a man might pitch his tent.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-16.htm">Psalm 103:16</a> &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>.) refers to man, who is compared to grass and flowers. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; with a hypothetical perfect; and the wind that scorches up the plants, referred to man, is an emblem of every form of peril that threatens life: often enough it is really a breath of wind which snaps off a man's life. The bold designation of vanishing away without leaving any trace, "and his place knoweth him no more," is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-10.htm">Job 7:10</a>, cf. ibid. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-18.htm">Job 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-9.htm">Job 20:9</a>. In the midst of this plant-like, frail destiny, there is, however, one strong ground of comfort. There is an everlasting power, which raises all those who link themselves with it above the transitoriness involved in nature's laws, and makes them eternal like itself. This power is the mercy of God, which spans itself above (&#1506;&#1500;) all those who fear Him like an eternal heaven. This is God's righteousness, which rewards faithful adherence to His covenant and conscientious fulfilment of His precepts in accordance with the order of redemption, and shows itself even to (&#1500;) children's children, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a> : on into a thousand generations, i.e., into infinity. </body></html>
