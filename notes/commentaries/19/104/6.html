But here it is beyond its right, and the Divine rebuke forces it to retire within narrower limits. It is noticeable that the idea of a chaos finds no place in the poetic conception of the world’s genesis. The primitive world is not formless, but has its mountains and valleys already existing, though merged beneath the sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/104.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/104-6.htm" title="You covered it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains....">Psalm 104:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou coveredst it with the deep — </span>That is, in the first creation, of which the psalmist is here speaking, when the earth, while yet without form, was covered all over, and, as it were, clothed with the great deep, that vast expansion of air and waters; <span class="ital">the waters stood above the mountains — </span>Those which are now the highest mountains were all under that liquid element. <span class="ital">At thy rebuke — </span>That is, at thy powerful command, which, as it were, rebuked, and thereby corrected and regulated that indigested congeries and confusion of things; <span class="ital">they fled — </span>Namely, the inferior waters; <span class="ital">at the voice of thy thunder — </span>Thy powerful voice, which resounded like thunder; <span class="ital">they hasted away — </span>To the place that thou hadst prepared for them, where they still make their bed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>104:1-9 Every object we behold calls on us to bless and praise the Lord, who is great.

The meaning is, that God covered the earth with the sea - the waters - the abyss - as if a garment had been spread over it. The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>; where, in the account of the work of creation, what is there called "the deep" - the abyss - (the same Hebrew word as here - &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;  teho&#770;m - covered the earth, or was what "appeared," or was manifest, before the waters were collected into seas, and the dry land was seen.<p>The waters stood above the mountains - Above what are now the mountains. As yet no dry land appeared. It seemed to be one wide waste of waters. This does not refer to the Deluge, but to the appearance of the earth at the time of the creation, before the gathering of the waters into seas and oceans, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>. At that stage in the work, all that appeared was a wide waste of waters. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-9. These verses rather describe the wonders of the flood than the creation (Ge 7:19, 20; 2Pe 3:5, 6). God's method of arresting the flood and making its waters subside is poetically called a "rebuke" (Ps 76:6; Isa 50:2), and the process of the flood's subsiding by undulations among the hills and valleys is vividly described.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou coveredst it with the deep; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This refers not to the waters of the flood, when the earth was covered with them, even the tops of the highest mountains; but to the huge mass of waters, the abyss and depth of them, which lay upon the earth and covered it as a garment, at its first creation, as the context and the scope of it show; and which deep was covered with darkness, at which time the earth was without form, and void, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> an emblem of the corrupt state of man by nature, destitute of the image of God, void and empty of all that is good, having an huge mass of sin and corruption on him, and being darkness itself; though this depth does not separate the elect of God, in this state, from his love; nor these aboundings of sin hinder the superaboundings of the grace of God; nor the operations of his Spirit; nor the communication of light unto them; nor the forming and renewing them, so as to become a curious piece of workmanship; even as the state of the original earth did not hinder the moving of the Spirit upon the waters that covered it, to the bringing of it into a beautiful form and order. <p>The waters stood above the mountains; from whence we learn the mountains were from the beginning of the creation; since they were when the depths of water covered the unformed chaos; and which depths were so very great as to reach above the highest mountains; an emblem of the universal corruption of human nature; the highest, the greatest men that ever were, comparable to mountains, have been involved in it, as David, Paul, and others. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou coveredst it with the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> deep as <i>with</i> a garment: the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> waters stood above the mountains.</span><p>(c) You make the sea to be an ornament to the earth.<p>(d) If by your power you did not bridle the rage of the waters, the whole world would be destroyed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

With this thought the poet draws on to the close of his song of praise. The heavens in opposition to the earth, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>, is the unchangeable realm above the rise and fall of things here below. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a> cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; refers to everything created without exception, the universe of created things. In connection with the heavens of glory the poet cannot but call to mind the angels. His call to these to join in the praise of Jahve has its parallel only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1-14</a>. It arises from the consciousness of the church on earth that it stands in living like-minded fellowship with the angels of God, and that it possesses a dignity which rises above all created things, even the angels which are appointed to serve it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>). They are called &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>, and in fact &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, as the strong to whom belongs strength unequalled. Their life endowed with heroic strength is spent entirely - an example for mortals - in an obedient execution of the word of God. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is a definition not of the purpose, but of the manner: obediendo (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> perficiendo). Hearing the call of His word, they also forthwith put it into execution. the hosts (&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;), as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; shows, are the celestial spirits gathered around the angels of a higher rank (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>), the innumerable &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), for there is a hierarchia caelestis. From the archangels the poet comes to the myriads of the heavenly hosts, and from these to all creatures, that they, wheresoever they may be throughout Jahve's wide domain, may join in the song of praise that is to be struck up; and from this point he comes back to his own soul, which he modestly includes among the creatures mentioned in the third passage. A threefold &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; now corresponds to the threefold &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;; and inasmuch as the poet thus comes back to his own soul, his Psalm also turns back into itself and assumes the form of a converging circle. </body></html>
