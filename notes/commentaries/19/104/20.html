The Hebrew verb is that especially used of crawling animals and reptiles, and here, no doubt, his chosen to express the stealthy motion of the beasts when on the track of their prey. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-25.htm" title="So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.">Psalm 104:25</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-8.htm" title="Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.">Job 37:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-40.htm" title="When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?">Job 38:40</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/104.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-20.htm" title="You make darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.">Psalm 104:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou makest darkness — </span>Which succeeds the light, by virtue of thy decree and established order; <span class="ital">and it is night — </span>Which, though black and dismal, contributes to the beauty of nature, and is as a foil to the light of the day. <span class="ital">Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth — </span>To seek their prey, which they are afraid to do in the day-time, God having put <span class="ital">the fear and dread of man upon them, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-2.htm" title="And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, and on every fowl of the air, on all that moves on the earth, and on all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.">Genesis 9:2</a>,) which contributes as much to man’s safety as to his honour.

And see how those are like to the wild beasts, who wait for the twilight, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenous creatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language of grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings which cannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be done in its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he must continue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night comes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works of God. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the more rough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. They are all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designed to serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a new world rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alone lives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soul enters on another state, and his body will be raised, either to glory or to misery. May the Lord send forth his Spirit, and new-create our souls to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/104.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou makest darkness, and it is night - Thou hast made arrangements for the return of night - for the alternations of day and night. The Hebrew word rendered "makest," means "to place;" and the idea is, that God constitutes the darkness, or so disposes things that it occurs.<p>Wherein all the beasts of the forest - The margin is, "the beasts thereof do trample on the forest." The reference is to the beasts which seek their prey at night.<p>Do creep forth - The Hebrew word used here means properly "to creep," as the smaller animals do, which have feet, as mice, lizards, crabs, or as those do which glide or drag themselves upon the ground, having no feet, as worms and serpents. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-30.htm">Genesis 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a>. The allusion here is to the quiet and noiseless manner in which the animals come forth at night in search of their prey, or seem to crawl out of their hiding-places - the places where they conceal themselves in the day-time. The idea is, that the arrangements which God has made in regard to day and night are wisely adapted to the animals which he has placed on the earth. The earth is full of animated beings, accomplishing by day and night the purposes of their existence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-23.

The darkness was before the light, and the night before the day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> and now the darkness and night are made by the setting of the sun before mentioned; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>. <p>Wherein all the beasts of the field do creep forth; out of their dens, and range about for their prey, as the evening wolves and others: and these are not the only creatures that choose the night and darkness; all wicked men do the same; whose deeds are evil, and do not care to come to the light, lest they should be reproved; particularly drunkards, adulterers, thieves, and murderers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>. So the Scribes and Pharisees, when they consulted to take away the life of Christ, and agreed with Judas to betray him, did it in the night: so false teachers, who are wolves in sheep's clothing, when it is a night of darkness with the church, take the advantage of it, to creep about and spread their pernicious doctrines; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou makest darkness, and it is night.</span> The mention of the moon and sun introduces a picture of night (vers. 20, 21) and a picture of the day (vers. 22, 23).

The subject to &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; is &#1502;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1495;. The clause expressing the purpose, which twice begins with an infinitive, is continued in both instances, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, but with a change of subject (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4</a>), in the finite verb. On what is said of wine we may compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>, Sir. 40:20, and more especially Isaiah, who frequently mentions wine as a representative of all the natural sources of joy. The assertion that &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; signifies "before oil  equals  brighter than oil," is an error that is rightly combated by Bttcher in his Proben and two of his "Gleanings," <p>(Note: Proben, i.e., Specimens of Old Testament interpretation, Leipzig 1833, and Aehrenlese (Gleanings), referred to in the preface of these volumes. - Tr.)<p>which imputes to the poet a mention of oil that is contrary to his purpose in this connection wand inappropriate. Corn, wine, and oil are mentioned as the three chief products of the vegetable kingdom (Luther, Calvin, Grotius, Dathe, and Hupfeld), and are assumed under &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>, as is also the case in other instances where distinction would be superfluous, e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22</a>. With oil God makes the countenance shining, or bright and cheerful, not by means of anointing-since it was not the face but the head that was anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17</a>), - but by the fact of its increasing the savouriness and nutritiveness of the food. &#1500;&#1492;&#1510;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500; is chosen with reference to &#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1512;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; does not stand after, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> (where it is &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1470; with Gaja on account of the distinctive), but before the verb, because &#1500;&#1489;&#1489; as that which is inward stands in antithesis to &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as that which is outside. Since the fertilization of the earth by the rain is the chief subject of the predication in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-16.htm">Psalm 104:16</a> is naturally attached to what precedes without arousing critical suspicion. That which satisfies is here the rain itself, and not, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>, that which the rain matures. The "trees of Jahve" are those which before all others proclaim the greatness of their Creator. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; refers to these trees, of which the cedars and then the cypresses (&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, root &#1489;&#1512;, to cut) are mentioned. They are places where small and large birds build their nests and lodge, more particularly the stork, which is called the &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; as being &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (Barbrius, Fab. xiii.), as avis pia (pietaticultrix in Petronius, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6</a>), i.e., on account of its love of family life, on account of which it is also regarded as bringing good fortune to a house.<p>(Note: In the Merg&amp; district, where the stork is not called leklek as it is elsewhere, but charnuk[ on account of its bill like a long horn (Arab. chrn) standing out in front, the women and children call it Arab.

By &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1503; the Jewish tradition understand the coney, after which the Peshto here renders it &#1500;&#1495;&#1490;&#1505;&#1488; (&#1495;&#1490;&#1505;, cuniculus). Both animals, the coney and the rock-badger, may be meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-5.htm">Leviticus 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-7.htm">Deuteronomy 14:7</a>; for the sign of the cloven hoof (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;) is wanting in both. The coney has four toes, and the hyrax has a peculiar formation of hoof, not cloven, but divided into several parts. </body></html>
