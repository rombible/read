The pavilion which God rears for His own abode appears to rest on a floor of rain-clouds, like a tent spread on a flat eastern roof. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm" title="He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.">Psalm 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/9-6.htm" title="It is he that builds his stories in the heaven, and has founded his troop in the earth; he that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.">Amos 9:6-7</a>.) Southey’s description of the Palace of Indra may perhaps help the imagination:—<p>“Built on the lake, the waters were its floor;<p>And here its walls were water arched with fire,<p>And here were fire with water vaulted o’er;<p>And spires and pinnacles of fire<p>Round watery cupolas aspire,<p>And domes of rainbow rest on fiery towers.”<p><span class= "ital">Curse of Kehama.</span><p><span class= "bld">Who maketh the clouds His chariot.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm" title="And he rode on a cherub, and did fly: yes, he did fly on the wings of the wind.">Psalm 18:10</a>, probably the original of this verse; <span class= "ital">chariot </span>(<span class= "ital">rekhûb</span>) here taking the place of <span class= "ital">cherub.</span><p><span class= "bld">Walketh upon the wings of the wind.</span>—Doubtless the metaphor is taken from the clouds, which, in a wind-swept sky, float along like “the drifted wings of many companies of angels.” The clause is thus in direct parallelism with the description of the <span class= "ital">cloud </span>chariot.

We cannot have a more sublime idea of the Deity; serenely walking on an element of inconceivable swiftness, and, as it seems to us, uncontrollable impetuosity.” “How astonishingly magnificent and tremendous is the idea which these words convey to us of the great King, riding upon the heavens, encompassed with clouds and darkness, attended by the lightnings, those ready executioners of his vengeance, and causing the world to resound and tremble at the thunder of his power and the noise of his chariot-wheels. By these ensigns of royalty, these emblems of omnipotence, and instruments of his displeasure, doth Jehovah manifest his presence, when he visiteth rebellious man, to make him own and adore his neglected and insulted Lord.” — Horne.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>104:1-9 Every object we behold calls on us to bless and praise the Lord, who is great.

It is a word which would be properly applied to the construction of a house, and to the right adjustment of the different materials employed in building it. The word rendered "beams" - &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;  &#8219;a&#774;l&#305;&#770;ya&#770;h - means "an upper chamber, a loft," such as rises, in Oriental houses, above the flat roof; in the New Testament, the &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  hupero&#772;on, rendered "upper room," <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-37.htm">Acts 9:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-39.htm">Acts 9:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-8.htm">Acts 20:8</a>. It refers here to the chamber - the exalted abode of God - as if raised above all other edifices, or above the world. The word "waters" here refers to the description of the creation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-7</a> - the waters "above the firmament," and the waters "below the firmament." The allusion here is to the waters above the firmament; and the meaning is, that God had constructed the place of his own abode - the room where he dwelt - in those waters; that is, in the most exalted place in the universe. It does not mean that he made it of the waters, but that his home - his dwelling-place - was in or above those waters, as if he had built his dwelling not on solid earth or rock, but in the waters, giving stability to that which seems to have no stability, and making the very waters a foundation for the structure of his abode.<p>Who maketh the clouds his chariot - Who rides on the clouds as in a chariot.

With this thought the poet draws on to the close of his song of praise. The heavens in opposition to the earth, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>, is the unchangeable realm above the rise and fall of things here below.

In connection with the heavens of glory the poet cannot but call to mind the angels. His call to these to join in the praise of Jahve has its parallel only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1-14</a>. It arises from the consciousness of the church on earth that it stands in living like-minded fellowship with the angels of God, and that it possesses a dignity which rises above all created things, even the angels which are appointed to serve it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>). They are called &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>, and in fact &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, as the strong to whom belongs strength unequalled. Their life endowed with heroic strength is spent entirely - an example for mortals - in an obedient execution of the word of God. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is a definition not of the purpose, but of the manner: obediendo (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> perficiendo). Hearing the call of His word, they also forthwith put it into execution. the hosts (&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;), as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; shows, are the celestial spirits gathered around the angels of a higher rank (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>), the innumerable &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), for there is a hierarchia caelestis. From the archangels the poet comes to the myriads of the heavenly hosts, and from these to all creatures, that they, wheresoever they may be throughout Jahve's wide domain, may join in the song of praise that is to be struck up; and from this point he comes back to his own soul, which he modestly includes among the creatures mentioned in the third passage. A threefold &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; now corresponds to the threefold &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;; and inasmuch as the poet thus comes back to his own soul, his Psalm also turns back into itself and assumes the form of a converging circle. </body></html>
