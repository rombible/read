Another use of the springs, fountains, and rivers of water; by the sides and on the shores of these, some birds delight to be, and on trees that grow here do they build their nests; and here, having wetted their throats, they sit, and chirp, and sing: to doves, by rivers of water, is the allusion in Sol 5:12. <p>Which sing among the branches; of trees that grow by the sides of fountains and rivers; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>. To such birds may saints be compared; being, like them, weak, defenceless, and timorous; liable to be taken in snares, and sometimes wonderfully delivered; as well as given to wanderings and strayings: and to fowls of the heaven, being heaven born souls, and partakers of the heavenly calling. These have their habitation by the fountain of Jacob, by the river of divine love, beside the still waters of the sanctuary; where they sing the songs of Zion, the songs of electing, redeeming, and calling grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">By <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, <i>which</i> sing among the branches.</span><p>(f) There is no part of the world so barren where most evident signs of God's blessing do not appear.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>.

The suffix, referring back to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, is intended to say that the earth hanging free in space (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>) has its internal supports. Its eternal stability is preserved even amidst the judgment predicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>., since it comes forth out of it, unremoved from its former station, as a transformed, glorified earth. The deep (&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;) with which God covers it is that primordial mass of water in which it lay first of all as it were in embryo, for it came into being &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; does not refer to &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; (masc. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-14.htm">Job 28:14</a>), because then &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; would be required, but to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, and the masculine is to be explained either by attraction) according to the model of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>), or by a reversion to the masculine ground-form as the discourse proceeds (cf. the same thing with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-13.htm">2 Samuel 17:13</a>, &#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-6.htm">Exodus 11:6</a>, &#1497;&#1491; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a>, the earth thus overflowed with water was already mountainous; the primal formation of the mountains is therefore just as old as the &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; mentioned in direct succession to the &#1514;&#1492;&#1493; &#1493;&#1489;&#1492;&#1493;. After this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a> describe the subduing of the primordial waters by raising up the dry land and the confining of these waters in basins surrounded by banks. Terrified by the despotic command of God, they started asunder, and mountains rose aloft, the dry land with its heights and its low grounds appeared. The rendering that the waters, thrown into wild excitement, rose up the mountains and descended again (Hengstenberg), does not harmonize with the fact that they are represented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a> as standing above the mountains. Accordingly, too, it is not to be interpreted after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a> : they (the waters) rose mountain-high, they sunk down like valleys. The reference of the description to the coming forth of the dry land on the third day of creation requires that &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; should be taken as subject to &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;. But then, too, the &#1489;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; are the subject to &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, as Hilary of Poictiers renders it in his Genesis, 5:97, etc.: subsidunt valles, and not the waters as subsiding into the valleys. Hupfeld is correct; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a> is a parenthesis which affirms that, inasmuch as the waters retreating laid the solid land bare, mountains and valleys as such came forth visibly; cf. Ovid, Metam. i.:344: Flumina subsidunt, montes exire videntur. </body></html>
