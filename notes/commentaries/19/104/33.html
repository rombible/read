And if mediation on the glories of creation be so sweet to the soul, what greater glory appears to the enlightened mind, when contemplating the great work of redemption! There alone can a sinner perceive ground of confidence and joy in God. While he with pleasure upholds all, governs all, and rejoices in all his works, let our souls, touched by his grace, meditate on and praise him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/104.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live - That is, I will continue to praise him; I will never cease to adore him. The result of the psalmist's meditations on the wonderful works of God is to awaken in his mind a desire to praise God forever. He is so filled with a sense of his greatness and glory that he sees that there would be occasion for eternal praise; or that the reason for praise could never be exhausted. He who has any proper sense of the greatness, the majesty, and the glory of God "intends" to praise him forever. He sees that there is enough in the character of God to demand eternal praise, and he does not anticipate that a period can ever occur in all the future when he will feel that the causes for praise have come to an end, or when his heart will be indisposed to celebrate that praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31-34.

Or, "in my life or lives (w)", throughout the whole of it. This was what the psalmist determined to do, let others do what they would; even sing songs of praise to the Lord; since he was the God of his life, who had fed him all his life long; from whom he had all the mercies of life, and by whom he had been followed with goodness and mercy all his days, and on whom his life and the comforts of it depended. <p>I will sing praise unto my God while I have my being: because he lived, and moved, and had his being in him; and it was continued to him, and he was upheld in it; and not only for his being, but for his well being; as for his temporal, so for his spiritual mercies, which he had from him as his God, as his covenant God; such as peace, pardon, righteousness, and eternal life: a view of God as our own God, such a view as Thomas had of Christ, when he said, "my Lord, and my God", is enough to make a man sing; and when the psalmist says he would do this as long as he lived and had a being, this is not to be understood as if this work would end with his life, or that he had no thought of praising him hereafter; but it signifies his constancy in this employment, while in the land of the living; knowing that in the grave he could not praise the Lord with his bodily organs as now; though he knew that this would be his eternal employ in the world of spirits, in his soul, during its separate state, and in soul and body after the resurrection. <p>(w) "in vita mea", V.

The rich contents of this sixth group flow over and exceed the decastich. With &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (not &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-6.htm">Psalm 92:6</a>) the poet expresses his wonder at the great number of God's works, each one at the same time having its adjustment in accordance with its design, and all, mutually serving one another, co-operating one with another. &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, which signifies both bringing forth and acquiring, has the former meaning here according to the predicate: full of creatures, which bear in themselves the traces of the Name of their Creator (&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;). Beside &#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, however, we also find the reading &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;, which is adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer, represented by the versions (lxx, Vulgate, and Jerome), by expositors (Rashi: &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;), by the majority of the MSS (according to Norzi) and old printed copies, which would signify &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, or according to the Latin versions &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (possessione tua, Luther "they possessions"), but is inferior to the plural ktisma'toon &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, as an accusative of the object to &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;. The sea more particularly is a world of moving creatures innumerable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-35.htm">Psalm 69:35</a>). &#1494;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; does not properly signify this sea, but that sea, yonder sea (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-13.htm">Joshua 9:13</a>). The attributes follow in an appositional relation, the looseness of which admits of the non-determination (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-14.htm">Genesis 43:14</a>, and the reverse case above in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-18.htm">Psalm 104:18</a>). &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; .)  in relation to &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is a nomen unitatis (the single ship). It is an old word, which is also Egyptian in the form hani and ana.<p>(Note: Vide Chabas, Le papyrus magique Harris, p. 246, No. 826: HANI (&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;), vaisseau, navire, and the Book of the Dead 1. 10, where hani occurs with the determinative picture of a ship. As to the form ana, vid., Chabas loc. cit. p. 33.)<p>Leviathan, in the Book of Job, the crocodile, is in this passage the name of the whale (vid., Lewysohn, Zoologie des Talmuds, 178-180, 505). Ewald and Hitzig, with the Jewish tradition, understand &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a> according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-5.htm">Job 41:5</a> : in order to play with him, which, however, gives no idea that is worthy of God.

In &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27</a>, the range of vision is widened from the creatures of the sea to all the living things of the earth; cf. the borrowed passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, by an obliteration of the suffix, signifies directly "altogether," and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>): when it is time for it. With reference to the change of the subject in the principal and in the infinitival clause, vid., Ew. 338, a. The existence, passing away, and origin of all beings is conditioned by God. His hand provides everything; the turning of His countenance towards them upholds everything; and His breath, the creative breath, animates and renews all things. The spirit of life of every creature is the disposing of the divine Spirit, which hovered over the primordial waters and transformed the chaos into the cosmos. &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a> is equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>, and frequently.
